bills on the dock which are going to be
 
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
bills on the dock which are going to be
hearing

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
um as a note for the committee members
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
on our calendar I have put a tentative
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
calendar it's probably going to be more
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
than tentative at noon today where we
 
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
will not be meeting on next Monday
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
and the Thursday of course will be a
 
00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.650 align:start position:0%
and the Thursday of course will be a
session

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to be meeting this
 
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
Thursday either for a work session
 
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's we're going to push that off to
 
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
later on in the calendar so there's you
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
can guarantee this Thursday and next
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
Monday we will be working on Tuesday
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday session on Thursday and we
 
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
will have an exact session all day on
 
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
Friday as well all these schedules will
 
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.490 align:start position:0%
Friday as well all these schedules will
include

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
exact sessions as well so there will be
 
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
a work session on one of those days for
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
some of our finance bills which are
 
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
policy bills as well
 
00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
so that's just a quick note so what I'd
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
like to do is get into house bill 230
 
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
272 this is increasing Charter Public
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
School per pupil funding uh the prime
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
responsible is representative Mooney and
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
water uh recognize and welcome represent
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
money to our committee I'm also going to
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
ask people that are testifying today if
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
something's already been spoken to in
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
testimony about this please don't
 
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
replicate that it will just drag us on
 
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
and put our whole schedule
 
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
in Peril so please try to state to the
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
times that you've
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
requested and and not and and don't
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
repeat what somebody else if you have
 
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
testimony and writing we'd appreciate
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
that too that saves our clerk from
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
having to write all that down we can say
 
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
see attached paperwork
 
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and Welcome to
 
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
our committee thank you much very much
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and good morning to members
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
is representative Maureen Mooney I'm
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
from the town of Merrimack it's
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County District number 12.
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor and here to
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 272 and
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
act relative to increasing chartered
 
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
Public School per pupil funding
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
Now by means of some background public
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
charter schools in New Hampshire are
 
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
funded using this formula
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
there is base adequacy amount per pupil
 
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
then you have what is called in statute
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
and additional Grant
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
edly that is what my bill addresses the
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
additional Grant
 
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
both the adequacy amount and the
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
additional Grant are subject to the
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index
 
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 align:start position:0%
in addition to those two there's also
 
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
applicable differentiated Aid that
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
applies specifically in a statute
 
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
another statute to specific
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances for example English as a
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
second language learning
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
so those three formulas
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
my bill refers only to the additional
 
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 align:start position:0%
Grant piece of the three
 
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
prong formula
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 272 increases the statutory
 
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
additional Grant given to public charter
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
schools per pupil
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
placing the amount in the statute for
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant
 
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.730 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant
as

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
5141 dollars
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
per the fiscal note the increase in
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill 272
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
amounts to
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
one thousand five hundred fourteen
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and twelve cents of an increase
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
per Charter School pupil in fiscal year
 
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.830 align:start position:0%
per Charter School pupil in fiscal year
24.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
24.
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
what is the overall picture
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
the overall is that with this increase
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
the total per pupil for public charter
 
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.650 align:start position:0%
the total per pupil for public charter
schools

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
based on the formula described above
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
or what I mentioned would be
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
approximately now nine thousand dollars
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
per public chartered school pupil
 
00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:24.419 align:start position:0%
this is up
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
from the approximate
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
seven thousand four hundred dollars per
 
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.490 align:start position:0%
seven thousand four hundred dollars per
pupil

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
that public charter schools receive
 
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.690 align:start position:0%
that public charter schools receive
currently

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
there are several reasons for increasing
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
first of all the additional Grant has
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
not been increased since House Bill 517
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
in 2017.
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
so there's not been an increase
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
funding at nine thousand dollars per
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
pupil is still lower
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
than traditional Public Schools where
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
the most recent figure I've heard is an
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
average of nineteen thousand five
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per pupil in traditional
 
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:23.420 align:start position:0%
public school districts
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
increased funding is needed with
 
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
increased enrollment
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
in public chartered schools as we've
 
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.730 align:start position:0%
in public chartered schools as we've
seen

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
a recent article
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
by Ethan DeWitt
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
from November of 2022
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
has a headline of New Hampshire Charter
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
School enrollment increases 14 percent
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
for these reasons
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
and with this description which I hope
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
is clear as it is a tiny bit complicated
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
but I tried to articulate it as best I
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
could in terms of what the bill will do
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
I would ask for your support of the bill
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
if that'll conclude my testimony thank
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you very much are
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli and thank you Mr
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you representative
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
Mooney for uh presenting the bill
 
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
Mooney for uh presenting the bill
um

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there have been a
 
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there have been a
few

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
few
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
that have failed over the past
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
X number of years and I'm just wondering
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
how the finances have played into those
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
failures given the testimony you just
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
gave about the public school traditional
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
public school funding versus Charter uh
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh not knowing specifically the schools
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
you're referring to not having those
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
details I would defer that to um one
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
that would testify after me
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
Representative Mooney
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
did somebody have their hand up over
 
00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
did somebody have their hand up over
there

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%

live in Hooksett I am the chair of the
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees of the Polaris public
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
charter schools one of the successes
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
that you should come and see we have a
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
we have room we're in the old St Patrick
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
School in the west side of Manchester we
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
are not in a high-end neighborhood
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
believe me we are not but we uh educate
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
120 kids from K through five
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
as you probably know Charter Schools
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
allow new students in by Lottery
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
and as I as I have explained the
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
lotteries when the lottery goes on
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
everybody cries people cry when the kid
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
gets in and they cry when the kid
 
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.350 align:start position:0%
gets in and they cry when the kid
doesn't

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh last year we had 80 applicants for
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
eight spaces now I took economics 401 at
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire a long
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
supplying demand rules have not changed
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
they have not changed what had uh one of
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we only had eight spots
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
is because of the uh I think it's in the
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is that if you have a
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
sibling in school
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
this the new sibling jumps a line
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
because it makes sense not to have kids
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to different places
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
17 siblings join our school if that's
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
not a testimony that we are providing an
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
education that parents like I think it
 
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
education that parents like I think it
is

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
what happens to Polaris
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
our electric bill goes up
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
our heating bill goes up our salaries
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
have to go up we're in competition every
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
day with the public with the traditional
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
Public Schools
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
in terms of salaries and here's the
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
place that we have no shot of of making
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
the equal we can't provide the benefits
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the public schools too we can't
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
provide the level of health insurance
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
for a teacher and their family we can't
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide the retirement benefits to do so
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
we always we always lose a spectacular
 
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.050 align:start position:0%
we always we always lose a spectacular
teacher

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
to the regular Public School System we
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
lost to win last week who got a
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
tremendous deal from the city of
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and she was a great great
 
00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:53.899 align:start position:0%
teacher so we we're in competition
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
without additional funding we're really
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
in tough shape for competition we have
 
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
to find people who
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
who believe in our mission
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
and can afford to believe in our mission
 
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:08.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
benefits so I would strongly support the
 
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.509 align:start position:0%
benefits so I would strongly support the
bill

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
I will tell you about the success of the
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
Polaris Public Charter School we just
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
got recharged uh the second time so

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
there is there a theme or philosophy of
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
Polaris versus what is the
 
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:29.060 align:start position:0%

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'll be very quick here I do have
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony to hand in
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
House Bill 272 institutes a 50 increase
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
in the portion of stadia given to
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
Charters that are approved by the State
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
Board of Education which almost all if
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
not all I think are run that way I don't
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
believe there's any Charters that are
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
locally funded or approved at this point
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
there were but I don't think there are
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
any more
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
our opposition to this bill just stems
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
from The Proposal being suggested is
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
that it's being suggested before we
 
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
solve other problems that we really
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
think need to be solved before this
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
should be instituted the National
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
Education Association issues a series of
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
rankings each year that it's among the
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
states in a variety of areas one is the
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
local Aid to States or I'm sorry the
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
state aid to local schools in the 2022
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
report as a percentage of school Revenue
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire once again ranked 49th in
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
the country for the 2021 school year
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
ahead of only Missouri and the least
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount of Aid given
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
this proposal we really just feel is a
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
little premature one of the reasons for
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
that and there's more in the the written
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
is we still have nearly 160 000 students
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
whose traditional Public Schools live
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
under that ranking of 49th and the state
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
eight that affects the communities most
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
adversely who struggle with poverty
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
we need to fix that before we start to
 
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
see changes to the state of poor state
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
board approved Charter funding figures
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
doing so if we were to fix that first
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
that would have the potential to help
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
our public charter schools as well as
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
traditional Charter excuse me
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools since they
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
both receive the base adequacy funding
 
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
in the same way
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions thank you very much
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
if in fact you see us passing
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislation which would increase aid for
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
the traditional public school system and
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
for the public charter schools would you
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
you get yes or no on that thank you
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm wrong
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like you're giving
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
preference to traditional Public Schools
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to Charter Public Schools
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're both Public Schools I'm
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
wondering why you want to help one
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
before you're willing to help the other
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
we want to help both but they're funded
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
a little differently right traditional
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
public schools go through a lot of local
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
property taxes to get the extra funding
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
to reach the you know average amount of
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
nineteen thousand that it is to constant
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
to educate a child in New Hampshire
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
um raising the adequacy for both would
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
help both
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
so we do want to help both but they are
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
funded different so we need to fix the
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
funding system is what we believe
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
um so this committee uh over this
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
session has heard testimony a number of
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
times about traditional public schools
 
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.810 align:start position:0%
times about traditional public schools
that

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
um they're not currently adequately
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
funded where they're at and we need to
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
we need to do something to help them
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
um and without getting into the formula
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
itself just looking at the amount of
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
money schools are actually receiving on
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
a per pupil basis if my math is correct
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
it appears that Charter Public Schools
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
are receiving
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
at least half if not less on a per
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
student basis than traditional public
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
schools are as of right now so is it
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think that Charter Public
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
Schools can operate on that basis when
 
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.830 align:start position:0%
Schools can operate on that basis when
there's

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
clearly been testimony that regular
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
Public Schools can't operate on a much
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
higher funded basis thank you for the
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
question I don't think either public
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
Charters or traditional public Charters
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry traditional Public Schools
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
can operate on the adequacy money given
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
to them by the state
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the issue is the way
 
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
the schools are funded doesn't work
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
neither one of the the types of schools
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
can operate or educate a child on 36
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
3700 that the state says is adequate the
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
other money that comes in is funded
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
differently some is funded by property
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
taxes Charter Schools do it through
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
their board through their budgets Etc
 
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
because they're approved by the State
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
Board of Education not by a local
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
district there were Charter Schools pace
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
for example was a locally funded one
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't I wasn't involved in the
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
specifics I'm not sure why it's not in
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
operation anymore Charter Schools do
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
have the option of being funded locally
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge none are but that's
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
up to the the towns or the cities to do
 
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
up to the the towns or the cities to do
that

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think either one you know
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
they they all get the same adequacy base
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
rate and then additional on top of for
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
whatever Charter Schools do get
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
additional money per student then
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools get
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools get the tax
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
dollars so you know if we're talking
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
about just the state aid that goes to
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
them I don't think either one is
 
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
adequate I don't think either one is
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
adequately funded
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you are
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%

good morning good morning Mr chairman
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to listen
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
um my name is Kimberly Lavallee I'm from
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
Mount Vernon New Hampshire and I'm here
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of HB 272 I will try
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
not to duplicate what has been said
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
I currently serve on three New Hampshire
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
Public Charter School boards and the
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
constant question is what is our funding
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
going to be and how are we going to make
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
the budget work how much fundraising do
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
we need to pay the bills as everybody
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
knows we've been hit hard inflation's up
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
over seven percent we just switched
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
health insurance carriers for three of
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
the schools and that was to support and
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
attempt anyway to drive down the cost
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
and maintain quality benefits
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
73.38 this year is simply not enough we
 
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:13.580 align:start position:0%
just heard the schools can't
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools can't
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
function at over nineteen thousand we
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
provide everything with the exception of
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
the transportation and special education
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
is funded from the sending District we
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
handle the 504s everything else falls to
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
the public charter schools we are public
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
schools and we need to be able to take
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
care of our teachers our staff most
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
importantly provide the education follow
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
our mission that we've promised the
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education when we were
 
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.010 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education when we were
approved

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to touch on something that
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
hasn't been brought up but I heard it's
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
it's getting tossed around out there and
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
it came to my attention
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
the 10 lowest performing schools in the
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire included seven
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
charter schools and I know that's been
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned somewhere along the way and
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
other people are discussing it I think
 
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:03.980 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting beyond that headline
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
that five of those schools were created
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
to support students who are at risk of
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
dropping out or dropped out so I think
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
we should be applauding those schools
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
supporting those schools and more
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
importantly supporting the students that
 
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
attend those schools that have made a
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
commitment to go back and finish their
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
education and take an active place in
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Workforce which we all
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
know we hear about it we read about it
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble finding people so
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
just keep that in mind when you hear
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
those numbers five of the seven are
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
intended to support those students and
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
they're doing a great job
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you like the
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay good morning chairman lad and
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee I
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for listening to my
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
testimony today and uh I will not repeat
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said I'm here to
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to HB 272 not
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
um any disliker Charter Schools but
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
because it does not apply to all public
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
schools so if this bill were saying to
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
raise the funding for all public schools
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
I would be speaking in favor of it
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
um I want to be clear an extra thousand
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
dollars in adequacy Aid or grants to all
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
public schools would go a long way we
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
all have electricity costs heat and
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
costs benefits costs have gone up in
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
recent years and it is hard to retain
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
qualified staff to teach our students
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
and all of our students deserve a great
 
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.730 align:start position:0%
and all of our students deserve a great
education

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
um as previous speakers have noted
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
there are costs that remain with the
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
traditional Public School District even
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
when a student's family chooses to put
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
them in a charter school and they're
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to get the lottery
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
placement the traditional Public School
 
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:15.299 align:start position:0%
District still carries the cost of
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
special education in their budget they
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
still carry the cost of transportation
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
for students who live within the
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the district so when you
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
are comparing
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
the per pupil cost
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
in a district school to a charter school
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
you do need to remember that those
 
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
numbers stay with the Traditional School
 
00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:38.179 align:start position:0%
District and just a couple more numbers
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are over 160 000 students going to
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools or
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
neighborhood public schools and there
 
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
are currently about 5500 going to
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools they all deserve a great
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
education and if we want to increase the
 
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
funding for all of them that is what we
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
should be talking about we should not
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
lose sight of those 160 000 students
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
to focus on just bettering one group of
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
students and that is all I have to say
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm opposing this particular
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
bill right now thank you very much are
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent I will take a question I don't
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
know if I'll have the answer
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what the average cost
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
per pupil of transportation and special
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
ed is
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
actually I do not have those numbers I'm
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
not going to try and and give you a
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
figure because I don't want to be
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
inaccurate I can do a little research
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
and look it up an average cost for
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
special ed is actually very
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
misleading because you can have special
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
ed services that do not cost very much I
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand doesn't mean much and you can
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
have specialized services that cost a
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
great deal because a student need to
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
highly specialize program such as
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
um you know one figure that leaves to
 
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
mind is the Perkins School for the Blind
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
um where it's in our district placement
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
and it can cost over a hundred thousand
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so it's going to vary
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
greatly and an average is misleading
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
um as for transportation I would have to
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
get some figures for you but I can try
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
and follow up on that thank you very
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
much uh just as a note uh we do have
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
Finance from doe here and maybe they
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
know yeah and what I'm saying to the
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
committee here if you have technical
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions such as that hold them off and
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
we you know write them down for yourself
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
and we can ask Mark at the end as to
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
that so I don't think you have to worry
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
about getting that information to us
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay we'll get in that other direction
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you through the questions now
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
see you thank you very much okay
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman Ladd
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and House Education members my name for
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
the record is Beth McClure I am one of
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the founders and principal at strong
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
Foundations Charter School this is our
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
16th year and it's also the 16th year
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
that I've been principal and had to make
 
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.130 align:start position:0%
that I've been principal and had to make
budgets

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
for our Charter School
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
our mission is to bring Orton Gillingham
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
education to all children in order to
 
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:28.700 align:start position:0%
improve reading scores and also to
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate the core knowledge
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum from Edie Hirsch so that our
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
students get a good solid background
 
00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:38.419 align:start position:0%
in their education
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have a further mission to do Outreach
 
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
with traditional public schools and
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh to train teachers in Norton
 
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.909 align:start position:0%
uh to train teachers in Norton
Gillingham

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
Gillingham
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
I have done that and reached out and
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
trained teachers in over 20 different
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
District public schools in New Hampshire
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
we have a good relationship with our
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
districts and
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not trying to minimize what
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
the people who have been speaking in
 
00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:08.779 align:start position:0%
opposition for the bill have said
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
however I think it's a false argument to
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
say that we need to wait
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
to increase the state contribution to
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools because that is all we
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
get we only get the same Aid because we
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
are Statewide we are unable to collect
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
any property taxes
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
when we are approved by the State Board
 
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
I would quickly Echo that it's very
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to hang on to teachers when we
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
cannot provide the benefits or come
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
close to the salaries that
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
the traditional Public Schools offer
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:58.220 align:start position:0%
make an offer to a teacher that I know
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
is a challenge for them to meet but we
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
do manage to hold on to our teachers
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
because they appreciate our mission and
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
we still do lose several each year
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
because we can't compete
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
so I would speak in favor of the bill
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
because that fifteen hundred dollars is
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
an immediate need
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that we can begin to hold on to our
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
that is the end of my testimony so I
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
don't duplicate
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Beth are the
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%

thank you for being here uh three
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
questions for you how many students do
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
you serve
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
what is your budget and how what percent
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
of that budget do you do in fundraising
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
we have a little over 320 students our
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
budget is about 2.5 million dollars
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
um a very only a very small portion of
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
our budget is through fundraising
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
because of the amount of work that we
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
put in just trying to run the school
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%

sport or committee I should say
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't originally going to testify
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
today but I find myself at a unique
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
position to do so
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
um my name's uh representative wood I
 
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:51.500 align:start position:0%

Pittsfield and Chichester I served on
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
the school board in Pittsfield and I've
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
been trying to improve the traditional
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
public school for over 15 years being
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
involved with every board every
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee every asset of Pittsfield High
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
School a year ago I didn't know anything
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
about charter schools and I went from
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
there to being on the on the advisory
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
team starting at full disclosure
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
starting of uh Charter's Public Charter
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
School modern the Benjamin Franklin
 
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.390 align:start position:0%
School modern the Benjamin Franklin
Academy

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh during this process I've been uh
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity to uh visit
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
several uh charter schools and I want to
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
tell you they are amazing if you have
 
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
not been there you need to go to a
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
charter school and see the difference
 
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
and it's a huge difference
 
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.589 align:start position:0%
and it's a huge difference
um

00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
I said I want to talk wrong so I'll I'll
 
00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
stick to that
 
00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:53.870 align:start position:0%
stick to that
um

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
I believe in bang for the buck I don't
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
I'm a conservative uh person I don't
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
believe in just spending money I work
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
through the budgets of a Traditional
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
School Board and I know what I can do
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
with 1500 uh dollars there trust me I
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
can do a lot more from what I've seen in
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
the uh Charter Schools is incredible
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
bang for the buck they haven't gotten an
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
increase the overall process is a huge
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
saving for the state and the sooner we
 
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:29.420 align:start position:0%
get people to understand that the better
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think the uh the state uh board that
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
did a really good job putting the
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
charter to I'm sorry putting the RSA
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
together that allows the start of a
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
charter school a public charter school
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
in there there's a provision to do
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
conversions of regular schools and again
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
this is outside I apologize this is
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
outside in the frame of this
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
conversation but I do suggest that the
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
board looks at uh the good that's been
 
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:01.940 align:start position:0%
done there how it translates to the
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
Charter School the flexibility we have
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
in putting Benjamin Franklin together is
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
amazing it's a flexibility I never ever
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
seen in the public school school system
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
so all the years I spent there so and
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
again I'm not again I'm a parent
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I wish I could say I was a papa bear
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
but uh not I don't come close to the
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
mama bears but um
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
I I do uh have a lot of experience with
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
the with the school system I have a PhD
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm planning on teaching at Benjamin
 
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
Franklin without
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
um a certification because I'm allowed
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
to do it I have a PhD from MIT I think
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
it qualifies me to do to do that in both
 
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
physics and chemistry so these type of
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
flexibilities are definitely what the
 
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
state needs to look at and it's right in
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
your backyard there's over 30 of them I
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
think there's five more that would were
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
approved we were recently approved on
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
December 8th of this year the day after
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
I was sworn in so there were two amazing
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
days of my life so with that I'll open
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
my open my um this any questions and
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
again thank you for giving me the
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity this to address this board
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there questions
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
all right yes represent Allison oh thank
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you mentioned
 
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
in your testimony the charter conversion
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
factor that that can be in play
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
converting a public school to a Charter
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
Public School is that the case of the
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Franklin Academy and are you
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
aware of any any schools in the state
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
that have transitioned from a public
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
school to a public charter school Under
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
the charter conversion uh it's a great
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
question and actually we're not going to
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
go there because that's off we do know
 
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
that Charter conversion we passed that
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
bill last year to change the process for
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
getting into a charter conversion we had
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
one that's no longer in the state so we
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
have no Charter conversions in the state
 
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
right now to answer that but let's stick
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
to this particular question which we're
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with the funding for
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
Charters please so we can get done we
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
have a number of cards left here
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%

00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
oh is it
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
are you related to our senator
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
um we tend to hang out together okay
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward is chair senator
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
the um since an MIT degree is supposed
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
to be some thing I have three degrees
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
from MIT and I am having the biggest
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
fight of my life because I'm not happy
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
with what they're doing with education
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
so I have very mixed feelings about this
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
whole thing my name is Fred watt I live
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
in started I'm a meteorologist
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
I've spent a lot of time
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of energy and a lot of money
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
because I'm one of the founders of the
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
lionheart Classical Academy which we
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
started four months ago in Peterborough
 
00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:27.770 align:start position:0%
started four months ago in Peterborough
now

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
I don't ever expect to get the money
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
back but I sure would love to get the
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
energy back if I could uh the front of
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
my six daughters
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
but that remains to be seen
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
I don't want to discuss money I'd love
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
to but others have done a nice job with
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
that I think that McDonald's we don't
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
have to have much of an argument I would
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
like to make one very important choice
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
and in many ways it's more important
 
00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:57.380 align:start position:0%
than the money
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
what we're really doing here is to try
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
to even up
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
the way that public charter schools in
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
this sense compete with public schools
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
when we started this we were shooting
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
for 150 students and we were way
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
oversubscribed so we read it but raised
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
at the 200 students and we still are
 
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.609 align:start position:0%
at the 200 students and we still are
oversubscribed

00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
oversubscribed
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
now I'll make the argument that we could
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
put more money into both the public
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
schools or in the public charter schools
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
or in private schools or whatever
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
but the most important thing here is
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
what we hear from the parents of the
 
00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:39.980 align:start position:0%
kids who are sending them to our school
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
they loved the choice
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
are they making good choices I wish I
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
always made good choices I hope I made
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
mostly ones but my daughters would
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes disagree
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
this is not about money well it is about
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
money but in a sense it's not it's about
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
evening it up so that we can afford we
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
meet each other school people can afford
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
to offer to potential students at choice
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's up to them to make a choice
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
they may be right they may be wrong and
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
I certainly haven't made all my good
 
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
choices but I would like to have that
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's the only message
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
I want to have all of this is about is
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
evening up so that the parents of the
 
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
kids all of whom believe they're helping
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
the kids I certainly believe that but
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
they don't always agree
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's to help the kids and the parents
 
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
that have a choice I think that's the
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
key thank you thank you very much are
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%

committee for the opportunity to be here
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Bob best I'm from Merrimack
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
um I am also
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
um on the chair on the on the board of
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
several Charter Schools I'm the chair of
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the board of the founders Academy in
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm the treasurer on the
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
board of spark Academy also in
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
um also worked with a foundation that
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
has been created to offer some knowledge
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
exchange among startups for charter
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
schools to know sort of how to how to
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
get things going and how to do all the
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
things that you need to do because most
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the time charter schools are
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
initiated by a group of parents who have
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
an idea and then they need a lot more
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge to convert that idea into
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
running a school
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
I am a big supporter of school choice
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's why I spend so much time I spend
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours of my own time
 
00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.020 align:start position:0%
volunteering for charter schools
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
offering to help them out all over the
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
place I also do some with my law
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
practice I'm an attorney at Sullivan
 
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:22.550 align:start position:0%
practice I'm an attorney at Sullivan
Hollis

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hollis
 
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.450 align:start position:0%
Hollis
um

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
but school choice is incredibly
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
important and it doesn't mean that you
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
have to choose a charter school I have
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
four kids they all went to the Merrimack
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
Public Schools and they all did fine
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes Public Schools traditional
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
public schools are the right fit for
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
students and sometimes they're not and
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's why one of the great things about
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools and the idea of school
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
choice is that for certain students you
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
can isolate and focus on a stem school
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
or a music-based school or a classic
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
based school or a history based school
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the classrooms are a
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
little smaller but always the focus is a
 
00:44:59.410 --> 00:44:59.420 align:start position:0%
little bit more tailored to a mission
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
and you can have some success with some
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
students that might not have had success
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
in another environment I know there's
 
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion with sort of
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
the comparing casting of public
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
traditional public schools and charter
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to avoid that a little bit
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's an Apples to
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
Apples comparison the schools really do
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
quite a lot different things and and do
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
it in a different way
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
the the existing funding for charter
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
schools which all outcomes from the
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
state at seventy four hundred dollars
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
ish amounts to about forty one dollars a
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
day per student
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
um through the course of the year if
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
this bill passes that would increase to
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars a day per student
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
and I think that that should give you
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
some perspective on the value that you
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
get out of a charter school forty or
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars a day if you're gonna hire
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
a babysitter for your kid you wouldn't
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
get through the whole day on fifty or
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
forty dollars a day uh just for that and
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
to actually convert all of that into a
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
real education with teachers with
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors with all of the
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
other things that go on providing a
 
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive curriculum as best you can
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
is real value real value in charter
 
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.650 align:start position:0%
is real value real value in charter
schools

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:08.660 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think that to some extent we know that
 
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
we will have a different funding stream
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
than traditional public schools and to
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
some extent that makes us make uh uh
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
different and and sometimes good
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
decisions which are also learning
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the students so for
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
example if we try to offer a class and
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
not enough students sign up to make the
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
class go much in the way a college would
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
do we might have to change the the
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
schedule and not offer that class if
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
there's not enough people to to make the
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
class viable
 
00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:41.510 align:start position:0%
class viable
um

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
and and for our students and our
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
community to realize that we're making
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
those kinds of value judgments and we're
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
spending the money as wisely as we can
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have campaigns for supplies
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh copy paper is donated to the school
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
because it's part of what's necessary to
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
support it parents that donate school
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
supplies and all those kinds of things
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
and although we'd love to be able to
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of extra money for
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
those things the campaign to the
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
community that says we want and need
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
those donations is important and it
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
shows them again that we have a value
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
for how we spend and receive their money
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless as much as we can learn
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
from being Frugal and being as efficient
 
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:27.500 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
we still are in a place where the budget
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
and the financing is very very thin
 
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:34.940 align:start position:0%
we're not able to pay our teachers
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
comparable to what a traditional public
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
school or a private school would do we
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
don't offer the same kind of benefits
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
that they do although we do our best to
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
provide benefits it isn't as it isn't
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
equivalent we don't have the same broad
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
array of classes that are available in
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
other traditional public schools and
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
even just sort of basic science
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
equipment I can remember we had a donors
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
choose Campaign which is sort of like
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
GoFundMe but for a different different
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
Source but if donors choose campaign to
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
have some science equipment we wanted to
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
have a seismograph in our school and a
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
teacher you know showed the initiative
 
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
and went through the effort of doing it
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
and those things are great and they're
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
real successes for the community but at
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
the same time I think the School of
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
Public School a lot to be able to buy
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
its equipment for its science labs and
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
and its classrooms and things and be
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
able to afford it
 
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a whole lot more to add
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
to the discussion than that I I know
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
that again there's been some comparisons
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
between traditional Public Schools uh
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're fantastic and we would never you
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
know show up and listen and weigh in on
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
a funding bill for them and say you know
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
don't vote for it
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
um they're the right choice for certain
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
students and charter schools are a great
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
choice every student in New Hampshire
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
should have a choice right if this
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
school isn't right for them they'd have
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to try something
 
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.030 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to try something
different

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony here today I'd be
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions that you
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
have if you have any thank you attorney
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
best representative cardelli
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
attorney best for being here
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering um about the
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
financial stability of the two charters
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
you're involved in
 
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
um as my first question sure so uh
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
Founders Academy has a fairly strong
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
financial position because it's gotten
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
to the point that it's got 430 to 450
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
students and a budget of over three
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
million dollars but nevertheless
 
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
um there's uh constant pressures I know
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
that um throughout education not just in
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
charter schools but throughout education
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
Cove had put a tremendous amount of
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
pressure on teachers there's a a huge
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
shift in teachers leaving the profession
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so you've got to do something to
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
take pressure off of teachers and all of
 
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:51.260 align:start position:0%
those initiatives that you would take
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
would cost you some money and when the
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
budget is all used up you really don't
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
have the latitude to do those kinds of
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
things so I don't think that the school
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
is in Risk in risk of closing but but
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
every year there's more and more
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
struggles with how do you find a new
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
teacher because one of your teachers
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
left retired or left teaching altogether
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing spark Academy the
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
other one is a lot different spark
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
Academy is a partnership on the campus
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
of Manchester Community College where
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
students will get college credit while
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
they're going through high school and
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's a much smaller student body and it
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
relies heavily on private fundraising I
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
think that they spend something like 11
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
or 12 000 per student but only have 7
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
300 from or 7 400 from the state so the
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
rest is Gap filled with private
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
donations and the school has to dedicate
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of time to that so thank you
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh thank you
 
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.490 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh thank you
um

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
I'll maybe I'll ask about Founders
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
rather than uh Sparks but
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
um what would be the impact
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
um local public schools and the
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
taxpayers if let's say Founders were to
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
run into financial difficulty and have
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
but hypothetically when a when a charter
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
school closes
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
um the the State Department of Education
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
would probably be involved as early as
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
they could be to try to create a soft
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
Landing for however that played out so
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't immediate or abrupt but
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
let's suppose it was abrupt and you know
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
you realize you can't make payroll we're
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
closing in four days
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
all of those students have to be pushed
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
back into the traditional Public Schools
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
transferring records finding schedules
 
00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:45.140 align:start position:0%
and reintegrating into those schools
 
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:48.500 align:start position:0%
Founders Academy draws from 20 20 towns
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
mostly Manchester but 20 towns
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
surrounding it and I'm sure it would be
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
quite an impact on them obviously their
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
funding system is what it is and they've
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
got taxing Authority and federal funds
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
and state funds and I don't really even
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
understand their funding formula
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
completely so I can't really comment on
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
what the financial impact might be good
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
about or otherwise thank you represent
 
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.809 align:start position:0%
about or otherwise thank you represent
miler

00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
miler
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
here and presenting your testimony just
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
two questions uh first what is the
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
curriculum for Founders one and secondly
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the budget how much of that is
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
through fundraising thank you sure
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the curriculum Founders is
 
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:31.700 align:start position:0%
a as a a classical uh education model
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
with a focus on studying the the
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
founders that are mentioned in the name
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
it are the founders of our country
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
um great men and women uh in history and
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
learning through classical education
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
focused on leadership and character and
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things very civics-minded
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
school but it also has you know computer
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
classes and science classes and all
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things as well because
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
you need to these days
 
00:52:59.530 --> 00:52:59.540 align:start position:0%
um let's see your second question was
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
fundraising how much fundraising
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
um it has been actually a bit better uh
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
recently but it probably ends up being
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
around 40 or 50 000 a year on a three
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget so it's less than
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
um actually it's less than
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
five percent or a couple percentage
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
points anyway not doing my math in my
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
head I don't have the MIT degree I guess
 
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559 align:start position:0%
Tulane isn't the same
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cascadden
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um representative Vlad and
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation as well
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
as the other presenters
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
um just inform the committee before I I
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're the right person to
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
answer my question but I did serve on a
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
public charter Board of Trustees for
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
four years and actually presented at
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
National Conference on its successes in
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
the North Country Charter Academy which
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad is very familiar
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
with was actually formed and opened by
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
public school superintendents but the
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
superintendents in the school districts
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
do not operate it it's independent so
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's a very different model but my
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
question is charter schools have
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
different grade levels and I don't know
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
um have the high school level program
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
and if you know that number or somebody
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
knows that number what is the percentage
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
of the graduation rate because
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
graduation at a public charter school is
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
probably the one of the most exciting
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
days of the year because those kids did
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
not succeed in traditional public
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you have that
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
information I know that both of the
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
charter schools that I'm on the board of
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
are are have a high school spark is
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
entirely high school and Founders is
 
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
fifth grade through 12th grade and so it
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
has a high school and I don't know what
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
percentage of all charter schools are
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
high schools versus middle schools and
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
elementary schools some of them are as
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
much as K-12 or at least they have the
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
ambition to be but you're right
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
graduation day is a pretty fantastic
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
thing and one of the real privileges
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
that I've had from being involved in
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
charter schools as the chair of Founders
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
Academy is every single diploma we've
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
issued has my signature on it I sign a
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of things I'm a lawyer I'm a
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
planning board member there's nothing
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
more important in the world than signing
 
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
somebody's diploma for them this year
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
Founders Academy has 14 seniors and I
 
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
think when we did our board meeting two
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
weeks ago we have a wall where we show
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
the colleges that they've been accepted
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
to 20 college acceptances for the 14
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
students so far and we're still working
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
on it and so fantastic results for that
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I've ever calculated
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
whether our what our graduation rate is
 
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's close to 100 because I
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
can't think of too many students who
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
have gotten that far and didn't succeed
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
maybe one or two here and there but um
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very high graduation rate and a
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
lot of success getting into colleges
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and and for some Charter Schools
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
Founders Academy included we don't
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily insist that a college is the
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
only path for somebody if career or
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
technical education is the right thing
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
for a student that's a victory and a
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
success too
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the questions
 
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.109 align:start position:0%

thank you super Spock Academy yes uh how
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
many students about
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh let's see it's got its senior year
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
this year it's probably about 60 to 80
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
something like that students these are
 
00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:23.390 align:start position:0%
something like that students these are
all

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
dropped out of the public school you
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
said either at rushes no these are not
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
dropped out from public schools these
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
are students who've chose to to come
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
there based on what spark offers but
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's a very stem based school on the
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
campus of Manchester Community College
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I thought I heard you say
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
it was an at-risk school okay thank you

00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
most important is I support this bill
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%

um but I think if I didn't it would be a
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
missed opportunity
 
00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:52.579 align:start position:0%

ASD is in its 16th year of operation
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
we are a stem focused School

serving students in grades 6 through 12.
 
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:45.740 align:start position:0%
we serve students from
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
29 different communities
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
seven percent of our kiddos are English

accommodation plan
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
and we also have I believe five percent
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
of our students are on special education

students
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
so we are
 
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.390 align:start position:0%
so we are
um

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
54 of our school is non-white
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
the reason that I bring up those
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
demographics is because ASD also
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
listed as the number one school in New

by U.S news and World Report and that's
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
one metric right but we've also
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrated success
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
using a lot of other different rubrics
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
like the National Blue Ribbon award from

and
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
so the lens that I want to speak with
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
you about
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to all of the the funding
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
models and the discussion that goes
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
along with all of that is
 
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.490 align:start position:0%
along with all of that is
um

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:27.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're running a highly
 
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.650 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're running a highly
successful

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
stem Focus Charter School
 
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:39.740 align:start position:0%
that has a role in this state to help
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
improve the stem Workforce here in New
 
01:00:43.319 --> 01:00:44.210 align:start position:0%
improve the stem Workforce here in New
Hampshire

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's something that I think we can all
 
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
agree is a very valuable and important
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
thing for us to be doing
 
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:55.690 align:start position:0%
thing for us to be doing
I

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
just returned from a a board meeting I
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
sit on the national Consortium of
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
secondary stem schools it's a national
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
board a National Organization where all
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
of these leaders from all of these stem
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
schools come together and they talk
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
about what they're doing in different
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
parts of the country it was very
 
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.450 align:start position:0%
parts of the country it was very
insightful

01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:16.460 align:start position:0%
insightful
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
because one of the first things that
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me was the tremendous
 
01:01:21.299 --> 01:01:22.630 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me was the tremendous
disparity

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
disparity
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
in the amount of money that these
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
different schools charter schools
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
public charter schools private schools
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
and so on and traditional schools all
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
around the country that are focused on
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
stem our school was at the very very
 
01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:43.460 align:start position:0%
very bottom
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
of of the of the pile in terms of the
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
amount of money spent per student
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a significant issue
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
um running a stem school
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
um on 7 300 something dollars
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
um is really challenging
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
um we can't put the materials in the
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
hands of the kids that they need to do
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
the work that we all want them to be
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
doing so that they go off into college
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
and and career and build great great
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.210 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
we have been successful
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
um in in doing the work that we've been
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
doing with our kids
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
and people will say well geez if you're
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
all you know if you if you were able to
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
be that successful with the amount of
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
money that you're currently working with
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
and why do you need more and I would say
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
to you that the reason that we have been
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
successful is truly we are running a
 
01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:49.430 align:start position:0%
successful is truly we are running a
passion

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're running on passion
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
we we don't have
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
um the the funding to to Really
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
um support our teachers so I see them
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know leaving our school and and
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
going off to do second jobs and third
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
jobs and I know that's not unusual to
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools the same thing is true
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
um you know for all of our Educators all
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
of our our Public School teachers
 
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.470 align:start position:0%
of our our Public School teachers
um

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
but we're doing so without even really
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
being able to offer competitive salaries
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
even as compared to a public school
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
teacher in a traditional District
 
01:03:25.559 --> 01:03:26.690 align:start position:0%
teacher in a traditional District
um

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
they don't really have a retirement plan
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
just that alone
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
asking those individuals to come in over
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
50 percent of whom are certified
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
teachers and I believe very strongly in
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know in continuing that work we have
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of teachers who are in the
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
pipeline who came from industry who are
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
interested in becoming uh certified
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
teachers here in the state
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
um but it's very hard for us to hold on
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
to them it's very hard for them to hold
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
without without uh without even being at
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
a competitive salary level to a
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
traditional public school teacher
 
01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:12.289 align:start position:0%
traditional public school teacher
um

01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
our families are running on passion
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
because they have to tolerate
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
fundraising emails from me all the time
 
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.589 align:start position:0%
fundraising emails from me all the time
um

01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
they have to come in to sub for their
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
kids classes well they don't have to but
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
they choose to right so we're able to
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
make a lot of things work because of
 
01:04:30.059 --> 01:04:31.250 align:start position:0%
make a lot of things work because of
passion

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
passion
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
our students
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
we have classrooms that are don't have
 
01:04:36.299 --> 01:04:37.370 align:start position:0%
we have classrooms that are don't have
walls

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
we added doors to some classrooms a few
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
years ago over Christmas vacation and
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
you would have thought that you know we
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
that they were the hallways were lined
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
in Gold everybody was so excited
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but we we've asked our students to
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
also kind of run on this passion
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
and to deal with shared equipment at a
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
level that is is we've had to say no to
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
kids who want to do really great senior
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
projects because we can't afford to put
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
the tools in their hands
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
so this what I believe to be a
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
reasonable modest increase would be a
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
game changer for our school
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so thank you for hearing me thank
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for the
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
work you're doing because obviously it's
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
having an impact uh two questions one
 
01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
what I've asked others uh what percent
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
of your budget is through fundraising
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
which you've mentioned and also would
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
you outline uh the Partnerships that you
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
have with industry particularly on your
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
particular school thank you absolutely
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
so we run on about a 3.8 million dollar
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
budget we're serving 525 kids
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we are actually approved recently to
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually expand to a fifth grade program
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the fall so we're excited about
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
getting students at an even younger age
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
um involved in in stem education
 
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:18.380 align:start position:0%
and our
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
fundraising percentage is about just a
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
little under five percent we bring in
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
anywhere from about a hundred and fifty
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
thousand to two hundred thousand dollars
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
on a good year uh closer to two hundred
 
01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:33.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and those are mostly
 
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:36.500 align:start position:0%
there's some grants associated with that
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
and then also just family giving and
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
corporate giving so
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
um the the second part of your question
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
um a huge part of our strategic plan is
 
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:50.780 align:start position:0%
our corporate engagement
 
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
we look to
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so a hundred percent of our graduates
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
complete an internship
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
and and very often in some type of stem
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
field so we have
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
um you know we have students who
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of students who
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
complete internships through Bae I mean
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
Bae is incredible
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of the programs that they
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
have established that serve charter
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
schools and traditional district schools
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
and private schools they're a model to
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
follow I think in a lot of ways but we
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
also have you know the the local
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who has kids assisting with
 
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:37.940 align:start position:0%
surgeries you know the local dentist
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
who who came in and saw a need for uh
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
our students to have he's a chemistry
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
guy and so he built a lab for our
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
chemistry students
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
we do a tremendous amount of Outreach
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
to several local
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
businesses to have people come in to
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
present to our kids
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
um you know anything from the you know
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
the the physics of fountain pens
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
um to the science behind elections so
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of a lot of people who we
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
can get in to to work with our students
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and and do that sort of thing the
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
next phase is really to formalize a
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
process where we're able to get
 
01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:28.699 align:start position:0%
information from
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
our local industry leaders to find out
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
what skills and talents they want to see
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
in in their Workforce coming up so we're
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
working on that now with our academic
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
committee to start building that
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
relationship before we go on with more
 
01:08:47.809 --> 01:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
questions we're going to lose the
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
technical support from the Department of
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
Education if we don't get them up here
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
quickly they have to be in finance right
 
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.189 align:start position:0%
quickly they have to be in finance right
now

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:08:59.450 --> 01:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
um are there any more questions for the
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
current president yeah
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
represent Allison thank you Mr chair and
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for being here two
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
quick questions that relate to uh
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
feeding students do you know what
 
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
percentage of your students would
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
qualify before you reduce price lunches
 
01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:19.580 align:start position:0%
under the U.S department of Agriculture
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines into how you handle feeding
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh so right we um we
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
send out at the beginning of the school
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
year just like every other school a
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
request for students to report on free
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
um we are very aware that there is
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
um a need for a group of our students
 
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I I would say we are probably at
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
about oh gosh probably like three to
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
three percent maybe three to five
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
percent of our students who are
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
reporting is free reduced lunch that's
 
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
the official number
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the real number the real day-to-day
 
01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.669 align:start position:0%
um the real number the real day-to-day
number

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
um is we have
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
um several other students that we just
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
provide lunch for because we know that
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a need we have
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
students that you know so if I were to
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
that I would say that that number would
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
would increase
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we probably have uh
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 students who we're providing
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
things for
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
um you know anything from a laptop
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we have a great program
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
through the United Way in Nashville so
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
we're able to to take care of some of
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
our kiddos that way we have served a
 
01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:45.620 align:start position:0%
couple of homeless students in the past
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
I would say that it is
 
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.930 align:start position:0%
I would say that it is
um

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
it's something that we that we
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly about making sure
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
that those kids have equal access to
 
01:10:57.719 --> 01:10:58.610 align:start position:0%
that those kids have equal access to
everything

01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so if it's a field trip they're on
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
the field trip you know yeah thank you
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairman you're
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much for your
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
presentation presentation today thank
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
you very much yep I'd like to call
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
forward the department uh of Education
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
for the for the record Mark Manganiello
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Office of school
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
Finance I'm here if anyone has any
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions and needs technical assistance
 
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming forward to answer
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard that the difference
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
between a traditional public school and
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
a Charter Public School is that the
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
traditional public the sending that the
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
resident District still has to pay for
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
transportation and special ed and but we
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
also know that there's a lot of special
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
ed that's covered by the state and other
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
things so I'm wondering what the if you
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
know what the average cost for that
 
01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:07.580 align:start position:0%
transportation for transportation for a
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
traditional public school and the
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
average cost that a traditional Public
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
School actually pays you know from the
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
school as opposed to by the state for
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
a dump off the top of my head have a or
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
maybe I could do some quick math on the
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
sped state revenue versus local Revenue
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
but um I'll I'll just give you a couple
 
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.189 align:start position:0%
but um I'll I'll just give you a couple
numbers

01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:31.870 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:35.420 align:start position:0%
uh just some really rough math
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
transportation is about a thousand
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
dollars per student
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
um getting into the details and coming
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
up with the methodology that's really
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
precise is challenging because we have
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
to we would have to know all the tuition
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
agreements and which one's sending and
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
do a lot of analytical work to go is
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
this cost necessarily associated with
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
with this student and is the student
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
moving there so I just did a rough math
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
of what is the district spending on
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation first the students they
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
serve but it can get a lot more
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
complicated than that but for a ballpark
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
figure a thousand that's all I need is a
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
ballpark for special education
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um we talked a lot about how special edu
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
Education costs can vary one particular
 
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
particular student can have low needs
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
and or one particular student could have
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
high needs but on average the state
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
spend in District Public Schools is 27
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
000 per student okay
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
um as far as Local 27
 
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
000 27 000 per student in a sped student
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh I'd have to do some more math to say
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
how much of that is State money Federal
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
money or local money um I can I believe
 
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
I've done that analysis before I just
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the top of my head thank you
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
Marco follow-up to that um are you
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
including in the special it costs uh the
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
old cat Aid
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
yes this is the expenditure side not the
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
revenue side so it include
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes includes all expat expenditures
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
so even even sending to a placement so
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
then we're really putting the high-end
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
250 000 hour student into this average
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you for the questions
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Balboni
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and thank you Mark
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of talk about the
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
state funding formula the adequacy and
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
just for my own Clarity when I'm trying
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
to figure out is what is exactly the
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
difference between the amount of money
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
that would be given from the state to a
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
traditional uh Public School versus
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
so that is a lot of different ways to
 
01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
um so there's kind of a uniform
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
funding formula for each Charter that
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
uniform funding formula is the for
 
01:14:49.209 --> 01:14:49.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 it's going to be 3
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
866 dollars in base Aid a charter is
 
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
getting that base Aid also a district
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
school is getting that base Aid then we
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
have the differential Aid which is
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
additional add-ons if the student's fnr
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
sped ell third grade reading but just to
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
do apples to apples and it's hard to do
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
apples to apples when you're talking
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
about Charters and districts but to do
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
our best
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
um uh the base Aid is equivalent across
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
across uh in the funding formula for
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
both Charters and districts then
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
Charters have something called an
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
additional Grant which this legislation
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
is looking to amend the additional Grant
 
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:22.340 align:start position:0%
when you add on the additional grant for
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh Charters and fiscal year 24. if we
 
01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
talk about 23 it results in so base plus
 
01:15:32.169 --> 01:15:32.179 align:start position:0%
additional Grant it results in
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
7338 per student
 
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and for fiscal year 24 it's going to
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
be CPI adjusted seven thousand four
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars so seven thousand five
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars is kind of the not
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
dealing with demographic information
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
that is the base Aid and additional
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
grant for Charters now when we look at
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
districts it really depends on the
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
community so all districts are getting
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
base aid for educating students but some
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
districts have it gets very complicated
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
some districts have stabilization grants
 
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
some districts have relief Aid some
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
districts have extraordinary needs Grant
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
some districts have
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
additional select Revenue
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that goes above and beyond the cost
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education when you look
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
at the whole Statewide picture for all
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
districts on average the state aid per
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
pupil for all districts is around 6 000
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have the exact number but it's
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
around six thousand it's less than that
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
7 500 but it really varies so some
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
districts have
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
I think we could talk about Waterville
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
Valley uh I don't know what the number
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
of them yeah a really a large number 40
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
000 because their excess swap forty
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
thousand per pupil and some districts
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
are closer to that four thousand dollar
 
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
are closer to that four thousand dollar
number

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
follow up uh just a quick follow-up so
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
basically so the money from one student
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
in say my district is getting going to
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
the Traditional School that amount of
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
money isn't exactly the same if that
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
same student decided to go to Charter
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
School correct the state funding would
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
represent uh Myler thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
and thanks Mark for being here just a
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note it notes that this if
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
it were to pass was a 7.5 million
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
increase uh
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
what it doesn't deal with though is that
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
if within this year you have more
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are opened up which
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
is the goal of the Safe Water education
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
uh that figure then would be much higher
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
if in fact additional Charter Schools uh
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is the number used to get up with
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that to get this number is the first day
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
counts for the start of school year 23
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
so if in fiscal year 24 uh Charter
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment increases then this number
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
would increase
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.530 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
um public the district public Community
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
public schools are responsible for
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
providing transportation for Charter
 
01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.149 align:start position:0%
providing transportation for Charter
Schools

01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
um how much money do you think is on the
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
average that a district school I mean
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
that would be hard but let's say a place
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
like Manchester what do you think they
 
01:18:05.169 --> 01:18:05.179 align:start position:0%
they're putting forward for
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information but I can
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what the uh the
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
Department's position would be on if we
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
look at the Supreme Court decision on
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
which these adequacy funding formulas
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
were based if I remember correctly the
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
exact wording in the Supreme Court was
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
something the effect of the
 
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
the calculation will be based on funding
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
from both state and local monies
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
um so when we're looking at Charter
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
Public Schools that are being funded
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
currently just out of state funding and
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
then similarly with efas would it be the
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh opinion of the department that we are
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of that Supreme Court
 
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.610 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of that Supreme Court
decision

01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that there's no local
 
01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
money being mixed in with this it's only
 
01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
money being mixed in with this it's only
state

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that particular
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
question that particular
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional question involving
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
Charters coming up and so I'm I can only
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
rely on case law that's been codified so
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm also not a lawyer so I can't
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
really opine on that
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
um at all but I'm not aware of any case
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
law that really would help guide you in
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
the right direction into understanding
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
that whether there's a problem there or
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
not or legal risk or not thank you
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
Nazi thank you very much Mark have a

um I am a clinical uh social worker by
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
trade and I have been doing macro work
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
which is doing um designing programming
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
for young people and families for over a
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
decade now
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
I came up to New Hampshire uh to turn
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
around a charter school that I worked at
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
for three years and I'm currently now uh
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
working on starting a new Charter School
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
and we've talked a lot about uh numbers
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
but I did just kind of want to talk
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
about young people and families for a
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.729 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer any questions
afterwards

01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
I guess for you know just in sharing a
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
um I did not have a great High School
 
01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:00.620 align:start position:0%
experience I had experienced some trauma
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
and had no other option there was only
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
one game in town and that resulted in me
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
dropping out of high school
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately later on found out uh
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
found another uh program and uh became
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
the first in my family to graduate
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
college and then to go on and get a
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
master's degree so I just want to say
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
that um for me uh really again we've
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
talked about choice but I would just you
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
know put the idea out there that in a
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of places in our state
 
01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
you only have one option so if you've
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
been assaulted
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
um physically sexually
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
um if you have been bullied if you have
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
had a number of reasons which I was
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with with young people who were
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
coming to my school you are forced
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
to stay in that environment and if you
 
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:05.540 align:start position:0%
choose not to go
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
the state can be sent to your house to
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
force you to attend
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I just think that when we talk about
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
young people families we do talk a lot
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
about dollars but we don't talk about
 
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
those experiences that Force families to
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
look for another option or choice
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh the school that uh came up to turn
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
around I when I left we had a 54 of our
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
students uh where a special education
 
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.250 align:start position:0%
students uh where a special education
students

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
um and uh it was a very high number and
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
it was honestly because
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
we were able to support those young
 
01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:51.140 align:start position:0%
people and what happens is
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
more people start telling others that
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting the support that they
 
01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:56.420 align:start position:0%
need and they come
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'd also point out that in a lot of ways
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
you know we say public charter and uh
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
Public District school
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
but as a charter school
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
I had to accept students not only in my
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
district but I was sitting in but from
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
so in a lot of ways I feel that you know
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
we were actually opened uh to a lot more
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
young people and families I had young
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
people and families who drove for over
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to talk about my
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
experience with special education which
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
we've touched upon
 
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:40.930 align:start position:0%
we've touched upon
um

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
the resources are held at the district
 
01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.130 align:start position:0%
the resources are held at the district
level

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
which means that I had to advocate
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
each sending District
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
that each young person or family was
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
coming from and I will tell you that
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's no uh
 
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:02.780 align:start position:0%
you know a clear way it was a different
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
experience with every single district
 
01:24:05.699 --> 01:24:07.970 align:start position:0%
experience with every single district
and

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
I had to provide in the moment the
 
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
support and that those young people
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
needed because I couldn't say to them I
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
need to wait until this gets sorted out
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
with the district
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
so we had to provide that while also
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
managing that relationship with not just
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I also just wanted to talk a little
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
bit about the fact that district schools
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
also Bill Medicare
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole different Revenue
 
01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
Source in there as well so there's a lot
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
of funds that come into for young people
 
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:49.460 align:start position:0%
and families around special education
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the districts serve really as the
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
gate uh Keepers to be able to access
 
01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.169 align:start position:0%
gate uh Keepers to be able to access
those

01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
and with uh Transportation you know for
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
the rule of thumb is that if the Local
 
01:25:04.679 --> 01:25:05.770 align:start position:0%
the rule of thumb is that if the Local
District

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:05.780 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
provides transportation for young people
 
01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
and families then they do have to also
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
support charter schools in that
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation but if they do not
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
provide transportation for a lot of our
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
rural schools for example then they do
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
not have to pay or transport charter
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
school students my students used to walk
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
for miles to get to my school we have to
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
buy a bus because I was worried about
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
them working walking on a highway
 
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.810 align:start position:0%
them working walking on a highway
um

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
and you know so I think that um just
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
really being able uh to provide
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
um that support when even we think about
 
01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.590 align:start position:0%
um that support when even we think about
that

01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
the probably number one
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
um engagement into the Juvenile Justice
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
System comes from referrals from schools
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
we should really think about the other
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
impacts that not having an opportunity
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
to choose or another option how that
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
ripples across the community as well
 
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
ripples across the community as well

01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
charter school is now closed
 
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
um when I uh started with the school

that had 14 students when I left we were
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
up to 82 students
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
um it was a school that was really used
 
01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:49.580 align:start position:0%
as a last resort by a district
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
my students arrived at my doorstep as
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%

01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
down the district I had 20 freshmen for
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
the first time ever the school had
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
freshmen coming for around the support
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
rather than it being used as a last stop
 
01:27:19.570 --> 01:27:19.580 align:start position:0%
um yes so is your school part of a
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
Public School
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
program it was a sponsor it was
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
sponsored by a district but again it's
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
no longer in existence and where was
 
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
that in this thing uh it was based in
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
Pembroke thank you very much yeah
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%

01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
we will take a five minute break here
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
for committee members to stretch a
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
little bit and then we'll start up as
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for super simple reason for
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
why they close
 
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.050 align:start position:0%
why they close
yeah

01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:21.060 --> 01:40:27.550 align:start position:0%
yeah
foreign

01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead here and
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
start the next bill we're running really
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
late here but we have HB 578 up on the
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
docket establishing the position of
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
reporting administrator in the
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the sponsors plural are not here so
 
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
would you please introduce the bill
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
this is what we do when we have nobody
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
showing up so we we have it scheduled
 
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:00.980 align:start position:0%
the public does come for these things
 
01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
and that there's not a sponsor we
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
we make a sponsor represent cordelli
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh for the record state
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Glenn cordelli
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
representing Tuftonboro moultonborough
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
and Ossipee in the beautiful Lakes
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
Region and I would like to introduce
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
House Bill 578 established in the
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
position of a reporting administrator
 
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:32.780 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
this position
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
would be a typical employee position and
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
it would be involved in establishing
 
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:44.420 align:start position:0%
Implement policies and procedures
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
templates and other needs at the
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
department for reporting requirements
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we are all familiar with the
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements that we
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh mandate for the department
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
so that is an ongoing need at the
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
department and the reason for this
 
01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:07.739 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
so Caitlin are you going to be available
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
for us from the Department here at maybe
 
01:42:12.179 --> 01:42:13.129 align:start position:0%
for us from the Department here at maybe
to

01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Caitlin
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
Davis from the Department of Education I
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
feel like I might actually be the
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so representative moffatt kindly put
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
it in on my my behalf but him and I were
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
having a conversation and he was looking
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
for some data on some reports that had
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
passed over the last several years and
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
some requirements for the Department of
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
Education to collect and Report various
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
different information from school
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
districts and I said frankly I would
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
love to give you that information but
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
the department has not had the time to
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize that work over additional
 
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
work that the department has that either
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
has state or federal requirements that
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
are more important or have more
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
consequences than that specific report
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
him and I were having a conversation and
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
I kind of said well you know another rep
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
just asked for this report we're doing
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
this right now X Y and Z and so I asked
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
him I said you know know the department
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
is we really would like to comply with
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
these reporting requirements we
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of the legislation why
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's passed why you're looking for that
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
information why you want school
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
districts to do X Y and Z but we just
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity to really put
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
together some of the work required for
 
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:38.780 align:start position:0%
implementing some of these requirements
 
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
an example that a really tangible
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
example and a most probably the probably
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
the most fresh example in most people's
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
minds is sb420 so sb420 passed this past
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
summer and it started in the senate for
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary needs grants to provide
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
additional funding to school districts
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
that have a high proportion of free and
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch children to a low
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation so those grants
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
initially started going through the
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
Senate and then there was an amendment
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
to that bill to require the Department
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
of Education to collect an
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
accountability report from school
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
districts that receive this additional
 
01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.490 align:start position:0%
districts that receive this additional
Grant

01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
so that bill passed that way without
 
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
additional reporting requirement and if
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
the the way the grant works is that if
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
you don't receive or don't do that
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
report as a school district then you're
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
not eligible for those funds
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
so this was in the summer that it passed
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has to
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
um give estimates and school funding to
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
school districts a prior year so that
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
Grant wasn't even included that so there
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
was a lot of logistical
 
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
um work that we had to do explaining to
 
01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:48.659 align:start position:0%
school districts exactly how to take on
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
this additional money how to account for
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
the additional money we then needed to
 
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
develop templates notify schools how
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
much this new additional grant that they
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
were going to be receiving outside of
 
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
their typical budgeting process was how
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
to do the reports
 
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
um when to get the reports to US
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
we then had to work with schools to make
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
sure that they understood the template
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements the
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
consequences if they failed to produce
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
that report which is that they would now
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
if they failed to reproduce their report
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
and failed to opt out of the additional
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
funding um to the Department of
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
Education by early fall then they would
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
have a revenue shortfall and then
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
therefore not have enough money for the
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
school year that they had budgeted so
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of logistics that go
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
involved to go go that are involved with
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
doing this work I would say
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's all total the department has spent
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
since the since this bill passed this
 
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
past summer over a thousand staff hours
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
on this one requirement alone and those
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
the staff hours are not just one person
 
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
um those staff hours are I.T staff
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
pulling together the data that's
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
required for
 
01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
um the assessment information other I.T
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
staff that are required that are
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
required for the actual calculation of
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch per
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
um per equalized valuation there are
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
accountability administrators right now
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
that work with schools to help them
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
understand accountability and assessment
 
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
results and are doing the communication
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
about what the appropriate
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
terminology and documentation required
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
in the plan are we then have training
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
hours for school districts we develop
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
training documentation for school
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
districts we have office hours for
 
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
schools to call in and ask us questions
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
on undoing these reports
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
we then have Mark who was just
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
testifying on the charter school bill um
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
talking to the business officials in the
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
school about what the financial
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
implications are because those are
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
different than the performance
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
implications of the reporting
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
requirement and then we have me working
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
with superintendents mostly explaining
 
01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:44.420 align:start position:0%
them the requirements of the reports
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
working through
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
when we set our deadline for January 9th
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
to receive those reports calling schools
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
that said yeah you know you you missed
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
this so if you don't get it to us today
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to have a budget
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
shortfall this year and it's going to be
 
01:48:01.609 --> 01:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
problematic and
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
this is what we do in our typical
 
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:05.699 align:start position:0%
process for everything we're trying to
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're providing really
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
good customer service to the schools
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
especially since it's a new requirement
 
01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to make sure that they
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
have everything they need so that both
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
Us and Them can be successful so January
 
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
9th was our deadline for the report we
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
worked through a few late submissions
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the week last week we got all
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
of those in we do have one from every
 
01:48:27.010 --> 01:48:27.020 align:start position:0%
single School District
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
which is exciting for the department now
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in the process of
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
taking that information redacting what
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
is necessary if they're to make sure
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
that there's no personally identifiable
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
data that's used in those reports and
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have to publish those
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
reports so this is just one of many
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
reports that are on the books
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
um a couple additional other reports
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
that you'll see listed
 
01:48:51.229 --> 01:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
um in the bill is the gifted and
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
talented report that passed about a year
 
01:48:53.699 --> 01:48:54.890 align:start position:0%
talented report that passed about a year
ago

01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
um that was a representative moffett's
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
bill um that's why we're having this
 
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.410 align:start position:0%
bill um that's why we're having this
conversation

01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and I actually very recently said to
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
him we are working on that we did put
 
01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
out the initial data collection and and
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
whatnot from schools but we need to do
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up we need to kind of work with
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
schools to get the additional
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
information that we need to work on our
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
reporting methodology to get it out of
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
our systems and onto onto an appropriate
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
place that's visible for the public
 
01:49:22.129 --> 01:49:22.139 align:start position:0%
um but that there is no funding attached
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
to that bill school districts we're not
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
going to have issues with tax rates and
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
things like that if they didn't do that
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
so we chose to prioritize the other one
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
even though it passed more recently
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
because of the implications relative to
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
funding and tax rates
 
01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
um another bill that's in here and I had
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
a recent request from representative
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
Hobson who is not on education this year
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
but she she reached out and she was
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
looking for a bill relative to
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and third grade
 
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
reading and adequacy that's another
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
report that the department has just not
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
historically done because we just don't
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
have the staff capacity to do that
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
report and so we
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
um would always like to follow all of
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
the requirements in the law book I
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
actually have a bill in finance right
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
now talking about the law book and
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully recodifying those laws
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
um but it's just one of those things
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
that we are looking for an additional
 
01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.219 align:start position:0%
staff to really be able to focus on this
 
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
so we can ensure that we are really
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
complying with the laws that you have
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
written for the department and and
 
01:50:17.639 --> 01:50:18.410 align:start position:0%
written for the department and and
um

01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
and so we can give you the information
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for but also make
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
sure we're providing good customer
 
01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
service to the school districts when
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
they have to do this additional
 
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:29.030 align:start position:0%
they have to do this additional
reporting

01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn representative Rock dry thank
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
is this a full-time position this would
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
be a full-time position nice good
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up I asked this only because
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday we we saw a bill requiring
 
01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.970 align:start position:0%
yesterday we we saw a bill requiring
somebody

01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
making a position for data analysis and
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
and just and and discussion with schools
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
and taking training to schools and a lot
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
of that overlaps with what you were
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
talking about here and wondered if we
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
could combine something so it depends on
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
what you want so you're the legislature
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
is always trying to combine different
 
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's how we are how
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
we are here now they're saying oh well
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
you already have somebody that does
 
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
assessment or work and you already have
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
somebody that does Finance work and you
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
Caitlin are already already talking to
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
superintendents about other things
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
so we have enough reporting requirements
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
to occupy probably full-time three
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
full-time positions at least just in my
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
division and I'm not even talking about
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
the other divisions at the department
 
01:51:31.619 --> 01:51:33.229 align:start position:0%
the other divisions at the department
um so

01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:51:36.169 --> 01:51:36.179 align:start position:0%
then if the analysis and trading for
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
school districts is a priority that will
 
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
come after if you choose to combine the
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
two so we'll say all right let's look at
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements that have
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
financial implications we'll work on
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
that and then we'll get to the other
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
part so we likely wouldn't be able to
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
get to the the additional art so it's
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
just a we can pick and choose what the
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
priorities are and if you want the
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
department to do both we probably
 
01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
actually in fact need positions to do
 
01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.850 align:start position:0%
actually in fact need positions to do
both

01:51:58.850 --> 01:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
um the bill itself I mean it seems like
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably necessary
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
but there was one
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%
um item in your testimony that concerned
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
me just a bit and that was uh you had
 
01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
said that you failed to meet reporting
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
requirements for some of the things in
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
law you didn't have the obviously the
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
Manpower and whatnot but you said that
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
you would
 
01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:27.500 align:start position:0%
had to prioritize Federal requirements
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm wondering if it's the policy
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
of the department to prioritize Federal
 
01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
requirements or so it is not the for
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
Department the policy to prioritize
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements unless there's
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
federal grants that are dependent on it
 
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
so there's often times where a staff is
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
fully paid for the federal funding and
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
so it's not appropriate for that staff
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
person even though they might have the
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
expertise and knowledge to help with
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
some of the state reporting to
 
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
prioritize State work over Federal
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that's a requirement to
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
continue to participate in federal
 
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
grants so that's oftentimes when we're
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
talking about priority thank you
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Caitlin I have a question for
 
01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:11.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Caitlin I have a question for
you

01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:12.950 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm starting to believe that a lot of
 
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for this is on our
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
shoulders the legislature for asking we
 
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
want reports on policies for this to be
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
submitted to you whether it be gifted
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
talented or whether it be recording
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
policies in the classroom
 
01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:34.370 align:start position:0%
policies in the classroom
um

01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
my concern though is there is any is
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
there a need for
 
01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
more support
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
within the department for your present
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
staff and bureaus to accomplish the
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
mission and task that they have at them
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
for example like in in the Statewide
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
assessment is a mandate that comes down
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
as a result of Esser and as a result of
 
01:54:01.609 --> 01:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement we must do
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
increase three through and up not grade
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
11 as well
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
um it's it we need to be able to
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
interpret that stuff
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
so there's a rationale I I believe
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
are we then asking you to do some things
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
that are not related to your current
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities such as Gathering
 
01:54:21.119 --> 01:54:22.250 align:start position:0%
responsibilities such as Gathering
policy

01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:54:24.649 --> 01:54:24.659 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll leave it at that because
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other questions I have
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
which we'll get in with extraordinary
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
needs Grant when we talk about that
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
upcoming later this morning
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm not entirely I sure I understand
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
your question well we have
 
01:54:43.729 --> 01:54:43.739 align:start position:0%
is it a priority of the department that
 
01:54:46.570 --> 01:54:46.580 align:start position:0%
we be sending and forwarding to you
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
reporting policies regarding how we're
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
recording in the classrooms
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
how we're providing what we're doing
 
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
with gifted talented education are those
 
01:54:58.750 --> 01:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
priorities for you
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
so I would say if you pass the law then
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
it becomes a priority for the Department
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
because we really do want to implement
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
the laws okay see that's that's where we
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
always go and and it's you know to me
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
you know for you to do what you're
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
tasked to do by way of Statute right now
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.010 --> 01:55:21.020 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
Caitlin I won't Crush you anymore oh so
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm honestly I'm not familiar with that
 
01:55:27.590 --> 01:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill I haven't been tracking that bill
 
01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.609 --> 01:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Caitlin would it
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
help when we're passing a policy Bill
 
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
like the gifted and talented which I
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
think we were assured would be no work
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
for districts or for the Department
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
because it was just going to go in a
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
folder that anybody could look at
 
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
whenever they wanted to so it was
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be no work for anybody so if
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
when we were doing something like that
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
which we know is going to be work for
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
the school district and the department
 
01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
to put in the fiscal note that along
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
with that policy there will be support
 
01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.350 align:start position:0%
with that policy there will be support
provided

01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
monetarily for someone at the department
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it that would be
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful yes thank you further
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
oh no no thank you very much Mr chair uh
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
and a question to the chair were you
 
01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
just referring to House Bill 435 which
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
is the end of the day today
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to the the grant
 
01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
no I'm not referring to I'm not I'm not
 
01:56:35.570 --> 01:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
referring to the grants I know that for
 
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
example within 6 30 6 38 is one that I
 
01:56:42.050 --> 01:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
think that was addressed here a second
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
ago by Caitlyn dealing extraordinary
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
needs and the reporting which we part of
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
the issue I think what she's and I might
 
01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
be wrong but is the issue that we have
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
an accountability portion with it
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
written in that where in order to
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
receive it you've got to be accountable
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
for setting up a plan for using these
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and that is uh and we were
 
01:57:04.609 --> 01:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
cautioned during that hearing not to do
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
that uh we I made that comment I I
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
understand you made that comment uh so
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are and then I think
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
we're hearing something that we need to
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of that that staff at the
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
doe is not fully funded the way we think
 
01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:28.139 align:start position:0%
they are and in order to do this it's
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
going to take additional dollars and I I
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
think relative to your comment about
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
requirements from Essa versus state
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
requirements so there are certain times
 
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
where federal and state requirements are
 
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
aligned so assessment for account for
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
example the Assessments in three through
 
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
eight and eleven in math science reading
 
01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:48.410 align:start position:0%
eight and eleven in math science reading
and

01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
math science reading
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so those are state and federal
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
requirements so fortunately we are able
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
to use leverage the federal funds to
 
01:57:59.209 --> 01:57:59.219 align:start position:0%
really pay for the majority of that work
 
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
and so the staff that we are kind of
 
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
getting a two for one deal the staff are
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
paid out of the Federal grant but
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
they're able to comply with the state
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
reporting at the same time because it's
 
01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:10.139 align:start position:0%
exactly aligned but for example
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant is not aligned
 
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
there's no federal requirements that are
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
similar to this so we really can't use
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
those staff unless we have some sort of
 
01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
either a time and effort which we're
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
breaking down building their time for
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
the state funding and whatnot and even
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
at that we have to be cautious of Staff
 
01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:25.669 align:start position:0%
at that we have to be cautious of Staff
time

01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and I know you know some of you have
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
been to well I guess all of you have
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
been to the Department of Education but
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
some of you have had the pleasure of
 
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
working with many of my staff one-on-one
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education and
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
you're seeing a lot of them as we're
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
starting to go through this educate
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
through this kind of education session
 
01:58:39.599 --> 01:58:40.850 align:start position:0%
through this kind of education session
here

01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
um the staff want to do the best
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
possible job as they can they want to
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
comply with the laws that kind of
 
01:58:49.129 --> 01:58:49.139 align:start position:0%
dictate the work that they're supposed
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
to doing be doing in their job
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
descriptions but when you have too many
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
things it really worries a good
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
full-time employee because they're
 
01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
saying well I don't have the time to
 
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
focus on one specific thing and do a
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
good job of that and they don't
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to do a adequate job at
 
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and so in in especially in my
 
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
division under alternative you know
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the work that other divisions
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
are doing but
 
01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
for 420 for example it put a lot of work
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
on Mark this year at the exact same time
 
01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
that Mark is trying to set to to
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
calculate a billion dollars in adequacy
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
and set tax rates for every single town
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
so any time that he takes a second away
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
from that we could potentially make a
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
mistake calculating a tax rate and those
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
have implications for every taxpayer
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
across the state and so now either a
 
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
town has an issue and they have to do a
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
supplemental tax bow which that's not a
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
um or you know maybe they've raised too
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
much revenue and that it creates an
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
issue so it's just one of the things
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we really would like to focus and
 
01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
do a good job on our work but we're
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
getting spread too thin for the capacity
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
and the amount of work that has been
 
02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
added in the existing in the in in the
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
last several years so
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Myler
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
being here Caitlin as always
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
clarify for me please the difference
 
02:00:12.239 --> 02:00:14.109 align:start position:0%
clarify for me please the difference
between

02:00:14.109 --> 02:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
enacting a position in law
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis a budget request from the
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
Department for this position for example
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
and clarify that crosses so the majority
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
of it is timing
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and so the Department of Education is
 
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
always given targets for budgets that
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to so you historically
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
well sorry all agencies are given
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
targets for budgets so you'll say all
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
right your budget is 105 of last year
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
for example and this is just how State
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
budgeting works so you look at 105 and
 
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
you say all right well within my 105
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
percent I have to account for raises or
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
anything like that new hires you hired
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody this year who's on a family
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
plan who wasn't a who's the person
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't a family plan you have to account
 
02:01:04.609 --> 02:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
for those and so those kind of limit the
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
amount of new positions you're able to
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
request but additionally so for this one
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
specifically the Department of Education
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
timing line or Statewide administrative
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
service Services has a process where you
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
request new positions the Department of
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
Education had done all of our position
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
requests in April you didn't pass this
 
02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
bill until June and so it was too late
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
to request a new position for that and
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
we will continue to Advocate and we do
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
constantly advocate for new positions at
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education through our
 
02:01:32.209 --> 02:01:32.219 align:start position:0%
budget process but a lot of times just
 
02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:34.139 align:start position:0%
the timing doesn't line up and then
 
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's budget priorities don't
 
02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
line up to from the various different
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
steps from you know from the governor's
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
office to the house the Senate you know
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's positions that you know usually
 
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
it kind of you know there's 20 positions
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
on this 10 positions and there's five
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
positions and maybe two end up passing
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's kind of been my historical
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah experience that it just it goes
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
down so it we have a process we do
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
follow that process but it's it it
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily always line up with
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
the needs yes so if I may try to
 
02:02:08.209 --> 02:02:08.219 align:start position:0%
interpret what you just said that by
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
having a law passed creating a position
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
makes it then a priority ready to be
 
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
budgeted of which the department then
 
02:02:18.649 --> 02:02:18.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to fall within that 105
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
percent this is outside the the existing
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
budgeting process yes and especially
 
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
when it comes with appropriation thank
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
you very much further questions from the
 
02:02:30.250 --> 02:02:30.260 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you Caitlin
 
02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine that office space for
 
02:02:41.209 --> 02:02:41.219 align:start position:0%
more stuff would also be something we
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
might need to take into consideration I
 
02:02:43.139 --> 02:02:43.970 align:start position:0%
might need to take into consideration I
mean

02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
your the space you're using right now is
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
pretty nice but
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
I there's a limit I mean on how many
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
people you can put in the spot right
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely true oh space is a
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
concern um we are hoping to stay on 25
 
02:02:58.850 --> 02:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
Granite seat and there is sufficient
 
02:03:00.649 --> 02:03:00.659 align:start position:0%
space for the department needs right now
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
but I mean if we continue to grow I mean
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
that that same concern though is
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
relative to just all Department
 
02:03:07.199 --> 02:03:08.990 align:start position:0%
relative to just all Department
operations

02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:03:11.149 --> 02:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
um so if we get a new Federal grant for
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
example and we have three positions of
 
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
tied to that Federal grant then we need
 
02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:17.219 align:start position:0%
office space for them too so that's just
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
that is an ongoing kind of business
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
operations of the department
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
um but then when we're talking about
 
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
Federal needs and whatnot taking a
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
priority that's another good example is
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times we get all these new
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
federal grants and these federal grants
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
come with money and staff attached to
 
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
them and that's how we justify a
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
position and so then that's why the
 
02:03:34.729 --> 02:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
federal work then takes priority over
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
State work because we have a specific
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
position that's coming from that Grant
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
to to do the actual goals of that Grant
 
02:03:42.970 --> 02:03:42.980 align:start position:0%
and so if this were to be you know so
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
pretend extraordinary needs grants was a
 
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
federal Grant the Department of
 
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
Education would have written a plan
 
02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
saying this is what we're going to do we
 
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
need a position to do this work we need
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
an administrative set aside X Y and Z
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
and then we would have operated it that
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
way but this is a state program so now
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
this we're following the state process
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
for this one
 
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um and
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
I think well you know when we when we
 
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
get to the to the next bill we'll have
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
um you know opportunity I think for
 
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
robust discussion on on the
 
02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:15.179 align:start position:0%
accountability requirement behind the
 
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant but um but
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
just sort of you know leading up to uh
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
to that and I think tied in with the
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
with this request
 
02:04:23.639 --> 02:04:25.070 align:start position:0%
with this request
and

02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and it's
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
um sort of dual purpose of both
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
collection and Reporting because I think
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's an important element
 
02:04:37.250 --> 02:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
um of it that that you've spoken to and
 
02:04:41.209 --> 02:04:41.219 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that that uh uh outside of
 
02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
of this request it's consumed
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
approximately a thousand staff hours
 
02:04:49.550 --> 02:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
just on the Senate Bill 420 yes
 
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
um uh collecting and Reporting
 
02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
um you know piece of it so a thousand
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
Collective staff hours at doe is there
 
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense or what sense do you
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
have in terms of uh what impact that's
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
had on local school districts in terms
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
of the collective staff hours on putting
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
those reports together for the
 
02:05:13.629 --> 02:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
Department yes so
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
I have not spoken to schools to gauge
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
exactly how many hours that they've
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
spent on this but I mean similar types
 
02:05:22.689 --> 02:05:22.699 align:start position:0%
of hours I mean so school school
 
02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
districts have to one understand take
 
02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
some time to understand the implications
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
um so that oftentimes for this one
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
required their business administrators
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
looking at that saying should we go to
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
this should we not
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
um school districts that wanted to take
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
this money and use this money in their
 
02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
budget because it was received outside
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
of their regular budgeting process had
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
to do a special meeting so the costs
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
associated with doing a special meeting
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
and all of that time
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
superintendents or a lot of times
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum assessment administrators
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
were the ones that were preparing this
 
02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
plan so they were the ones that wrote
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
the plan and submitted to the Department
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
of Education attended the various
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
different trainings hosted by the
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so it definitely
 
02:06:06.410 --> 02:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
as expanded staff hours required by
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
School Districts as well fortunately it
 
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
does come with additional funding so the
 
02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
schools can take advantage of that in
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
the future but not when you're doing the
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
initial application part process
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for the
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions of the department yes
 
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.430 align:start position:0%
questions of the department yes
representana

02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
representana
 
02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:25.669 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
um is there any is it is it just
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
duplication uh to have listing out
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh the different reporting things that
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
are already listed in other rsas
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
um in this build is it necessary or
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
could it just be set to coordinate and
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
develop technical assistance uh to
 
02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
education yes that would be perfectly
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
fine I was trying to give the committee
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
some tangible examples especially when I
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
was speaking to representative Moffett
 
02:06:56.689 --> 02:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
because and those were ironically those
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
were all examples that I had been asked
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
for in the last like week-ish of when we
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
had had our conversation I believe that
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
was a few months ago
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
um yes you could definitely be more more
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
vague and that's kind of what we put
 
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
that other category on there because we
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
do want it to be others the only thing
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
is is I do know that those Grant those
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
reports are a specific priority so we do
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're doing
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
something to deal with that priority
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
not see any thank you very much thank
 
02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:30.830 align:start position:0%
not see any thank you very much thank
you

02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
okay we have no other cards on this
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill so we're closing this
 
02:07:38.109 --> 02:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
who's neutral
 
02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:43.550 align:start position:0%
who's neutral
yeah

02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
no if the the person introducing it has
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
to be pushed you know supporting the
 
02:07:50.810 --> 02:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill you can't hook up
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
with my question yes yes because he's
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
not one of the sponsors or anything yeah
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
but he's acting on behalf of
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
are they committed to interviews that
 
02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
bill so but you might put down a notes
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
that was introduced by a Committee
 
02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
Member who has not taken a position on
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
but technically when you introduce a
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
bill and you're interested because you
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.689 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:08:14.689 --> 02:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:08:14.699 --> 02:08:19.129 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.099 --> 02:08:56.169 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:08:56.169 --> 02:08:56.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.570 --> 02:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
yes do you support could you support
 
02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:06.910 align:start position:0%
yes do you support could you support
um yes

02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
a thousands
 
02:09:12.490 --> 02:09:12.500 align:start position:0%
and say he's working inside
 
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
I think we'll
 
02:09:26.450 --> 02:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
um proceed on to the next bill which is
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 638 relative to the
 
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need grants to schools and
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh call on our chairman representative
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
Ladd for Testimony thank you very much
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
Representative cordellia members of the
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Rick
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
Ladd I come from Haverhill New Hampshire
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
Grafton five I'm here today to introduce
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 638 this is relative to the
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grants to schools
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
last year through the Senate bill which
 
02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
came to US senator Hennessey was to
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that we had a bill for an
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant which was to
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
support those communities which had you
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
know need much like we've talked about
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
with equalized property valuations are
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
low and how can we assist when that bill
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
came to us it had approximately in it uh
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
15 to 17 million dollars we did have an
 
02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment which we put onto it dealing
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
with differentiated Aid in terms of a
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
special education assistance so it would
 
02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
have rounded out around 30 million
 
02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
dollars going down to districts
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that part was pulled out
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the extraordinary needs portion
 
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
passed this bill addresses the issue
 
02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:39.850 align:start position:0%
passed this bill addresses the issue
that

02:10:39.850 --> 02:10:39.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn has just discussed with you
 
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the accountability section and
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
this accountability was added into the
 
02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs as a result of some
 
02:10:54.649 --> 02:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
of the historical background we've had
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
when we've been dealing with new
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
components of differentiated Aid and one
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
of those components was put in during my
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
tenure here was the funding for the
 
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
remediation of a third grade student in
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
terms of language arts reading if in
 
02:11:14.050 --> 02:11:14.060 align:start position:0%
fact they were not receiving
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and the other three
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
categories which we have English
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
language learner special education and
 
02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:24.189 align:start position:0%
language learner special education and
and

02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
the um let's step fourth one here free
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
and reduced yes
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
so uh with that we had discussed earlier
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
with Finance many years ago how can we
 
02:11:39.649 --> 02:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
have some accountability that the money
 
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're putting in for this this 600 or so
 
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
back then now maybe a little higher than
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
that for the that fourth category
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
differentiated I spoke to dealing with
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
the English language arts remediation
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of results are we getting back
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
for what we're what we're putting money
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
in for how are we seeing any gains uh
 
02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
and growth well it's very difficult to
 
02:12:04.669 --> 02:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
see growth when you're seeing you're
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
funding and only at one time and you
 
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
can't see the results of that coming out
 
02:12:11.570 --> 02:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
of the third grade so I I believe within
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature there was a certain
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
level of frustration saying how do we
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
get accountabilities so that we know
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
that this money is being used a grant
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
you can put in requirements uh however
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
the way it's done uh the uh grant for
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
the uh English or for the remediation
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
into differentiated a it is not a grant
 
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
as part of adequacy so it can be used
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
that money can be used any way you want
 
02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
to use it within the school district
 
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of legislators
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
which were you know frustrated over that
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
are we using specifically to help the
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
remediation and what are we doing give
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
us some examples
 
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
um we didn't get that and that's right
 
02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
as I recall I presented this committee a
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
while back that there's the cohorts
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
remember how the grades were going and
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
we saw the waterfall effect in the
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
mathematics that was a result of back
 
02:13:04.490 --> 02:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
though in those days
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
so the concept was when we passed the
 
02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant we'll have
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
some accountability seeing this is not
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
part of differentiated this is on top of
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's a separate Grant and we'd like to
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
see how this money is being used now we
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
see that we have caused a problem from
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
the standpoint that we've caused all
 
02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
this that Caitlyn's just explained of
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
time and effort and now we're looking at
 
02:13:28.930 --> 02:13:28.940 align:start position:0%
additional Personnel to
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
provide us that data or information
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
where we're looking for in terms of all
 
02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
the the the recent reporting which we've
 
02:13:39.169 --> 02:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so this is puts us in that quandary
 
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
how do we get the results or the
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
information we need if the OE doesn't
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
have the staff to provide us that
 
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.550 align:start position:0%
have the staff to provide us that
information

02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's where we are with the
 
02:13:53.689 --> 02:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant I do concur at
 
02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
this point in time that is very little
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
sense for us asking for a district to
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
show us how they're using extraordinary
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
needs Grant if they're receiving two
 
02:14:03.850 --> 02:14:03.860 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year
 
02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
that that's true in many of our very
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
very small communities as you go up that
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
scale they receive more money
 
02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
um perhaps this was and I was probably
 
02:14:15.169 --> 02:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
remiss in saying I would like to see
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
some accountability but I was probably
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
remiss also at that time even asking for
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
the accountability so you can chuckle
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
that representative luno in terms of uh
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
this aspect of this extraordinary needs
 
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
Grant because I for one have always been
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
a pusher for fiscal capacity Aid and
 
02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
helping those districts which have the
 
02:14:36.609 --> 02:14:36.619 align:start position:0%
poverty within we need to do something
 
02:14:39.890 --> 02:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that was the wrong bill but
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get something passed to
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
get this money to the district so with
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
that you come out with all these add-ons
 
02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
to get things through and it's again one
 
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
of the things that had to be done I
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe to get the the end result of
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
getting the additional 17 million
 
02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:56.569 align:start position:0%
getting the additional 17 million
dollars

02:14:56.569 --> 02:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
so that concludes my testimony
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
I can't really answer a whole lot more
 
02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
other than what the Department's already
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
provide us I think we're going to be
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
very cautious and what we are doing in
 
02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
the future in terms of the issue that's
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
just been brought forward by Doe uh
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
resident of Lucas
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I remember we asked for
 
02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.330 align:start position:0%
um I remember we asked for
accountability

02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
don't remember exactly how it was worded
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
but looking at
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a two-pronged question
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
one is are they telling us how they
 
02:15:31.569 --> 02:15:31.579 align:start position:0%
spent the money
 
02:15:35.890 --> 02:15:35.900 align:start position:0%
and if not I'm noticing this is get
 
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
asking them to give a plan
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
but they don't it seems like they don't
 
02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
have to actually follow that plan and
 
02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:46.820 align:start position:0%
how do we know whether or not they did
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
where this all came from us back when we
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
were looking at the adequacy formula
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
back in 2008-9 which
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
um that's the the group that put that
 
02:16:01.129 --> 02:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
forward was Senator Estabrook she's no
 
02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
longer in the house honorable Estabrook
 
02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:07.619 align:start position:0%
we also had a component there where we
 
02:16:09.649 --> 02:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
were we if you look back in the old
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
statutes you'll see where money was to
 
02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
be used for certain areas of all those
 
02:16:18.890 --> 02:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
input areas in base adequacy there
 
02:16:20.930 --> 02:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't an accountability front plan that
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
was really presented to the department
 
02:16:26.209 --> 02:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
but it was basically advice that this is
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
how it should be used the money should
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
be used I think that's where we got that
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
same concept for what we did last year
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking at trying to find out how
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
this money is being used but I when
 
02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
Senator sbrook and Company were doing
 
02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
they were doing with much larger dollars
 
02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:43.939 align:start position:0%
than we're dealing now they're doing
 
02:16:46.250 --> 02:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
differentiated a which is huge dollars
 
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
compared to what we have for
 
02:16:49.969 --> 02:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary in each Grant and if you
 
02:16:51.709 --> 02:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
take out the extraordinary needs Grant
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet which we do have and start
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the districts there's many
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
districts which is receiving uh
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know less than fifty thousand
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's that's you know we're
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
asking for all the time and energy of
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the school department to
 
02:17:09.530 --> 02:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
put this together
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
I for one as a minister would probably
 
02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
blow it off
 
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
and and I see another head going up and
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
down over there because it's just not
 
02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
worth I don't have the staff to do it
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
there at the local level and and and if
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
I do have the staff the time I'm at the
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
additional time and costs don't equate
 
02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
to what I'm getting back from this grant
 
02:17:33.410 --> 02:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I think we've really got to really
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
look at this extraordinary Grant in
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
terms of what we're asking for the
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
concept is a good concept we need to get
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
money to districts now accountability
 
02:17:46.370 --> 02:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:17:50.570 --> 02:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cornell Thank you
 
02:17:52.849 --> 02:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is this
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
which which bill you talk about your
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
bill this bill right here
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be accountability
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
for those which are receiving additional
 
02:18:08.450 --> 02:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
dollars more than 50
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
000 so yes there there is if
 
02:18:14.810 --> 02:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
anytime you're going to have a grant of
 
02:18:16.310 --> 02:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
any kind though you're going to have to
 
02:18:18.049 --> 02:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
have staff Computing what District's
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
going to receive so it is going to cost
 
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
time but that's also why we have people
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
over there in finance at the Department
 
02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be looking at
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
modifying our formulas in any way and
 
02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:30.599 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of bills where we're
 
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
trying to jiggle those Mark's going to
 
02:18:34.969 --> 02:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
have to do some juggling around perhaps
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to change that for me a
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
little bit but that's expected that's
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
part of the job over there
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I I think the extraordinary needs
 
02:18:46.009 --> 02:18:46.019 align:start position:0%
Grant and if you look at all we've done
 
02:18:48.049 --> 02:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
from the original fiscal capacity
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and the concept which we
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
had for establishing policy poverty back
 
02:18:54.650 --> 02:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
in 2008
 
02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
we've gone now and we we've changed how
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
we provide support for the poor
 
02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
we provide support for the poor
districts

02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many times over the
 
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
last 10 years and with that every time
 
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
we make a tweak
 
02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and uh and
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Ladd
 
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
for uh for submitting this uh this
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
legislation I think this is basically
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is put together
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
by the department yeah yeah
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to I wanted to direct a
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
question particularly at um at at Part D
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
down at the down at the bottom and um
 
02:19:40.849 --> 02:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
and particularly how that can uh can
 
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
give school districts confidence in um
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
in in the report that they provide uh uh
 
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
and uh you know not interfering with the
 
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
grant award but basically providing some
 
02:19:56.690 --> 02:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
some heads up as to how districts um
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about unrestricted
 
02:19:59.389 --> 02:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
funding here correct and that's
 
02:20:00.889 --> 02:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
basically what we do with the other
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
monies which we provide through
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
education funding and I'm I'm closing on
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
that position right now that if we do
 
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
something like extraordinary needs Grant
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
based upon property values however we
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
may do a medium family income it should
 
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
be on unrestricted right right thank you
 
02:20:19.570 --> 02:20:19.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and and that this clarifies
 
02:20:21.889 --> 02:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
that's right so there are there are
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
there are some good points in this Bill
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
see none uh thank you representative
 
02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:39.290 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:43.610 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
does anyone need technical support on
 
02:20:50.770 --> 02:20:50.780 align:start position:0%
this bill from the Department
 
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
or did they
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
did the department want to uh testify to
 
02:21:00.170 --> 02:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
any anything that has been uh mentioned
 
02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
um we just have a little bit of data to
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
help explain what this bill is going to
 
02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
do so this bill is not eliminating
 
02:21:14.929 --> 02:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
um the extraordinary needs grants by any
 
02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
means and it's actually not going to
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
create any additional work for the
 
02:21:19.969 --> 02:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
Department it will limit some of the
 
02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
work the department is doing and some of
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the work that school districts are doing
 
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
because essentially this bill is just
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
putting a um a minimum requirement for
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs accountability
 
02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
plan in place for schools so school
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
districts with a small Grant will still
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
get that Grant but they won't have to
 
02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
spend a substantial amount of staff
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
hours working on that and the department
 
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
won't have to spend hours tracking down
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
a plan for maybe a 700 or 1500 Grant so
 
02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
Mark has some actual data as far as the
 
02:21:52.130 --> 02:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
number of schools that have submitted
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
plans and then the number of plans this
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
will eliminate
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
um just Market Magnolia Department of
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
Education uh just generally there's
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
about for fiscal year 24 I think 84 84
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
communities that need to do a plan and
 
02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
then this will bring it down to 35 so if
 
02:22:12.889 --> 02:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
um you know plans under 50 000 so these
 
02:22:14.690 --> 02:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
would just be plans over 50 000 where
 
02:22:16.849 --> 02:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
they can look at that growth data look
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
at that outcome data and submit it to
 
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
the department as required by law by the
 
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
existing RSA not what this bill does
 
02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:26.150 align:start position:0%
existing RSA not what this bill does
um

02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing just to go through the
 
02:22:29.450 --> 02:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
bill a little bit a lot of it's just
 
02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
sort of codifying we had when this law
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
passed this summer
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
um it was in effect for fiscal year 23
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
so we had to implement it pretty quickly
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
and so we had to come up with sort of
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
some policies and some understandings of
 
02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
how to interpret the bill
 
02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
um that summer and we had to communicate
 
02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
that to the district so a lot of what
 
02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
this is doing is just codifying our
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
existing understanding
 
02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:48.889 align:start position:0%
existing understanding
um

02:22:48.889 --> 02:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
um if you were not to pass this some of
 
02:22:51.889 --> 02:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
the stuff would still hold true so it
 
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
would still hold true that all adequacy
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
is unrestricted even though it's
 
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
conditional on completing an
 
02:22:57.710 --> 02:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
accountability plan it's still
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Aid and that was I spent
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
hours talking to districts about that
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
because they they are used to receiving
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
grants federal grants which are highly
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
restricted and there's a highly
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
restrictive process in which to submit
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
funds and receive that that is not how
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy works and I think this is a
 
02:23:13.849 --> 02:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
concept that a lot of districts didn't
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
really understand is that adequacy
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
essentially underwrites your local
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
budget it it financially supports
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you're going to choose to do as
 
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
a community it underwrites it in every
 
02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
single attitude adequacy dollar goes
 
02:23:27.290 --> 02:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
against the tax rate so if that if
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's any error in any adequacy dollar
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
you are anticipating and setting the tax
 
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
rate that automatically creates a budget
 
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:35.090 align:start position:0%
rate that automatically creates a budget
problem

02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of districts had to be had I
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
had to walk them through that and how
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy impacts the tax rate and so it
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
they were treating it like a traditional
 
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
Federal Grant and that was one of the
 
02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
struggles so a lot of this is going to
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
clarify this so I can point to a
 
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
district that's confused and say look at
 
02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
this bill look what this bill's telling
 
02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:52.130 align:start position:0%
this bill look what this bill's telling
you

02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:23:54.770 --> 02:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
um it will hopefully make the TA a
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.410 --> 02:24:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
further comments from the Department
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
um we're getting on where we are now 577
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
we're right on time
 
02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
let's sleep you're going to make all
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
these things just unrestricted and be
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.050 --> 02:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna close in on the last
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill we have this morning that's 577.

02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
this morning I will do my best and take
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
it from there
 
02:25:55.439 --> 02:25:56.210 align:start position:0%
it from there
um

02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:59.090 --> 02:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
it is as stated it changes the limit for
 
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
school district liability for special
 
02:26:02.929 --> 02:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
education costs reducing it from three
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
and a half times the state average to
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
one and a half times
 
02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:08.150 align:start position:0%
one and a half times
um

02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
clearly the intent of this is to provide
 
02:26:13.849 --> 02:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
more State funding for special education
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is prorated to districts if not
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
enough funding is appropriated
 
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
as has been the case for many years that
 
02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
there's not enough special education
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
funding in the state budget
 
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.110 align:start position:0%
funding in the state budget
uh

02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
there is an additional proposed 250 000
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
for special education funding in
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
communities of less than 1 000 students
 
02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
and last night I said well how many
 
02:26:47.809 --> 02:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
communities are there with less than 1
 
02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
000 students there's 58 I mean I'm sorry
 
02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
less than 1 000 residents I misspoke
 
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
there are 58 New Hampshire communities
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
that small
 
02:27:01.250 --> 02:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
the special education amount has been
 
02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
the same since 20 since 2007.
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
clearly nothing else is the same in
 
02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
clearly nothing else is the same in
costs

02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:11.389 align:start position:0%
costs
so

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:13.610 --> 02:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
I think I would just say special
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
education is extremely important the
 
02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
cost to small communities of one or a
 
02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:22.190 align:start position:0%
cost to small communities of one or a
few

02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
few
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
higher cost special education
 
02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:27.950 align:start position:0%
higher cost special education
programs

02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
breaks the back of little districts I'll
 
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
use my own town of Corydon as an example
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
we are less than 800 people 650 or so
 
02:27:38.270 --> 02:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
registered voters
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a cater for school and then tuition
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
our students to a variety of other
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
schools through a school choice program
 
02:27:46.849 --> 02:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
the total number of students being
 
02:27:49.490 --> 02:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
educated by Croydon is less than 80 in
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
one student
 
02:27:57.290 --> 02:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
are in our total school budget you guys
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
are going to chuckle is a 1.7 million
 
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
dollars including the tuition for fifth
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
through 12th graders
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
one special ed student can alter that
 
02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
one special ed student can alter that
budget

02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
in a very very significant way and the
 
02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
state is not doing its share
 
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Damon
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
um there are there questions for
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Damon now understanding
 
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we will be discussing this in exact
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
session and the department is here and
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
she's standing in
 
02:28:32.809 --> 02:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor so we'll stay out
 
02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the technical questions please
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
clarify because your testimony was was
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
more to the effect of of single or small
 
02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
numbers of students catastrophically
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
affecting budgets
 
02:28:53.170 --> 02:28:53.180 align:start position:0%
but isn't this bill more in attuned to
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
the more the the smaller increases and
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
larger number of students because
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
02:29:05.210 --> 02:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
the current uh law the state is picking
 
02:29:07.309 --> 02:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
up the overwhelming majority of the cost
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
for those catastrophic is that am I
 
02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
I don't specifically know the answer in
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
terms of what amount of the catastrophic
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
costs the state picks up I know it's
 
02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:20.690 align:start position:0%
costs the state picks up I know it's
significant

02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't only address that I was
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
just highlighting that part of the bill
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
the primary feature of the bill is the
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
changing the limit for school district
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
liability from three and a half times
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
down to one and a half
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and for clarification purposes
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
now if you take the average cost let's
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
say twenty thousand for an easy figure
 
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
three and a half times the district has
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
to cough up seventy thousand dollars
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
before they're going to get state aid
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
then up to 10 times otherwise the the
 
02:29:55.730 --> 02:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
that per pupil cost the state will kick
 
02:29:57.650 --> 02:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
in 80 percent of that difference right
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
there so again the local district has 20
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
percent they're added on to the seventy
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars then you get above that
 
02:30:08.929 --> 02:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
ten times and if that difference is paid
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
up fully by the state
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
so if you have a 250 000 cost associated
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
with a youngster
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to be paying locally
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
part of that but not all that 250 000
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
02:30:26.570 --> 02:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
and we have Finance here too and they
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
could also explain that a little bit
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
more if we don't get it but this is a
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
huge issue we did have a bill here
 
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
in recent years where we had dropped
 
02:30:41.090 --> 02:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
that to two and a half times
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
if you recall that bill and that also it
 
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
was a similar concept to this one which
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
is dropping to one and a half times
 
02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much representative
 
02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:52.250 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much representative
Damon

02:30:52.250 --> 02:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:56.450 --> 02:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
that Mike's giving us a little bit of
 
02:30:59.210 --> 02:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
problem so we'll at noon time we're
 
02:31:01.309 --> 02:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
going to have them look at that so we
 
02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
have one card here that's been similar
 
02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:07.730 align:start position:0%
have one card here that's been similar
oh

02:31:07.730 --> 02:31:07.740 align:start position:0%

I mean we want to
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%

02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
already gotten an email and some
 
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
information on an organization excuse me
 
02:32:37.610 --> 02:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
Eric yes Jen will you please contact
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
Tech and tell him
 
02:32:59.570 --> 02:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
it it might be if if that's taken off
 
02:33:06.889 --> 02:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
don't don't disconnect don't you see
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
this is a daisy chain
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
one element out we lose the whole thing
 
02:33:12.479 --> 02:33:18.830 align:start position:0%
one element out we lose the whole thing
yeah

02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:22.250 --> 02:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
can can if Eric talks loudly
 
02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
hey Anglo is here if Eric talks loudly
 
02:33:28.010 --> 02:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
can everybody hear him that's what we're
 
02:33:29.210 --> 02:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
going to do Eric why don't you just
 
02:33:34.130 --> 02:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:36.290 --> 02:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I also served in the military
 
02:33:39.130 --> 02:33:39.140 align:start position:0%
for 30 years there you go
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
that retired about 40 years ago so let's
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
start using maternal voice
 
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
um anyway I also served uh being an spga
 
02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
we have the most all the members are
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
either current or former school board
 
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
members of budget committee members I
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
myself served on the tallest Brookline
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school board for three years
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
and I also have served as a special
 
02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
education advocate so I have a lot of
 
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
background in special education and the
 
02:34:07.969 --> 02:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
thing that frustrates me both as a
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
citizen and as a school board member was
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
that the amount of
 
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
this unfunded mandate that comes down
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
02:34:18.170 --> 02:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
special education is important it's
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
needed for students students need this
 
02:34:21.770 --> 02:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
to succeed in life and there's many
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
stories about women they do succeed when
 
02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
they get the special education but it is
 
02:34:29.630 --> 02:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
a refreshing blow to the taxpayer
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
especially in small towns but even in
 
02:34:34.010 --> 02:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
large counties when you look at what
 
02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
goes into the budget for special
 
02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.309 align:start position:0%
goes into the budget for special
education

02:34:37.309 --> 02:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's really not negotiable it's in your
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
operating budget in a Traditional School
 
02:34:44.570 --> 02:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
District and it's in your default budget
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
in an sb2 School District
 
02:34:50.270 --> 02:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
and so what can be done to help the
 
02:34:53.929 --> 02:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
towns now there is some heat here and as
 
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
a chairman Ladd has mentioned right now
 
02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
when you get you have to go to three and
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
a half times the average State
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
expenditure for students before any Aid
 
02:35:05.570 --> 02:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
kicks in and at that point it kicks in
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
at the 80 20 low
 
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
um so that the
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
um the district is responsible for 20
 
02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:13.610 align:start position:0%
um the district is responsible for 20
percent

02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:35:16.490 --> 02:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
above that three and a half level and
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
and then this the state will pick up 80
 
02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
and then if you get up to 10x the level
 
02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
which is the current level that's when
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
the state picks a pole but you're
 
02:35:28.250 --> 02:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
talking if you get an average number of
 
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.530 --> 02:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
is it working yeah article 28a talks
 
02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
about unfunded mandates and this really
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
is an unfunded mandate and it still will
 
02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
be even after this bill but it will be
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
less of a unfunded mandate so that's why
 
02:36:11.090 --> 02:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
I think this is important to look at and
 
02:36:13.370 --> 02:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
to pass to help our school districts
 
02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
across the state because special
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
education is something that's been
 
02:36:18.650 --> 02:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
dictated to us it's something that needs
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
to be done first for for our special
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
education students and that population
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
has grown if you look at recent numbers
 
02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
it varies but it's anywhere between 15
 
02:36:29.929 --> 02:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
and 20 percent of our students are
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
either on an IEP individual education
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
plan or a 504 plan and so it's not a
 
02:36:41.450 --> 02:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
small cost and it is really making it
 
02:36:43.010 --> 02:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
very difficult for our taxpayers
 
02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to do the right thing
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
but the state needs to kick in their
 
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
their fair share and reducing this level
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
to three from three and a half percent
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
to one and a half percent where the 80
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
20 kicks in is about very much needed
 
02:36:59.090 --> 02:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
change and it's a bipartisan change I'm
 
02:37:01.370 --> 02:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
a republican I know it's a Democrat bill
 
02:37:02.929 --> 02:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
but you know this is the right thing to
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
do so I hope that this committee
 
02:37:08.330 --> 02:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
recommends ought to pass you may also
 
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
want to consider an executive committee
 
02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
before this I know there were some of
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
the proposals some other lsrs that were
 
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
put forward that of course Consolidated
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
there was one to look at that 10x number
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
that might want to come down to 5x for
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
example so that may be something the
 
02:37:24.889 --> 02:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
committee considers because that would
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
be in the same Spirit to help these tax
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers especially in these small
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
towns you look at a town like Croydon
 
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
like the previous speaker talked about
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
they get a 200 000 hit on a 1.7 million
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
dollar budget that's really substantial
 
02:37:40.969 --> 02:37:40.979 align:start position:0%
so you really want to look at that and
 
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I hope that you you do ought to pass
 
02:37:45.610 --> 02:37:45.620 align:start position:0%
and then also check out
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
sdganh.org for more on our rationale and
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
all bills including this one
 
02:37:54.370 --> 02:37:54.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.439 --> 02:38:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
animation

02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
we also have more students qualify for
 
02:38:43.250 --> 02:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
this going to one and a half past the
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
department done any kind of leadership
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
from Becky of you uh as far as the
 
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.389 align:start position:0%
from Becky of you uh as far as the
youngsters

02:38:49.389 --> 02:38:49.399 align:start position:0%
youngsters
 
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive this program so the
 
02:38:54.770 --> 02:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have data on those
 
02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
kids because we wouldn't be able to do
 
02:38:58.849 --> 02:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
it unless we were able to collect the
 
02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
financial impacts for those students
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
however so right now at three and a half
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
times last year there were 760 kids that
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
were eligible so the current cap is and
 
02:39:14.270 --> 02:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
I was just looking at data this is 67
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
000 and it would drop down to about 30
 
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
000 at one and a half times
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
um now I do want to just remind the
 
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
community these are special education
 
02:39:23.389 --> 02:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
costs alone so
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe I I missed Becky's
 
02:39:28.370 --> 02:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
presentation to you all at the
 
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
department last week
 
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
um but why I don't know if she kind of
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
walked through the formula but the way
 
02:39:35.809 --> 02:39:35.819 align:start position:0%
it works is the department collects the
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
data on these students all of the costs
 
02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
associated with the students in their
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
IEPs and reviews all of that detail
 
02:39:44.990 --> 02:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's a cap that's set in law which is
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
three and a half times right now
 
02:39:49.130 --> 02:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
um so we find out all of the costs that
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
exceed that three and a half times and
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
then we take that amount and we multiply
 
02:39:55.969 --> 02:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
it by eighty percent which is the amount
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
the department will reimburse so the
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
amount over that three and a half times
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
so any costs over sixty thousand right
 
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
now we will reimburse at 80 percent
 
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
now in past years and in this year
 
02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:10.670 align:start position:0%
now in past years and in this year
included

02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:40:13.010 --> 02:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education then will
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
prorate the payment based on available
 
02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:18.050 align:start position:0%
prorate the payment based on available
appropriation

02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so in the past that 80 percent is
 
02:40:23.690 --> 02:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes multiplied by 70 percent last
 
02:40:26.210 --> 02:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
year everybody received 100 of that 80
 
02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
because we had substance enough
 
02:40:31.309 --> 02:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the state budget this
 
02:40:31.319 --> 02:40:32.030 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the state budget this
year

02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
um we didn't have quite enough or maybe
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
our total obligation was 34 million and
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
um our appropriation was say 33 million
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
making some numbers up there so we
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
prorated the 80 at 90 something percent
 
02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
98 so so
 
02:40:50.929 --> 02:40:50.939 align:start position:0%
um what this would do is a bunch more
 
02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
kids would be eligible for Aid
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so I think is is there's a confusion
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the existing kids would we would
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
just be instead of paying everything
 
02:41:02.929 --> 02:41:02.939 align:start position:0%
above 60 000 we would just start paying
 
02:41:05.809 --> 02:41:05.819 align:start position:0%
everything above 30 000 that is true for
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
those kids but this would add additional
 
02:41:09.050 --> 02:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
kids into the pool that would be
 
02:41:10.849 --> 02:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
eligible for funding
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
um so there's two different things so
 
02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't come with
 
02:41:16.130 --> 02:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
appropriation right now so if you were
 
02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
to just change it to one and a half
 
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
times what that would do is the
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
department would continue on collect
 
02:41:24.410 --> 02:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
that additional data on those students
 
02:41:26.090 --> 02:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
calculate what the payment would be for
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
those students however our payment would
 
02:41:31.490 --> 02:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
be substantially prorated probably I
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't even know twenty percent I'm just
 
02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:34.730 align:start position:0%
don't even know twenty percent I'm just
guessing

02:41:34.730 --> 02:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
um or the legislature could
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
simultaneously add additional
 
02:41:39.770 --> 02:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the Department of
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
education's budget to pay for those
 
02:41:48.730 --> 02:41:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
the department has no information that
 
02:41:55.790 --> 02:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
we can really Target well the only one
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the only time we're ever collecting
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
financial information to a specific
 
02:42:02.809 --> 02:42:02.819 align:start position:0%
student are for kids that are eligible
 
02:42:04.969 --> 02:42:04.979 align:start position:0%
for catastrophic State special education
 
02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
Aid right now it used to be called
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid and I always slept but
 
02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
State special education Aid um is is for
 
02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
those kids right now so
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
um the department begins collecting that
 
02:42:18.290 --> 02:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
information in the summer of every
 
02:42:19.969 --> 02:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
single year so the department gets all
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
the files from the school districts We
 
02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
compare it to a copy of the student's
 
02:42:25.250 --> 02:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
IEP to make sure those services are in
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
the IEP and appropriate
 
02:42:30.410 --> 02:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and then we do the calculation in the
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the fall when we're reviewing all of
 
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
those transactions and whatnot so it
 
02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
would just the file that now includes
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
760 students might now include several
 
02:42:41.210 --> 02:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
thousand students
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:42:45.469 --> 02:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you very much Caitlin and Becky and Mark
 
02:42:49.969 --> 02:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
for joining us on on this
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
um I recall the the prorated section for
 
02:42:54.170 --> 02:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
special education Aid because we've
 
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it before but where
 
02:42:58.130 --> 02:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
in the statute is that right now um I
 
02:43:00.889 --> 02:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
believe it's a 186
 
02:43:00.899 --> 02:43:03.830 align:start position:0%
believe it's a 186
something

02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
that sounds right and
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
um there's a this bill only has a few
 
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
Roman numerals on it there's a lot of
 
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
Roman numerals in that in that section
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I can find you the exact area I'm
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
just not an expert this is not no no
 
02:43:20.809 --> 02:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's okay because I think that's a
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
you've raised a significant point on
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
this and it could also be a budget
 
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
footnote so I'm not 100 sure off the top
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
of my head I'm sure Mark is looking for
 
02:43:34.990 --> 02:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:37.809 --> 02:43:37.819 align:start position:0%
you're gonna need more than 22 million
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
I will say that District districts could
 
02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
probably tell you to some extent an idea
 
02:43:47.210 --> 02:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
of how many students would meet that cap
 
02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
because districts are tracking that for
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
lots of different reasons at an
 
02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
individual student level sometimes for
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement for Medicaid to
 
02:43:57.650 --> 02:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
schools sometimes to see if students
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
will meet the cap for special education
 
02:44:01.309 --> 02:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
Aid because sometimes you don't know for
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
sure if a student is going to meet the
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
cap so there's
 
02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
um bookkeeping that's done at the local
 
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
level to ensure that those IEPs are
 
02:44:11.450 --> 02:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
being tracked in those services and
 
02:44:12.889 --> 02:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
things like that are being inputted into
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
the system because what you don't want
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
to do at the district level is wait
 
02:44:19.730 --> 02:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
until June to start inputting your data
 
02:44:23.270 --> 02:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
for the July 1 collection for special at
 
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
a because it's a it's a Time intensive
 
02:44:28.610 --> 02:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
process because you're accounting for
 
02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
every student's every sessions service
 
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
for the entire School duration of that
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
IEP so districts could probably give you
 
02:44:39.290 --> 02:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
an i idea of how many students they
 
02:44:41.270 --> 02:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
think could potentially reach the cap if
 
02:44:43.090 --> 02:44:43.100 align:start position:0%
that was something that you wanted
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
closer to hard data on
 
02:44:48.889 --> 02:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
okay Rick and a fault Mr chair follow-up
 
02:44:50.809 --> 02:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
sure on that and the Paul actually
 
02:44:52.370 --> 02:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
follow-ups too
 
02:44:54.410 --> 02:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
um before this committee acts on the
 
02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay yeah because I think this goes
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
beyond I mean this is policy but also
 
02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:07.870 align:start position:0%
beyond I mean this is policy but also
fiscal

02:45:07.870 --> 02:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
I guess it comes down with me that it's
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
a huge unfunded mandate
 
02:45:20.270 --> 02:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
and probably the largest one we've got
 
02:45:22.690 --> 02:45:22.700 align:start position:0%
in education here is
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard from many school districts
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
not just in this state but all over the
 
02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
country that we're having to borrow from
 
02:45:32.809 --> 02:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
other areas of our operational budget to
 
02:45:35.230 --> 02:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
pay for the cost of this type of service
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
and for the small towns like a Paramount
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
they see a two Cathy kids in one year a
 
02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
school district has 67 kids
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
they just didn't have the money
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so what do you have to do take that
 
02:45:53.450 --> 02:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
tax anticipation note out or become
 
02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with essay don't you have
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
an emergency department some kind of
 
02:45:58.969 --> 02:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
help us out with that now uh districts
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
freeze their budgets
 
02:46:02.330 --> 02:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
districts have to freeze their budgets I
 
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
mean that's the reality and even with
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
the way the current system works this
 
02:46:08.090 --> 02:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
money is reimbursed to the district so
 
02:46:10.969 --> 02:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
the district is not getting the money so
 
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to find the money
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the moment they're still have to you
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
know somehow absorb those costs in the
 
02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
moment and then retroactively ask for
 
02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement at whatever rate the
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
department is able to reimburse it based
 
02:46:25.490 --> 02:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
on what allocation they have set aside
 
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
for that so that that this won't change
 
02:46:30.290 --> 02:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
that process I don't believe based on
 
02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
the way that it's written now so it
 
02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
still will have the same impact in that
 
02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:38.710 align:start position:0%
still will have the same impact in that
way

02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you both
 
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if either of you
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
might know uh several years ago we
 
02:46:49.250 --> 02:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
passed a bill related to
 
02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
um uh districts forming associations for
 
02:46:54.889 --> 02:46:54.899 align:start position:0%
the basis of risk pools uh do you know
 
02:46:57.050 --> 02:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
if any districts have formed such
 
02:46:57.060 --> 02:47:00.469 align:start position:0%
if any districts have formed such
associations

02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
specific information I can share but I
 
02:47:03.889 --> 02:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
would imagine Becky Fredette will be
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
able to provide that information to you
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm not aware of any I mean no I
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody's joined a risk pool
 
02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:12.650 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody's joined a risk pool
it's

02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
and it's a great idea it came from the
 
02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:15.770 align:start position:0%
and it's a great idea it came from the
Midwest

02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
Midwest
 
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
didn't it Kansas yeah
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
I think representative miler
 
02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh could you tell us
 
02:47:29.210 --> 02:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
does a reimbursement take place in other
 
02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:30.170 align:start position:0%
does a reimbursement take place in other
words

02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
words
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a cost that takes
 
02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
place and they have to pay that when
 
02:47:36.050 --> 02:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
does the reimbursement actually receive
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the school district on January 1st
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
of each year sometimes like December
 
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
28th the Department's really good but
 
02:47:45.170 --> 02:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
usually January 1st of each year it has
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
to be in by the end of July I'm sorry
 
02:47:48.650 --> 02:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
the input of the data at the district
 
02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
level they have the month of July to
 
02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
input the data for the students that
 
02:47:54.410 --> 02:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
they believe are going to meet the cab
 
02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
but it's an extensive process on the
 
02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
department side then to cross-reference
 
02:48:01.130 --> 02:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
every session that is inputted for each
 
02:48:02.330 --> 02:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
student for example if you have a
 
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
student who gets is in an out of
 
02:48:06.530 --> 02:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
District placement but also gets
 
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy speech and behavior
 
02:48:11.450 --> 02:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
therapy for example the person who's
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for accounting for that at
 
02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
the district level has to input every
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
single session of OT every single
 
02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
session of speech every single session
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
of behavioral therapy they have to
 
02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
calculate the rate outside of the
 
02:48:26.530 --> 02:48:26.540 align:start position:0%
tuition perhaps for that out of District
 
02:48:28.849 --> 02:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
placement all those things are accounted
 
02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
for separately for each student in so it
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
takes a good amount of time so then the
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
department has to go cross-reference and
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
make sure the students were there that
 
02:48:40.490 --> 02:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
day that there's no attendance issues
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
that what is in the student's IEP
 
02:48:44.330 --> 02:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
matches what was inputted for the amount
 
02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
of minutes that you're asking for the
 
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for and then calculating
 
02:48:49.790 --> 02:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
all that to come up with what the total
 
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
cost is and then going back to the
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
district to resolve any errors and
 
02:48:55.490 --> 02:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
figure out what the errors are and then
 
02:48:57.050 --> 02:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's why it takes till January to get
 
02:48:58.490 --> 02:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement of the following year
 
02:48:59.929 --> 02:48:59.939 align:start position:0%
because Victor you need to give us the
 
02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
cliff notes it's extensive I mean I will
 
02:49:03.770 --> 02:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
tell you a special ed administrative
 
02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
assistant at the district level
 
02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
um this is an enormous part of their job
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
and for some District level directors
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
who don't have admin support they're
 
02:49:14.750 --> 02:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
doing this so take me through this
 
02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
situation I spoke about Piermont the
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
kids come in in November yeah two kids
 
02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay tell me how they're going to pay
 
02:49:23.090 --> 02:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:49:25.250 --> 02:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
well do they have a special end I'll
 
02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
call it trust they don't have any kind
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
of fun and no fun there
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to freeze your budget first
 
02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
well I'm again I'm not the
 
02:49:33.889 --> 02:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
superintendent there so I certainly
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak on behalf of what I
 
02:49:37.490 --> 02:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
what they would do but in a district
 
02:49:39.770 --> 02:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
where I've worked in the past the
 
02:49:41.270 --> 02:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
special ed director or whoever is
 
02:49:42.889 --> 02:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
responsible for that would meet with the
 
02:49:44.450 --> 02:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the business
 
02:49:46.849 --> 02:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
administrator to talk about what is the
 
02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
current state of their budget what do
 
02:49:50.270 --> 02:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
they have in operating costs that have
 
02:49:52.370 --> 02:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
not been expended
 
02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
um how can they cover the cost if they
 
02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
freeze the budget completely what costs
 
02:49:59.809 --> 02:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
can they not take from you know salary
 
02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
things like that Personnel what other
 
02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
special ed costs can they not freeze
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
because you're responsible for paying
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
for that but that's where
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of times that causes this
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
community Discord
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
um that I think Mr power was talking
 
02:50:15.710 --> 02:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
about previously which is that you are
 
02:50:17.690 --> 02:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
freezing your budget at the district
 
02:50:19.929 --> 02:50:19.939 align:start position:0%
level to cover these unanticipated
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
expenses because you're required to do
 
02:50:26.330 --> 02:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
so and at what cost to the rest of your
 
02:50:27.950 --> 02:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
school community and it'll cost to the
 
02:50:29.929 --> 02:50:29.939 align:start position:0%
your entire Community if you don't have
 
02:50:32.210 --> 02:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
enough money to cover the placements for
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
example and the district has to work to
 
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
try to keep those students in those
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
placements because that is what the IEP
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
team has determined is most appropriate
 
02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
you might have to go back to the voters
 
02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
and ask for a special meeting and come
 
02:50:46.370 --> 02:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
up with the money some other way or
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
you're freezing your budget so all those
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
things that you have set aside money for
 
02:50:51.770 --> 02:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
are encumbered money for then that no
 
02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
longer becomes an option thank you
 
02:50:56.030 --> 02:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome represent Belcher
 
02:50:59.270 --> 02:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so looking at the way
 
02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
that this bill operates I have a little
 
02:51:03.050 --> 02:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
bit of concern that it might actually
 
02:51:04.910 --> 02:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
wind up hurting some of the people it's
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
designed to help given the fiscal
 
02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
constraints around this if we're looking
 
02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
at modifying the three and a half down
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
to one and a half we're essentially
 
02:51:13.849 --> 02:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
spreading a
 
02:51:16.090 --> 02:51:16.100 align:start position:0%
a moderate amount of money much wider
 
02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
a large amount of money more narrowly
 
02:51:22.969 --> 02:51:22.979 align:start position:0%
focused for those catastrophic cases so
 
02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
what do you think the funds would look
 
02:51:26.290 --> 02:51:26.300 align:start position:0%
like around this if say instead of
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
modifying the three and a half to one
 
02:51:29.809 --> 02:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
and a half we actually looked at the 20
 
02:51:31.849 --> 02:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
percent and eliminated that and
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at a hundred percent over
 
02:51:36.830 --> 02:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:43.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:51:43.210 --> 02:51:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
it was 100 it would be 100 reimbursement
 
02:51:48.290 --> 02:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
over that three and a half number it
 
02:51:51.410 --> 02:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
would be like a 402 placement kind of
 
02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:54.010 align:start position:0%
would be like a 402 placement kind of
situation

02:51:54.010 --> 02:51:54.020 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
oh sorry never mind it would be 10
 
02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:52:00.050 --> 02:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars but you're still just
 
02:52:01.969 --> 02:52:01.979 align:start position:0%
talking about that same core set of kids
 
02:52:03.889 --> 02:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
sure but you're absolutely right so if
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
you don't add appropriation to this bill
 
02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
and you just do it this way you're just
 
02:52:09.349 --> 02:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to further dilute the funding
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it's representative luno it's
 
02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh in Roman numeral three
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's the proration is in Roman numeral
 
02:52:16.319 --> 02:52:17.750 align:start position:0%
it's the proration is in Roman numeral
three

02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
02:52:23.570 --> 02:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
committee here yes yeah um thanks thanks
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think to the the point you
 
02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
raised um Mr chair and representative
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
Myler with regards to the timing of the
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
payment I just want to make sure I
 
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
understand this so if um if School
 
02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:38.510 align:start position:0%
understand this so if um if School
District

02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:52:40.730 --> 02:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
has a two hundred thousand dollar out of
 
02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:45.140 align:start position:0%
District placement during the um the
 
02:52:48.050 --> 02:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
2022-2023 school year that we're in
 
02:52:49.550 --> 02:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:52:51.769 --> 02:52:51.779 align:start position:0%
um when would um when would that
 
02:52:55.070 --> 02:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
District receive reimbursement uh from
 
02:52:57.889 --> 02:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
the special education Aid fund under
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
the following year so I just wanted to
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
make yeah make sure that was clear thank
 
02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:11.090 align:start position:0%
make yeah make sure that was clear thank
you

02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:53:13.730 --> 02:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
yes reps and Damon
 
02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:53:18.290 --> 02:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how often that extensive
 
02:53:23.389 --> 02:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
presents anything different in the cost
 
02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
than the school district presented and
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
then I have a follow-up depending on the
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
answer so that would be a better
 
02:53:32.330 --> 02:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
question for Rebecca Fredette so
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully she can provide that
 
02:53:34.969 --> 02:53:34.979 align:start position:0%
information to the committee at a
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
different time
 
02:53:40.969 --> 02:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah go ahead so I'm just going
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
to rhetorically ask the follow-up
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be possible for
 
02:53:49.250 --> 02:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
some amount say 50 percent
 
02:53:51.469 --> 02:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the expected reimbursement to be made
 
02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
available sooner
 
02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
if there's not often a substantial
 
02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
difference so the challenge with making
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
it available sooner is that it's
 
02:54:04.190 --> 02:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
prorated across the entire state if
 
02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
there were one District at a time but
 
02:54:09.170 --> 02:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
and this is true of all you know I think
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see other bills that I'm going to
 
02:54:12.110 --> 02:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
talk about is proration prorating
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
everybody across everybody else one
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
District making a substantial so you
 
02:54:17.090 --> 02:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
might have a district that has one
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
student with a two hundred thousand
 
02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
dollar placement that maybe shouldn't
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
have gone through and now that's going
 
02:54:23.929 --> 02:54:23.939 align:start position:0%
to throw off everybody in the entire
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
State once that proration is applied
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and and the um to further complicate
 
02:54:33.230 --> 02:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
this we do provide estimates to the
 
02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and they're doing
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
their tax rate setting on October 1st
 
02:54:40.010 --> 02:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
before the payments are finalized for
 
02:54:41.389 --> 02:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
their tax rate setting in the fall so
 
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
they're using this number so
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
um one must that if you are throwing
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
everybody off it just is not great
 
02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.370 align:start position:0%
everybody off it just is not great
policy

02:54:49.370 --> 02:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:54:51.410 --> 02:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cornell has her handle her
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
name represent mileage I I think I'm
 
02:54:59.570 --> 02:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
confusing myself now
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
I always thought catastrophic aid while
 
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
whatever was it's for placement
 
02:55:06.769 --> 02:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
residential placements or placements or
 
02:55:10.250 --> 02:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
no so it's for any child that has costs
 
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
above a special education costs above
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
the cap which is that sixty thousand
 
02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
dollars so they could all be incurred
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
locally within their school district but
 
02:55:19.610 --> 02:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
there are tends to Outer District
 
02:55:21.469 --> 02:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
assessments tend to have a higher cost
 
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
so there tends to be a lot of students
 
02:55:24.769 --> 02:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
that are out of District placements that
 
02:55:26.269 --> 02:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
are receiving are eligible for the state
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
special education
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
so if we drop it from sixty seven
 
02:55:32.809 --> 02:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
thousand to thirty thousand I mean
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's pretty easy to reach for
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
anybody and like if you're in an Autism
 
02:55:40.969 --> 02:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
program and get a lot of services that's
 
02:55:42.309 --> 02:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's easy
 
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it depends quite
 
02:55:46.490 --> 02:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
honestly I mean
 
02:55:48.230 --> 02:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
districts already as part of their
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year data have to take
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
their staff especially for special
 
02:55:55.790 --> 02:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
education and divide their staff members
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
by the number of students that they
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
serve and figure out what their hourly
 
02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
rate is and how much each student counts
 
02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
per hour Etc so districts are already
 
02:56:05.929 --> 02:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
doing that in data at the beginning of
 
02:56:07.969 --> 02:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
the year sometimes in District
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
programming can be more costly than an
 
02:56:12.730 --> 02:56:12.740 align:start position:0%
out of disreplacement because you are
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
infusing your General Ed setting with
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
supports and services so students can
 
02:56:19.130 --> 02:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
remain in the General Ed setting because
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
that is what is least restrictive for
 
02:56:22.730 --> 02:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
that student and that's what the IEP
 
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
team thinks is the most appropriate so
 
02:56:30.170 --> 02:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
that can be as costly it's typically not
 
02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily as costly as some out of
 
02:56:34.190 --> 02:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
District placements but again it's very
 
02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
variable and it's also about economy of
 
02:56:38.450 --> 02:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
scale if you are in a very small
 
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
district and you have one student with a
 
02:56:45.530 --> 02:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
very low incidence but High need and
 
02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
you're creating an industry program for
 
02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
one student that can be very costly even
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
if it's the right thing to do whereas if
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
you're in a district with 10 or 12
 
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
students with that same kind of need
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more cost effective to
 
02:57:00.650 --> 02:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
develop an in-district program because
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're serving 12 kids instead of one
 
02:57:05.690 --> 02:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
student or it may be more cost effective
 
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
in that small District to send that
 
02:57:09.290 --> 02:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
student out of District but you can't
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
make a decision solely based on the
 
02:57:11.279 --> 02:57:12.130 align:start position:0%
make a decision solely based on the
financial

02:57:12.130 --> 02:57:12.140 align:start position:0%
financial
 
02:57:15.170 --> 02:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
aspects of that placement so it becomes
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
a little complex
 
02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:17.929 align:start position:0%
a little complex
um

02:57:17.929 --> 02:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:19.969 --> 02:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the effect would be in
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
terms of number of students from like a
 
02:57:24.050 --> 02:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
departmental data level but you
 
02:57:25.969 --> 02:57:25.979 align:start position:0%
certainly could ask districts what how
 
02:57:28.190 --> 02:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
many kids they think would meet the cap
 
02:57:29.570 --> 02:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
it would be a little bit of a Time
 
02:57:32.090 --> 02:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
intensive process but I think they're
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
already collecting the data if you
 
02:57:35.690 --> 02:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
helped them figure out what data they
 
02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
needed to determine that at the local
 
02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
level I think most people could probably
 
02:57:40.849 --> 02:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:57:42.650 --> 02:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for their further question
 
02:57:44.750 --> 02:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
represent Myler thank you this this has
 
02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
been very instructive thank you but I'm
 
02:57:49.490 --> 02:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think I'm a little confused of one
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
thing Caitlyn from a standpoint of the
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
department you have budgeted x amount of
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for special ed reimbursements if
 
02:58:03.769 --> 02:58:03.779 align:start position:0%
if the total for the amounts coming in
 
02:58:05.690 --> 02:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
from all the school districts
 
02:58:07.490 --> 02:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
is less
 
02:58:10.190 --> 02:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
than what you have budgeted
 
02:58:12.769 --> 02:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
do you then prorate that either up or
 
02:58:16.490 --> 02:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
down based upon that or if if the amount
 
02:58:20.330 --> 02:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
is over what you've budgeted explain the
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
variance of that please so we would only
 
02:58:25.849 --> 02:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
prorate down we would not prorate up so
 
02:58:28.849 --> 02:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
if if after we go through that
 
02:58:28.859 --> 02:58:30.410 align:start position:0%
if if after we go through that
calculation

02:58:30.410 --> 02:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
02:58:32.090 --> 02:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and we figure out that a student is
 
02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for 80 of its 80 percent of
 
02:58:37.550 --> 02:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
their costs reimbursed then we will pay
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
them 80 percent of those costs we would
 
02:58:42.170 --> 02:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
never then take that 80 and change it to
 
02:58:44.750 --> 02:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
85 percent because that 80 percent is in
 
02:58:48.170 --> 02:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
the statute but if we have only enough
 
02:58:51.769 --> 02:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
money to pay 75 of that 80 that's when
 
02:58:54.830 --> 02:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
we prorate that down thank you
 
02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions uh
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of questions
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
we have but is there further questions
 
02:59:00.479 --> 02:59:02.510 align:start position:0%
we have but is there further questions
for

02:59:02.510 --> 02:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
the yes go ahead reverse McDonald thank
 
02:59:08.030 --> 02:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for the expertise both
 
02:59:10.370 --> 02:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
of you um to clarify on a point you made
 
02:59:12.650 --> 02:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
earlier Caitlin
 
02:59:12.660 --> 02:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
earlier Caitlin
um

02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:16.370 --> 02:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
would this bill need to add an amendment
 
02:59:19.370 --> 02:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
or some kind of appropriation for this
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
communities that already meet the three
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
and a half times threshold to get the
 
02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
same amount of Aid if there's going to
 
02:59:26.809 --> 02:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
be more communities that would meet the
 
02:59:28.490 --> 02:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
one and a half time threshold
 
02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
this will reduce the amount of money
 
02:59:32.990 --> 02:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
available to those existing communities
 
02:59:39.889 --> 02:59:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:43.010 --> 02:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions we're
 
02:59:45.650 --> 02:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
going to work on this folks it this
 
02:59:47.150 --> 02:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
whole thing gets into the area of
 
02:59:49.969 --> 02:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
weighted categories for the i-13 IEP
 
02:59:52.130 --> 02:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
categories as well it's all sort of
 
02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
related you know what's the cost of this
 
02:59:56.510 --> 02:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
category versus that category and
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's a huge huge problem which we've had
 
03:00:03.050 --> 03:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
03:00:10.849 --> 03:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:13.250 --> 03:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
so that does close down the cards which
 
03:00:15.650 --> 03:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
are are the testimony for this it's 12
 
03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
o'clock and so we're closing down 577.

Education to administer the education
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
04:07:54.650 --> 04:07:54.660 align:start position:0%

um represent luno thank you very much Mr
 
04:08:02.929 --> 04:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
um for the record Dave luno representing
 
04:08:08.570 --> 04:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
the people of uh Merrimack District 9
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
which are folks who who live in Beau and
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton but as um as representative
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
Miler well knows uh we used to also
 
04:08:20.330 --> 04:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
represent people in Concord we're not
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to let them go that quickly so um
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
so here's the people at Concord too but
 
04:08:28.610 --> 04:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
frankly I like to think that we also
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
represent people all across the granite
 
04:08:33.170 --> 04:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
state because all of us have have
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
statewide responsibilities and while
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
they may not
 
04:08:40.370 --> 04:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
see our names on their ballots uh when
 
04:08:42.530 --> 04:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
we're when we're considering policy like
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
this or any of the other bills certainly
 
04:08:48.290 --> 04:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
all the granite Staters are are really
 
04:08:51.110 --> 04:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
important and relevant to um to our
 
04:08:53.450 --> 04:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
deliberations so
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you of of us uh
 
04:08:58.809 --> 04:08:58.819 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
04:09:02.150 --> 04:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
is related to the um the education
 
04:09:04.729 --> 04:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program which was
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
established in the current state budget
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 but it actually stemmed
 
04:09:14.689 --> 04:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
from House Bill 20 which was heard in
 
04:09:17.090 --> 04:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
this committee uh
 
04:09:21.790 --> 04:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.010 --> 04:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
back during the the two days I think we
 
04:09:27.889 --> 04:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
had a a rock solid two days worth of
 
04:09:31.729 --> 04:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
hearings on House Bill 20. uh the um the
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet sign ups which uh are are
 
04:09:38.450 --> 04:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
basically people uh members of the
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
public who are signing up
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
um in support and in opposition to
 
04:09:43.560 --> 04:09:44.889 align:start position:0%
um in support and in opposition to
legislation

04:09:44.889 --> 04:09:44.899 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 20 there were 1107 uh
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
that signed up in support of the
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program and
 
04:09:54.910 --> 04:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
there were
 
04:09:59.330 --> 04:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
5218 who signed up against the education
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program and uh
 
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know there was there was General I
 
04:10:08.090 --> 04:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
think displeasure and unease uh
 
04:10:10.849 --> 04:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
expressed by uh by taxpayers from across
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
the state who objected to the idea of
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
using taxpayer dollars to pay for uh
 
04:10:18.410 --> 04:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
private and Home School uh tuition
 
04:10:21.530 --> 04:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
choices that um that other families may
 
04:10:25.010 --> 04:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
may elect to to make and um and
 
04:10:27.650 --> 04:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
particularly on top of the uh the
 
04:10:30.889 --> 04:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
already substantial support that local
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers have for their local
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
public schools because
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
um as we all know most of the local
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
school budgets are are paid for through
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh through local uh property taxes so
 
04:10:45.239 --> 04:10:47.570 align:start position:0%
uh through local uh property taxes so
so

04:10:47.570 --> 04:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:49.969 --> 04:10:49.979 align:start position:0%
you know we talked about yesterday how
 
04:10:52.250 --> 04:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
um were were billed as as something that
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
was going to provide great savings to uh
 
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
to local property taxes but
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that has not um developed
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
at all so so this year
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
there's a package of bills that uh that
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
we have that sponsored that looked to
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
bring some accountability oversight and
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
transparency to the education Freedom
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
account program they're not eliminating
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
the program but they're providing some
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
some accountability to the taxpayers who
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
are who are who are you know paying for
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
these private school tuition bills and
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 626 the one in front of us uh
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
this afternoon is one of them so the the
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
title of the bill is requiring the
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to administer
 
04:11:47.570 --> 04:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account uh program
 
04:11:50.809 --> 04:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
and and you know over the I think this
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill seven pages long that's probably 90
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
95 plus percent of it so most of it is
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
replacing the um the uh the scholarship
 
04:12:06.110 --> 04:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
organization the term scholarship
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
organization with the Department of
 
04:12:12.050 --> 04:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
Education or the the State Board of
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
Education which is the governance of of
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
the of the uh of of a lot of their their
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
policies and um
 
04:12:23.570 --> 04:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
and it really eliminates the um the
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
Scholarship Foundation from the uh the
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
administration of um of this of the
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program so why
 
04:12:32.809 --> 04:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
is this important
 
04:12:32.819 --> 04:12:34.370 align:start position:0%
is this important
so

04:12:34.370 --> 04:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:37.250 --> 04:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know all in following these first
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
two years of of the program where uh New
 
04:12:44.750 --> 04:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers are um are into it
 
04:12:47.809 --> 04:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
by about 30 million dollars not quite 30
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
million I think it was 27 point
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
something million dollars currently in
 
04:12:53.330 --> 04:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
the first two years of the program and
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education has
 
04:12:57.769 --> 04:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
already put in a request for another 60
 
04:12:59.929 --> 04:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh over the next
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
biennium to uh to fund education Freedom
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
accounts so so all in it and uh that's
 
04:13:12.050 --> 04:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars that the um that
 
04:13:14.090 --> 04:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization gets to
 
04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
retain for their own overhead costs and
 
04:13:21.769 --> 04:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
um nine million dollars and um going
 
04:13:23.210 --> 04:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
essentially going to a private
 
04:13:26.269 --> 04:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
contractor through a no bid uh contract
 
04:13:28.969 --> 04:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
that was approved by the um the
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
executive Council uh just about two
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
years ago and um and so that's why it's
 
04:13:38.929 --> 04:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
important so so why should and I think
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is a reasonable question on the
 
04:13:43.849 --> 04:13:43.859 align:start position:0%
part of the taxpayers why should my tax
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
dollars be going to cover overhead for a
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
scholar for the for the private
 
04:13:52.969 --> 04:13:52.979 align:start position:0%
contractor overseeing the program
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
when we're already paying for Department
 
04:13:59.110 --> 04:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
of Education that um that that oversees
 
04:14:03.170 --> 04:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
the education of um of New Hampshire's
 
04:14:03.180 --> 04:14:05.150 align:start position:0%
the education of um of New Hampshire's
kids

04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:14:05.160 --> 04:14:05.689 align:start position:0%
kids
um

04:14:05.689 --> 04:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's the first question
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
that I think this this uh this uh that
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 626
 
04:14:18.769 --> 04:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
um provides the answer other I think is
 
04:14:22.490 --> 04:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
um is over this last two-year period of
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
time the only information we've received
 
04:14:26.880 --> 04:14:28.490 align:start position:0%
time the only information we've received
from

04:14:28.490 --> 04:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:14:31.490 --> 04:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
the um the the private contractor
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
overseeing the program
 
04:14:37.010 --> 04:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh to a cost to taxpayers of nine
 
04:14:40.130 --> 04:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars are basically this these
 
04:14:42.110 --> 04:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
two pieces of paper and yeah there's
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
some backup paper to it as well but um
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
but and and honestly the um the reports
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
here we talked about reporting this
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
morning reporting in data collection
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
the the reporting here is laughable
 
04:15:00.410 --> 04:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
so you know in one
 
04:15:03.050 --> 04:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
actually on both of these reports they
 
04:15:05.210 --> 04:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
talk about the current number of
 
04:15:08.090 --> 04:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
students who switched from a public
 
04:15:08.100 --> 04:15:10.429 align:start position:0%
students who switched from a public
school

04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
to take a education Freedom account to
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
open an educational Freedom accountant
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
and attend something other than than a
 
04:15:20.929 --> 04:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
public school and then they then they
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
add into that people who did that or
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
students who did that during the the
 
04:15:29.090 --> 04:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
pandemic which actually happened prior
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the education Freedom accounts ever
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
being authorized by the state and then
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
it even goes on to talk about
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
pre-covered switchers prior to 2020 and
 
04:15:42.729 --> 04:15:42.739 align:start position:0%
the number of students who joined
 
04:15:46.010 --> 04:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts so so it's
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
sort of laughable what um uh what this
 
04:15:51.650 --> 04:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
what this talks about here and um and
 
04:15:54.290 --> 04:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
rather than than actually breaking out
 
04:15:54.300 --> 04:15:55.849 align:start position:0%
rather than than actually breaking out
the

04:15:55.849 --> 04:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:59.330 --> 04:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
um the the costs I mean there's some
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
general categories there's there's lots
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
of data as to where these students where
 
04:16:07.929 --> 04:16:07.939 align:start position:0%
they live what districts they come from
 
04:16:11.150 --> 04:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
lots of data with respect to what it
 
04:16:13.490 --> 04:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
would have cost taxpayers had all these
 
04:16:16.370 --> 04:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
students been in their their um their
 
04:16:20.150 --> 04:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
Public Schools but as we know from from
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
at least the little bit of you know uh
 
04:16:27.070 --> 04:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
sketchy information from these reports
 
04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
at least 75 percent and probably even
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
more than that of these students were
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
either already in private school or
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to go to private school or another
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
or another non-public option anyway
 
04:16:43.370 --> 04:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
um and and have no cost to taxpayers so
 
04:16:43.380 --> 04:16:44.689 align:start position:0%
um and and have no cost to taxpayers so
so

04:16:44.689 --> 04:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:47.330 --> 04:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
how the money is being used
 
04:16:50.450 --> 04:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
and transparency in terms of reporting
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
that I think would be fair in order for
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
the program to be more accountable to
 
04:16:58.729 --> 04:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who are now on the hook if
 
04:17:01.070 --> 04:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
this gets put into the budget for 90
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
of costs in the in the first few years
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
of of this program so that's the first
 
04:17:10.729 --> 04:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
part of that's most of this bill the um
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill
 
04:17:14.570 --> 04:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
um is really is really accountability
 
04:17:18.170 --> 04:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
and it's only on in a few um a few
 
04:17:20.330 --> 04:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
section A few sections the first is
 
04:17:22.969 --> 04:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
section six on page one and so this is
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
down towards the bottom of the page on
 
04:17:29.689 --> 04:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
lines 24-27 and it's um it's you know
 
04:17:31.610 --> 04:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
what happens when money's left over in
 
04:17:35.210 --> 04:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
account and in in the in an edge unused
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
money left over in education Freedom
 
04:17:39.050 --> 04:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
account and it basically says that the
 
04:17:41.929 --> 04:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
money gets rolled back into the the
 
04:17:44.570 --> 04:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so remember this
 
04:17:47.809 --> 04:17:47.819 align:start position:0%
it's taxpayer money and then the um then
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
the the other piece in this bill that I
 
04:17:53.210 --> 04:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
think is is um related to accountability
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we talk about this in fact we talked
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
about it this morning
 
04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
um is uh is how do we know how well our
 
04:18:02.570 --> 04:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
students are are doing and um and so on
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
page two towards the middle of the page
 
04:18:10.969 --> 04:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
lines 22 through 25 uh it eliminates you
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
know this sort of you know random
 
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
nationally standardized Norm referenced
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
achievement test that doesn't really tie
 
04:18:19.610 --> 04:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
into anything that you can compare with
 
04:18:21.170 --> 04:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
how students in New Hampshire are doing
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um and requires
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh EFA students to essentially take
 
04:18:29.090 --> 04:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
the same Statewide student assessments
 
04:18:31.370 --> 04:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
that all of our Public School uh
 
04:18:33.410 --> 04:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
students take and you know give us
 
04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
something to to compare to
 
04:18:37.550 --> 04:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
accountability is important I mean we
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
heard about it this morning and it
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
should be important
 
04:18:43.010 --> 04:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
for people who are Advocates of
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom accounts and so I
 
04:18:49.370 --> 04:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
think By Us by by establishing these
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
guard rails
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
um will be able to
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
um to you know improve the program have
 
04:18:58.849 --> 04:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
a program that's more accountable and um
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
and uh and transparent to um to the
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and help be able to have some
 
04:19:07.490 --> 04:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
real oversight by by the legislature
 
04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
just like our public school programs uh
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
have so we hope that members of the
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee will support these reasonable
 
04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
guard rails again it's a light touch
 
04:19:20.570 --> 04:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
um uh to protect uh taxpayers and
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
improve transparency and be happy to
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
take some questions
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
questions for representative luno yes
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
04:19:33.290 --> 04:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you um we heard from the
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education this morning
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
that they're already
 
04:19:38.330 --> 04:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
um strained a little bit because they
 
04:19:41.450 --> 04:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
have a heavy workload so how is this not
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
just another thing for the Department to
 
04:19:45.290 --> 04:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
do and right now another organization is
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
handling it no thank you very much for
 
04:19:49.490 --> 04:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
the for the question that's in that's an
 
04:19:51.050 --> 04:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
04:19:53.210 --> 04:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
um you know one way I think of of
 
04:19:56.090 --> 04:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
looking looking at this is that the the
 
04:19:58.969 --> 04:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
department could could likely hire a new
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
employee and I think we saw some numbers
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
this morning that the first year of a
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
hire might be around 165 000 uh compared
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
to the nine million dollars that we're
 
04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
currently spending
 
04:20:12.590 --> 04:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
um to uh to manage the EFA program
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
through an independent contract through
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
a private contractor so I think using
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
some of that nine million dollars would
 
04:20:21.950 --> 04:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh to to have a data collection and data
 
04:20:24.769 --> 04:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
reporting uh specialist and then use
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
using the the balance of that nine
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars which if if the if that
 
04:20:33.050 --> 04:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
position costs 165 000 would be about uh
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
8.2 million dollars
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
and um being able to uh to either use
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
that for um for efas
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
so it would actually go to uh go to
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
students opportunity or use that um you
 
04:20:50.090 --> 04:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
know as as state funds that we could put
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
towards any of the other initiatives
 
04:20:54.530 --> 04:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
that we talked about this morning so so
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think I thank you very much for the
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
question and and I and I um that's
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I would suggest further
 
04:21:00.600 --> 04:21:02.570 align:start position:0%
that's what I would suggest further
questions

04:21:02.570 --> 04:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:21:05.210 --> 04:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um thank you uh
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
when these were first uh proposed I
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
understood that some of the reason for
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
using a Scholarship Foundation was to
 
04:21:20.090 --> 04:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
avoid uh direct money from taxpayers
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to fund religious schools or
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
religious education and I I understand
 
04:21:26.809 --> 04:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
you know the Supreme Court ruling is
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
that they can do that but I'm looking at
 
04:21:28.800 --> 04:21:30.290 align:start position:0%
that they can do that but I'm looking at
religious

04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
religious
 
04:21:32.929 --> 04:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
um curriculum or things like that is is
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
there a problem with State money going
 
04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
directly to these or these organizations
 
04:21:39.769 --> 04:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
or these businesses which are strictly
 
04:21:42.110 --> 04:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
religious yeah no thanks thanks for
 
04:21:43.849 --> 04:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
04:21:46.130 --> 04:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I I've certainly heard
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
arguments on on both sides of that I
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
personally believe that that that public
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
money should not be used for for
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
religious schools and I believe there is
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
a provision in our New Hampshire
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution to prevent public tax
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
dollars to be used for
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
um for religious um uh education I'm not
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
aware of any U.S Supreme Supreme Court
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
rulings that would necessarily change
 
04:22:12.239 --> 04:22:13.330 align:start position:0%
rulings that would necessarily change
that

04:22:13.330 --> 04:22:13.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:16.090 --> 04:22:16.100 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
04:22:20.809 --> 04:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
that specific provision but but to say
 
04:22:22.969 --> 04:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire and its
 
04:22:25.090 --> 04:22:25.100 align:start position:0%
time that taxpayers in New Hampshire
 
04:22:27.769 --> 04:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
should be charged nine million dollars
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
to an organization to basically
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
um pretend that that it's no longer
 
04:22:37.729 --> 04:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money and um and and fund
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
scholarships I mean I think there are
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
words for uh for that type of um
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know hide and seek of
 
04:22:50.330 --> 04:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
of of money and um I'll leave it to the
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
committee members to determine what
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
those words are but uh but to me that's
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
not that's not what uh what taxpayers
 
04:22:59.570 --> 04:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
sign up to when they're um when they're
 
04:23:00.889 --> 04:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
sending their money to the state
 
04:23:03.170 --> 04:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:04.500 --> 04:23:06.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:23:06.290 --> 04:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:08.570 --> 04:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
if the money is given to the parents to
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
do what they wish to do with it then
 
04:23:14.330 --> 04:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's really not hide and seek it is a
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
decision uh by a different entity that
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
now has a responsibility over the money
 
04:23:24.650 --> 04:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure how that's playing a
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
game okay
 
04:23:28.370 --> 04:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
um thanks very much for the for the
 
04:23:28.380 --> 04:23:29.389 align:start position:0%
um thanks very much for the for the
question

04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:23:31.610 --> 04:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
um if if I'm able to take what you just
 
04:23:34.189 --> 04:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
said it absolute face value that it's up
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
to the parent to be able to spend that
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
money how they like then I'm not sure
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
why you need an independent or a private
 
04:23:42.769 --> 04:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
contractor to do that why the parent
 
04:23:42.779 --> 04:23:43.849 align:start position:0%
contractor to do that why the parent
can't

04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
um can't be the buffer between the state
 
04:23:50.570 --> 04:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
and how that that money is being spent
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
so so I really don't see the necessity
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
of of having a a a a private contractor
 
04:23:59.929 --> 04:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
in uh in that role and that's what I
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
mean by by hide and seek if you're
 
04:24:06.170 --> 04:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
really that worried about the um the the
 
04:24:09.530 --> 04:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
the perception of um of what this is
 
04:24:12.410 --> 04:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
than than having a private contractor uh
 
04:24:15.530 --> 04:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
in the middle costing taxpayers
 
04:24:18.110 --> 04:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
um nine million dollars a year producing
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
these two reports which I don't think
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
are going to please any anybody
 
04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
um you know paying paying whose tax
 
04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
dollars are being used to fund this
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
program and especially given the uh the
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelming opposition to this program
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
I think you're putting yourself out
 
04:24:35.520 --> 04:24:36.769 align:start position:0%
I think you're putting yourself out
there

04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:36.779 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:24:39.530 --> 04:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
rather than rather than you know having
 
04:24:41.450 --> 04:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
something having guard rails in place
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
that uh that improve and make the
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
program more accountable to taxpayers
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned bringing in uh the
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
sort of standardized testing across CFA
 
04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
programs to to look to see how they're
 
04:24:59.929 --> 04:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
doing in comparison to our more
 
04:25:01.630 --> 04:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
but my question is is it reasonable for
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
us to expect that students who
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
um perhaps dropped out of high school
 
04:25:14.090 --> 04:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
and then picked up the EFA program and
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
are in an alternative program or
 
04:25:17.210 --> 04:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
students who are in the EFA program
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's focused on either religious
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
education or a music education to
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
achieve parity in more traditional
 
04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
subjects with traditional public school
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
students no thanks thanks very much for
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
the question so so there's nothing in
 
04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
the um in the bill here that would
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
require students to either be on be
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
parody Or Be Be have to score above a
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
certain level on any particular test in
 
04:25:49.309 --> 04:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
fact the Statewide assessment test is is
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
already I think a possibility in here
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
yep that on line 26 on page page two so
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
if that's not even something new in here
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
but but I think taxpayers certainly have
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
a right to question how their how their
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
dollars are being used and what the
 
04:26:11.090 --> 04:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
results of of that are they certainly
 
04:26:12.889 --> 04:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
have a right to do that with Public
 
04:26:15.889 --> 04:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
Schools they know what that is
 
04:26:17.689 --> 04:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
um uh you know
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
for public schools and uh and if their
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
tax as their tax dollars are being used
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
to to fund non-public options uh they
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
should they should be able to know that
 
04:26:28.969 --> 04:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
and I think the the conditions that that
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
you laid out representative you know
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to um to some types of of
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
students I think the public I think
 
04:26:37.250 --> 04:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
members of the public would understand
 
04:26:37.260 --> 04:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
members of the public would understand
that

04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
um uh you know as long as some context
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
was was provided you know along those
 
04:26:45.889 --> 04:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
ways but to have something that just
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't relate back at all I I don't
 
04:26:50.570 --> 04:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
think that's that's not transparent to
 
04:26:50.580 --> 04:26:51.889 align:start position:0%
think that's that's not transparent to
anybody

04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.889 --> 04:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
I have all kinds of questions on these
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
but we can do them
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
not in power I mean we can do them in
 
04:27:04.370 --> 04:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
exact instead of here for the interest
 
04:27:05.929 --> 04:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
of time so I'm just going to pick one
 
04:27:08.450 --> 04:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay and that's the one you keep
 
04:27:11.689 --> 04:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
referring to all this money that goes
 
04:27:11.699 --> 04:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
referring to all this money that goes
out

04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:27:16.370 --> 04:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
um the up to up to 10 percent
 
04:27:19.370 --> 04:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
you were one of the ones who wanted all
 
04:27:25.070 --> 04:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
of this accountability transparency
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that no money was
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
spent that didn't need to be spent and
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
the way that that has been accommodated
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
accomplished is by hiring by the
 
04:27:39.290 --> 04:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization hiring an
 
04:27:42.290 --> 04:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
organization to do all of that and that
 
04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
takes up most of the 10 percent and the
 
04:27:48.889 --> 04:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
question is if you took it out but you
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
didn't put it back in anywhere who's
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to do all of the okay every single
 
04:27:54.000 --> 04:27:55.550 align:start position:0%
going to do all of the okay every single
vendor

04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
04:27:57.710 --> 04:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
um okaying every single purchase because
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
every single purchase is okayed as per
 
04:28:01.620 --> 04:28:03.050 align:start position:0%
every single purchase is okayed as per
request

04:28:03.050 --> 04:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
from people who wanted accountability
 
04:28:07.729 --> 04:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
that is the accountability every single
 
04:28:12.050 --> 04:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
purchase is okayed so where is that
 
04:28:15.170 --> 04:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
going to come you've taken the money out
 
04:28:17.929 --> 04:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
I don't see it being put back in and
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's a whole company that does that
 
04:28:23.210 --> 04:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
plus at least four people in the
 
04:28:26.330 --> 04:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
um and you're saying that one person in
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education can now do
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
what all of this is doing I want to know
 
04:28:32.689 --> 04:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
how you plan on accomplishing that or
 
04:28:34.010 --> 04:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
are you just going to leave it up to the
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
parents like it sounded like you just
 
04:28:35.880 --> 04:28:36.590 align:start position:0%
parents like it sounded like you just
said

04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
so so um so thanks I mean I I um
 
04:28:44.210 --> 04:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
you know believe private companies uh do
 
04:28:46.010 --> 04:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
it all the time I've been involved with
 
04:28:48.290 --> 04:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
a number of technology companies that
 
04:28:50.269 --> 04:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
have um you know a purchasing manager
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
purchasing person that oversees purchase
 
04:28:54.769 --> 04:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
orders uh for all sorts of different
 
04:28:58.729 --> 04:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
items uh most school districts have won
 
04:29:00.410 --> 04:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
um uh administrator business
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
administrator that uh that that oversees
 
04:29:04.199 --> 04:29:04.969 align:start position:0%
administrator that uh that that oversees
um

04:29:04.969 --> 04:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:04.979 --> 04:29:06.490 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:29:06.490 --> 04:29:06.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
honestly over a two-year period even a
 
04:29:11.330 --> 04:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
small District might have a greater
 
04:29:13.729 --> 04:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
budget than the uh than the EFA program
 
04:29:16.610 --> 04:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
so uh so public school districts do it
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
all the time they don't
 
04:29:23.689 --> 04:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
um to my knowledge uh uh spend uh uh you
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
know you know nine million dollars on uh
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
on on just a couple people in central
 
04:29:32.929 --> 04:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
office to uh to track these things so so
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
the you know leaving up to the parents I
 
04:29:37.729 --> 04:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
don't think is the right um is the right
 
04:29:40.010 --> 04:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
answer but I think the department could
 
04:29:43.610 --> 04:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
could provide a much better solution to
 
04:29:46.610 --> 04:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
um uh to doing this than um than it what
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
it appears the um the private contractor
 
04:29:52.910 --> 04:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
is doing what follow-up
 
04:29:55.010 --> 04:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
um when we asked this question at the
 
04:29:57.050 --> 04:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
time this was originally being
 
04:29:57.060 --> 04:29:58.429 align:start position:0%
time this was originally being
introduced

04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
we were told by I think it was Caitlyn
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
Davis she looked at what it costs
 
04:30:06.530 --> 04:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
regular public schools and she said it
 
04:30:08.809 --> 04:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
was more than 10 percent is what they
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
were spending so my question that's what
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
regular public schools are spending more
 
04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
than 10 percent of their budget on doing
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
this Administration
 
04:30:21.769 --> 04:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
their use of doing it in less than 10
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
percent which you've taken out and so I
 
04:30:26.450 --> 04:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
still want to know and did we heard from
 
04:30:28.010 --> 04:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education how
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
overbooked they are now so
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to do that who's going to
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
pay for it where does the money come
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
from sure so so you know what I'm going
 
04:30:37.199 --> 04:30:38.290 align:start position:0%
from sure so so you know what I'm going
to

04:30:38.290 --> 04:30:38.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:30:40.490 --> 04:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
where does the money come from money
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
comes from the taxpayer
 
04:30:44.090 --> 04:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
um where does it where does it go
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
currently money that comes from the
 
04:30:49.010 --> 04:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayer goes to our goes through the
 
04:30:51.290 --> 04:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to our public
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
school districts and those public school
 
04:30:58.490 --> 04:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
districts have a um have a you know uh a
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
central office and then the schools that
 
04:31:03.530 --> 04:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
the central office administers and those
 
04:31:07.189 --> 04:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
costs are I agree about 10 but what
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
you're failing to to to recognize here
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
is that while while
 
04:31:15.229 --> 04:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
um a significant amount of the EFA
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
dollars are are not just going to um to
 
04:31:22.610 --> 04:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
home schools but they're going to um to
 
04:31:24.410 --> 04:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
private schools and other tuition
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
programs that also have a um uh an
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
Administration and management component
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is somewhere between 10 and 15 so
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
now whether rather than it being
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
contained in a public school at a total
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
cost to taxpayers of approximately 10
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
for administration costs now you've got
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
10 percent from the the um the private
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
contractor and another 10 or 15 coming
 
04:31:55.849 --> 04:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
from the um the uh the tuition uh Pro
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
the private school and uh so now now
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
essentially 25 of our taxpayer dollars
 
04:32:04.010 --> 04:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
are being used for non-educational
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
overhead and that I mean I from an
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
efficiency standpoint I'm not quite sure
 
04:32:12.110 --> 04:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
why that's uh you know appealing to
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
people in this committee let alone
 
04:32:17.530 --> 04:32:17.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who would like to see um uh uh
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
efficiency improved and for more of the
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
money uh certainly certainly more than
 
04:32:25.969 --> 04:32:25.979 align:start position:0%
75 percent of the money
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
um of their taxpayer dollars being going
 
04:32:30.769 --> 04:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
to a student-facing education purpose
 
04:32:33.170 --> 04:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
sources rather than overhead
 
04:32:36.050 --> 04:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you Mr
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
when we first started talking about
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
education savings accounts
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
um back a few years ago one of the
 
04:32:45.840 --> 04:32:47.710 align:start position:0%
um back a few years ago one of the
criticisms

04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
criticisms
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
was based on Arizona which had the first
 
04:32:55.610 --> 04:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
program in 2011 and the fact that they a
 
04:32:58.130 --> 04:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
few years later had an audit that found
 
04:33:02.210 --> 04:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
many problems with the program
 
04:33:02.220 --> 04:33:03.530 align:start position:0%
many problems with the program
um

04:33:03.530 --> 04:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:06.529 --> 04:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
that was raised as
 
04:33:08.631 --> 04:33:08.641 align:start position:0%
um a reason why we should not go down
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
this route
 
04:33:10.260 --> 04:33:11.150 align:start position:0%
this route
um

04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:15.051 --> 04:33:15.061 align:start position:0%
there are other examples as to problems
 
04:33:17.631 --> 04:33:17.641 align:start position:0%
when a government entity has
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
administered administered such a program
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh for instance Montana Department of
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue the Espinoza versus Montana case
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
where the Department of Revenue
 
04:33:27.719 --> 04:33:29.230 align:start position:0%
where the Department of Revenue
Administration

04:33:29.230 --> 04:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
04:33:32.631 --> 04:33:32.641 align:start position:0%
said we have a blame amendment in our
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
constitution you cannot send your kids
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
to religious schools Department of
 
04:33:41.470 --> 04:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration made that
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
determination contrary to the intent of
 
04:33:46.849 --> 04:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
the law and the decision was made by the
 
04:33:48.769 --> 04:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner of that department who
 
04:33:51.890 --> 04:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
retired a month later
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
um do you see any danger in a government
 
04:33:58.369 --> 04:33:58.379 align:start position:0%
entity uh that might change and not be
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
favorable to continuing such a program
 
04:34:03.890 --> 04:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
being placed in charge of such a program
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I think
 
04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
um you know having a program established
 
04:34:11.209 --> 04:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
in law I think does put a lot of
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
obligation on the on the government and
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
and governments are accountable through
 
04:34:17.631 --> 04:34:17.641 align:start position:0%
their elected officials uh currently
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
there's nobody accountable in the in the
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
private contractor to um to uh members
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
of the public to the voters the way the
 
04:34:28.849 --> 04:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
way government is um is accountable
 
04:34:31.730 --> 04:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
that's my first point my second point is
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
that when asked uh two weeks ago at the
 
04:34:38.029 --> 04:34:38.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Education when I
 
04:34:40.250 --> 04:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
specifically asked the commissioner what
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
information was was reviewed and this is
 
04:34:44.689 --> 04:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
referring to an interview that he gave
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire close up on um uh on
 
04:34:51.650 --> 04:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
our on WMUR the Sunday proceed eating
 
04:34:54.051 --> 04:34:54.061 align:start position:0%
and where he said he'd reviewed all the
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
information and he was confident that
 
04:34:59.330 --> 04:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
that there'd been no abuse and fraud the
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
way there has been in other states with
 
04:35:04.369 --> 04:35:04.379 align:start position:0%
these um with these programs I simply
 
04:35:06.109 --> 04:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
asked the commissioner what information
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
did you review and when can we review
 
04:35:10.369 --> 04:35:10.379 align:start position:0%
that material and the question was
 
04:35:10.379 --> 04:35:11.810 align:start position:0%
that material and the question was
avoided

04:35:11.810 --> 04:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
um uh and and you know what I'm I'm not
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
at all confident that through the the
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
the the the law that was um that was uh
 
04:35:23.090 --> 04:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
put into House Bill 2 put into the
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
current state budget provides any
 
04:35:28.010 --> 04:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
information flow from the private
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
contractor to the Department of
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
Education let alone anything that's
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to give the commissioner or
 
04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
anybody else at the department any
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
satisfaction that there's been no fraud
 
04:35:39.529 --> 04:35:39.539 align:start position:0%
or abuse in this program should the um
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
the department of of Education
 
04:35:43.970 --> 04:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
administer this program they would have
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
access to that material and be able to
 
04:35:48.769 --> 04:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
make a solid judgment that could be
 
04:35:52.849 --> 04:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
reviewed by by by other people and and
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
by taxpayers as well in a way that that
 
04:35:58.689 --> 04:35:58.699 align:start position:0%
does not disclose personally identical
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
identifiable information the same way we
 
04:36:03.170 --> 04:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
do for public schools and provide those
 
04:36:04.849 --> 04:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
assurances right now there's no
 
04:36:07.490 --> 04:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
assurances at all
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
about what
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
um in terms of no assurances at all it
 
04:36:14.631 --> 04:36:14.641 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the legislation does
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
require an audit on an annual basis by
 
04:36:22.490 --> 04:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
an independent auditor of the vendor who
 
04:36:24.650 --> 04:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
is performing the program
 
04:36:24.660 --> 04:36:25.250 align:start position:0%
is performing the program
um

04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
there are I think um or there is
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard from the director of
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
that organization that they provide
 
04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
um to the department
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and the department did release
 
04:36:41.929 --> 04:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
um information in September on their
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
website about the program
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
04:36:47.400 --> 04:36:49.310 align:start position:0%
um and um
the

04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:52.369 --> 04:36:52.379 align:start position:0%
language that's in law now was really
 
04:36:54.170 --> 04:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
based on a Senate bill
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
Our House Bill had additional Provisions
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
in it such as an annual report by the
 
04:37:04.090 --> 04:37:04.100 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization parent survey
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
a few other things and there we will
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
have a bill that does put those things
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
back into current law to help in terms
 
04:37:16.910 --> 04:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
of accountability and transparency in
 
04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
addition to clarifying that there would
 
04:37:23.289 --> 04:37:23.299 align:start position:0%
be multi there could be multiple
 
04:37:25.869 --> 04:37:25.879 align:start position:0%
organizations to administer this program
 
04:37:30.051 --> 04:37:30.061 align:start position:0%
which was unclear in current law and I
 
04:37:32.510 --> 04:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
have talked to the department and they
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
will issue an RFP
 
04:37:37.970 --> 04:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
um uh in the future for
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
um organizations to come forward
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
um and that the sole source contract
 
04:37:42.959 --> 04:37:44.410 align:start position:0%
um and that the sole source contract
initially

04:37:44.410 --> 04:37:44.420 align:start position:0%
initially
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
sent out in 2021 was because the this
 
04:37:52.250 --> 04:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship organization was
 
04:37:54.529 --> 04:37:54.539 align:start position:0%
the only one in the state that qualified
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
based on on law so
 
04:38:00.289 --> 04:38:00.299 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
 
04:38:00.299 --> 04:38:01.609 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
um

04:38:01.609 --> 04:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where the holes you see in
 
04:38:08.330 --> 04:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
accountability are
 
04:38:11.209 --> 04:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
um for for the program with the
 
04:38:12.529 --> 04:38:12.539 align:start position:0%
requirements we have and the
 
04:38:15.650 --> 04:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
requirements we will add because in my
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
mind the best form of accountability is
 
04:38:21.289 --> 04:38:21.299 align:start position:0%
with parents and they have ultimate
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
accountability for their children and
 
04:38:25.970 --> 04:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
they certainly doing this parent in this
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
program because if they're unhappy with
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
what's going on they can walk and that's
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
not always easy in a public school where
 
04:38:36.529 --> 04:38:36.539 align:start position:0%
they don't have that same ability be it
 
04:38:39.410 --> 04:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
based on uh districting
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where
 
04:38:44.929 --> 04:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
um you see the holes in the
 
04:38:46.609 --> 04:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency so thank
 
04:38:48.170 --> 04:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
you I heard that I heard the question in
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
there thank you very much representative
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
cordelli um I would just uh you know say
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
simply by the sheer lack of information
 
04:38:54.600 --> 04:38:56.209 align:start position:0%
simply by the sheer lack of information
that

04:38:56.209 --> 04:38:56.219 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
um uh that has been released so far by
 
04:39:01.609 --> 04:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education uh that uh
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
that it is um impossible to tell from
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
this that uh that taxpayer money is
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
being is being spent uh appropriately
 
04:39:13.369 --> 04:39:13.379 align:start position:0%
it's been absolutely impossible to get
 
04:39:16.131 --> 04:39:16.141 align:start position:0%
any specific information from the
 
04:39:18.529 --> 04:39:18.539 align:start position:0%
commissioner to exactly what material he
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
reviewed and how he came to the
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
conclusion that he came to and delivered
 
04:39:24.289 --> 04:39:24.299 align:start position:0%
publicly uh during New Hampshire
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
close-up two weeks ago and um and having
 
04:39:29.929 --> 04:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education administer
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
this at least would put the department
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
in a position where they have access to
 
04:39:37.131 --> 04:39:37.141 align:start position:0%
uh to all of that information and
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and and your your absolutely right I
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
think when it comes to parents being
 
04:39:45.530 --> 04:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
able to make make parents and families
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
and students being able to make their
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
own their own choices but when it comes
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
to other people's money when it comes to
 
04:39:53.630 --> 04:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money I don't think that's
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
where the only choice lies I think
 
04:39:58.670 --> 04:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have a right to know as well
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
and to elect public officials that carry
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
out their wishes in terms of
 
04:40:05.448 --> 04:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight and
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
transparency to make sure that their
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
precious taxpayer money is being being
 
04:40:13.250 --> 04:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
used in a way that um that that they
 
04:40:16.310 --> 04:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
feel meets meets the test
 
04:40:17.930 --> 04:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
I I've got a question for you
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
representing oh no
 
04:40:20.630 --> 04:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned the beginning you
 
04:40:22.010 --> 04:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
had two questions you were looking at
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
and one of those was why should the
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
state be allocating resources for the
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
administration or oversight of this
 
04:40:30.130 --> 04:40:30.140 align:start position:0%
program to the scholarship organization
 
04:40:32.930 --> 04:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
rather than using our own Department of
 
04:40:35.570 --> 04:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
Education I think that's basically one
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the questions you asked the question
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
I ask you in follow-up to that then have
 
04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
you worked or developed any kind of a
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
data sheet or worked with trying to get
 
04:40:49.368 --> 04:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
a hold of information to determine what
 
04:40:51.288 --> 04:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
costs the department would actually run
 
04:40:53.448 --> 04:40:53.458 align:start position:0%
into in terms of trying to administer
 
04:40:55.970 --> 04:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
this program that we're talking about
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
the EFA program to include all those
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
resources necessary to do this and can
 
04:41:05.090 --> 04:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
they do that cheaper than a contracted
 
04:41:06.650 --> 04:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
service that we presently have with the
 
04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship Organization no no thanks
 
04:41:10.490 --> 04:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for the for the
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
question and you know I would um I I
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't worked specifically
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
with the Department to figure that out
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
but my time on a school board has given
 
04:41:23.090 --> 04:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
me a lot of background and and eyes wide
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
open to what it actually costs to
 
04:41:28.730 --> 04:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
administer an educational program to um
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
to 3200 students which is smaller than
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Concord school district and um and
 
04:41:38.570 --> 04:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
so so you know I recognize that that
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
conquered the Concord School District uh
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't does not have a uh you
 
04:41:46.730 --> 04:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
know an extensive staff in the central
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
office to approve purchase orders and
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
review material expenses and budget
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
request items and PO requests that come
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the various staff they certainly
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
work up a budget every year as well and
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
present it to the uh the Concord school
 
04:42:05.090 --> 04:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
board for approval and are able to do
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
that within a um a budget that is is
 
04:42:11.570 --> 04:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
contained and supported by the the
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers here in Concord so so this is
 
04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
obviously we're zooming out Statewide
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
now for for the EFA program but but it's
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
still a relatively small number of
 
04:42:27.288 --> 04:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
students by School District size and if
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
the department of edu I'm sure the
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education could um could
 
04:42:35.448 --> 04:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
could could uh develop a a staffing plan
 
04:42:38.570 --> 04:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly to to be able to
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
perform these these administrative
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
functions we know that they developed
 
04:42:45.530 --> 04:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
rules for the the education Freedom
 
04:42:48.170 --> 04:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
program very very quickly because I
 
04:42:50.930 --> 04:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
think the the program was approved in
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
the uh by the biennial budget it that
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
was signed into law back and it was
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
probably the end of June 2021 and I
 
04:43:02.330 --> 04:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
think by September they had they had
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
rules before the uh before JL Carr so we
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
know the department can act very quickly
 
04:43:09.410 --> 04:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the education Freedom
 
04:43:11.208 --> 04:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
account program I have no reason to
 
04:43:13.610 --> 04:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
doubt that they wouldn't be able to act
 
04:43:16.128 --> 04:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
quickly in in this case as well so and
 
04:43:18.770 --> 04:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
follow up to my question then have you
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
gotten any information from the
 
04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to find out
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
what their actual costs are you know
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
we've talked 10 percent of
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
of it all however what are the actual
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
costs are they coming in underneath that
 
04:43:35.330 --> 04:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
and have you gotten any information to
 
04:43:37.850 --> 04:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
that effect or are they spending more
 
04:43:39.890 --> 04:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
than that 10 percent
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
I no I don't have that information
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's a great question Mr chair the I'm
 
04:43:46.730 --> 04:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
simply working with the legislation that
 
04:43:48.650 --> 04:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
establishes the program that says the
 
04:43:51.610 --> 04:43:51.620 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization can can can
 
04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
keep uh 10 for their their own purposes
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
in administering the program so uh so
 
04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know I'm I'm basically
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
taking a look at uh you know an
 
04:44:06.110 --> 04:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
organization that that um that was
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
awarded what what ultimately you know
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
over these first four years could be a
 
04:44:14.050 --> 04:44:14.060 align:start position:0%
90 million dollar contract in a no bid
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh vote on the executive Council
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's a private organization that's got a
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
current and former State Rep on their
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
board and uh and you know uh I while
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
they may be the only game in town uh
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
currently because I believe they were
 
04:44:34.850 --> 04:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
administrating the administering the tax
 
04:44:37.250 --> 04:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program too
 
04:44:40.610 --> 04:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and I and I don't know how the us of
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
this program relate to the cost of
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
administrating administering the tax
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program to see if
 
04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
they're comparable that may be something
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
that that we could smoke out a little
 
04:44:54.170 --> 04:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
bit but but again you know this is in
 
04:44:56.570 --> 04:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
this is in an effort of uh of
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability to the
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because ultimately the uh the
 
04:45:04.250 --> 04:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education through its
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner is accountable to the
 
04:45:07.730 --> 04:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through uh through the
 
04:45:07.740 --> 04:45:09.050 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through uh through the
governor

04:45:09.050 --> 04:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
further questions could I just yesterday
 
04:45:13.128 --> 04:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
question go ahead
 
04:45:14.208 --> 04:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
um law for both the EFA program and tax
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship is uh 10 for
 
04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
administration yeah
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
and we had discussed that when we passed
 
04:45:25.850 --> 04:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
a bill whether 10 percent well we
 
04:45:27.050 --> 04:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
chuckled that around a little bit
 
04:45:30.830 --> 04:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether it was too much or not enough so
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
that I think it might be worthwhile
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
while going back and looking at some of
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
that testimony we had representative
 
04:45:35.878 --> 04:45:37.250 align:start position:0%
that testimony we had representative
Tanner

04:45:37.250 --> 04:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
question and thanks to my new law book
 
04:45:45.368 --> 04:45:45.378 align:start position:0%
uh I'm able to on
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
21-9 colon 7-a is the freedom accounts
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
administrator position that we put in
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
place last year at the end of election
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
we've actually voted in last year and
 
04:45:58.730 --> 04:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
that position
 
04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
um within the division of the education
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
analytics and resources is a classified
 
04:46:06.410 --> 04:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
employee at no less than the level of
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
administrator too and then it goes on to
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
tell about how it's supposed to oversee
 
04:46:11.930 --> 04:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
the program
 
04:46:15.288 --> 04:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
um and uh provide coordinate and provide
 
04:46:17.930 --> 04:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to uh students
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
parents in the scholarship organizations
 
04:46:19.920 --> 04:46:21.948 align:start position:0%
parents in the scholarship organizations
plural

04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
plural
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
my question is do we know who has that
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
position uh in the Department of
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
Education right now or if it is filled
 
04:46:33.288 --> 04:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
at all and whether
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
um you know that's part of the 10 that
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization gets for
 
04:46:37.440 --> 04:46:40.128 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization gets for
administration

04:46:40.128 --> 04:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the uh the question
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I um I I sort of
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
suspect since that was that's in our law
 
04:46:49.368 --> 04:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
book and that the scholarship
 
04:46:51.890 --> 04:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
organization doesn't pay for that is
 
04:46:55.208 --> 04:46:55.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
it says that the position is it's
 
04:47:00.288 --> 04:47:00.298 align:start position:0%
established within the division of
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
education and analytics and um yeah at
 
04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
no less than the level of administrator
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
so that's a state that's a state
 
04:47:11.810 --> 04:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
employee yeah and um and so so uh so
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh that's a
 
04:47:16.970 --> 04:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded uh position and
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and I I I I I I don't think but I
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
certainly don't know that uh that that
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
that that the the scholarship
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization reimburses the Department
 
04:47:30.530 --> 04:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
of Education for that position I I don't
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
have any reason to believe that they
 
04:47:31.920 --> 04:47:33.050 align:start position:0%
have any reason to believe that they
would

04:47:33.050 --> 04:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
um uh you know if that's the you know if
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's one of the questions but but I
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
also am not aware I'm aware of that
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
position I'm not aware if that position
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
spend uh been filled represent cordelli
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh yes it's currently uh
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
not filled they had one hot one round of
 
04:47:57.288 --> 04:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
um submission of resumes
 
04:47:58.970 --> 04:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and interviews for the position and
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
ended up hiring none of those candidates
 
04:48:03.650 --> 04:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
and they have gone out for a second
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
round and I think that the due date is
 
04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
this week for a responses to that second
 
04:48:10.740 --> 04:48:12.410 align:start position:0%
this week for a responses to that second
round

04:48:12.410 --> 04:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
round
 
04:48:15.890 --> 04:48:15.900 align:start position:0%

about transparency it's all there and
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
they even have their financial
 
04:48:41.170 --> 04:48:41.180 align:start position:0%
statements are on the doe website
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
everything is there so my question is
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
what is it that you want to know
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%

so thanks very much uh for the for the
 
04:48:56.700 --> 04:48:57.948 align:start position:0%
so thanks very much uh for the for the

04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
and uh there's um there's a a dollar
 
04:49:21.000 --> 04:49:26.690 align:start position:0%
and uh there's um there's a a dollar
item

04:49:26.690 --> 04:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
computer hardware internet connectivity
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
and other technological services and
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
devices for five hundred and four
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't know what what these
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
things are how they're being used who's
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
using them uh where they were where they
 
04:49:45.170 --> 04:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
were purchased from uh there's also some
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
things that I think are more even more
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
opaque than um uh than that uh and just
 
04:49:53.690 --> 04:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
sort of going down here
 
04:49:53.700 --> 04:49:54.830 align:start position:0%
sort of going down here
um

04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
textbooks curriculum or other
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
instructional and supplemental materials
 
04:50:00.530 --> 04:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
or online instruction required by
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum or provider comma school
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
uniforms and you've got school uniforms
 
04:50:08.690 --> 04:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
actually in several places that are that
 
04:50:10.310 --> 04:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know or another place that's by
 
04:50:13.490 --> 04:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
itself so so some of these some of these
 
04:50:15.770 --> 04:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
spending categories they're they're
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
clearly I mean there's a lot of textbook
 
04:50:20.330 --> 04:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
seems to be everywhere tuition seems to
 
04:50:22.250 --> 04:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
be everywhere
 
04:50:22.260 --> 04:50:23.208 align:start position:0%
be everywhere
um

04:50:23.208 --> 04:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:23.218 --> 04:50:23.830 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:50:23.830 --> 04:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
various therapies I don't know what
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
those are I'm probably not the person to
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh to review them but but perhaps you
 
04:50:35.150 --> 04:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
know somebody that's an education expert
 
04:50:37.368 --> 04:50:37.378 align:start position:0%
to be able to look at these things look
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
at some of these purchases as opposed to
 
04:50:42.170 --> 04:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
the categories that a private contractor
 
04:50:45.170 --> 04:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
has put them into and say yeah you know
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not a um a good use of
 
04:50:50.448 --> 04:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars certainly I think the
 
04:50:52.250 --> 04:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
one of the examples we found in Arizona
 
04:50:56.330 --> 04:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
was was uh was one of the one of the
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
um some of the taxpayer money was used
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
to what by like a jet ski or something
 
04:51:04.730 --> 04:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
like that I don't know if a jet ski fits
 
04:51:07.128 --> 04:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
into any of these categories
 
04:51:08.810 --> 04:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
um or not you know if there's any of
 
04:51:10.850 --> 04:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
these categories that talk about other
 
04:51:14.170 --> 04:51:14.180 align:start position:0%
technological services or devices
 
04:51:17.628 --> 04:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
I just can't tell from this and I'm not
 
04:51:20.570 --> 04:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
saying that that again that I'm the
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
expert to be able to to do that but I
 
04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
think somebody that does have some
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
governance responsibility uh through uh
 
04:51:30.650 --> 04:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
through the department
 
04:51:33.770 --> 04:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
um to the governor would um would would
 
04:51:35.930 --> 04:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
you know clearly be in be in a chain of
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
accountability where the uh the current
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
um organization administering the
 
04:51:43.250 --> 04:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
program isn't
 
04:51:45.770 --> 04:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering um based on your
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
reading of some of those categories are
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
you looking for information I'm
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about privacy
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
um for the name of someone who is
 
04:51:59.330 --> 04:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
getting like physical therapy or
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
something and how much they paid for
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure what level
 
04:52:05.448 --> 04:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
um of information is missing that you're
 
04:52:07.250 --> 04:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
looking for no I'm not I'm not looking
 
04:52:08.810 --> 04:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
for that I'm not looking at anything
 
04:52:10.910 --> 04:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I think would be on what a
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee would be uh
 
04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
would be looking for in all that
 
04:52:17.570 --> 04:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
information is is subject to review by
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
any of us who um who who requests that
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
and my experience you know my experience
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
12 years on the hopping board I think
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's probably eight or nine or ten
 
04:52:30.770 --> 04:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
years as the board rep to the uh to the
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
budget committee budget committees
 
04:52:35.170 --> 04:52:35.180 align:start position:0%
review very detailed expense information
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
certainly personally identifiable
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
information is redacted from those
 
04:52:39.180 --> 04:52:40.550 align:start position:0%
information is redacted from those
reports

04:52:40.550 --> 04:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
um uh we did have a budget Committee
 
04:52:44.690 --> 04:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
Member years ago that actually wanted to
 
04:52:47.330 --> 04:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
to have the names of of people and I
 
04:52:50.030 --> 04:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
basically shut shut that line of
 
04:52:52.128 --> 04:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
discussion down so I absolutely agree
 
04:52:53.990 --> 04:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
with you representative cordelli that
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
that protection of this sensitive
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
information uh that's identifiable back
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
to a student is uh and a family is very
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
very important and I would not want to
 
04:53:05.570 --> 04:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
see the department
 
04:53:05.580 --> 04:53:06.350 align:start position:0%
see the department
um

04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:08.690 --> 04:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
um uh put and you know put any of these
 
04:53:12.170 --> 04:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
families in uh in a sensitive um uh
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
situation and uh and I think the
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
department has gone out of its way to
 
04:53:17.280 --> 04:53:18.530 align:start position:0%
department has gone out of its way to
protect

04:53:18.530 --> 04:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
protect
 
04:53:22.368 --> 04:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
um uh students and families who are in a
 
04:53:24.170 --> 04:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
school district where there may be a
 
04:53:26.410 --> 04:53:26.420 align:start position:0%
small number of students with certain
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
special needs conditions and um and and
 
04:53:32.288 --> 04:53:32.298 align:start position:0%
being able to mask out that information
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know so I I you know I I
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect the department would do
 
04:53:41.410 --> 04:53:41.420 align:start position:0%
any differently with with this data
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd just like to
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
rewind for a moment to a point that was
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
made regarding the that perhaps
 
04:53:52.730 --> 04:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
administrative cost of this program
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
could be as high as 25 because they're
 
04:53:57.410 --> 04:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
essentially doubled between the the
 
04:54:00.770 --> 04:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
schools and the the program itself but
 
04:54:02.410 --> 04:54:02.420 align:start position:0%
to get to the bill
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
we we don't know as of right now what it
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
would cost in administrative fees to
 
04:54:11.090 --> 04:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
move this from a scholarship program to
 
04:54:13.730 --> 04:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and in
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
either case I don't see anywhere in this
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
bill that the administrative costs
 
04:54:20.690 --> 04:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
associated with private schools are
 
04:54:23.208 --> 04:54:23.218 align:start position:0%
affected whatsoever could you could you
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
walk me through how this bill might
 
04:54:27.890 --> 04:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
offset or lower or prevent that doubling
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
of administrative costs so so no that's
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
a good question it certainly wouldn't
 
04:54:33.410 --> 04:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
reduce the administrative costs
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
associated with private schools
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
um should the program should the
 
04:54:40.610 --> 04:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
administration the program move over to
 
04:54:43.550 --> 04:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
the department there'd certainly be a a
 
04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
another level of inefficiency in there
 
04:54:49.010 --> 04:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm granting you that I don't think
 
04:54:51.770 --> 04:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
it would be ten percent of the the
 
04:54:55.368 --> 04:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
program costs because if um if 10 Over a
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
four-year period is is nine million nine
 
04:55:00.288 --> 04:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
um that um that you know that's that's a
 
04:55:07.010 --> 04:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
lot of that's a lot of Staffing and and
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
I and I don't think it it takes somebody
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
with too much business experience or too
 
04:55:14.208 --> 04:55:14.218 align:start position:0%
much school board experience to realize
 
04:55:18.050 --> 04:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
that that that that that a program that
 
04:55:21.650 --> 04:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
that that has 3 200 kids in it doesn't
 
04:55:21.660 --> 04:55:23.030 align:start position:0%
that that has 3 200 kids in it doesn't
require

04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
that much uh you know Administration to
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh to particularly when you're not
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
actually administrating the the
 
04:55:34.010 --> 04:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
development of you know you know your
 
04:55:34.020 --> 04:55:34.850 align:start position:0%
development of you know you know your
your

04:55:34.850 --> 04:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:55:36.650 --> 04:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
according to these expenses some of them
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
are buying off-the-shelf curriculum
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
certainly paying tuition at private
 
04:55:42.050 --> 04:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
schools you're not administering the
 
04:55:43.850 --> 04:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
private school they're doing that
 
04:55:46.128 --> 04:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
themselves they're administering the
 
04:55:48.590 --> 04:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
payment to the uh to the private school
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
and that interface with the with the
 
04:55:51.000 --> 04:55:52.010 align:start position:0%
and that interface with the with the
student

04:55:52.010 --> 04:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:55:54.190 --> 04:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
um uh there's just
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
if yeah there's I I don't think it takes
 
04:55:59.810 --> 04:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
much to to think that the department
 
04:56:01.970 --> 04:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
could uh could do that maybe more
 
04:56:04.010 --> 04:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
efficiently thank you uh representative
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
are we making some decision share based
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
upon a sheep that might be a summary or
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
not certainly it's not the way we would
 
04:56:14.810 --> 04:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
do our Municipal accounting with the
 
04:56:16.490 --> 04:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and the object codes and
 
04:56:18.650 --> 04:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
all that numbers and all that on it for
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
certain categories it doesn't look to me
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
like this has this but what I understood
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
there was a a program which scholarship
 
04:56:29.330 --> 04:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
organization had purchased that would do
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
all that I don't think we're looking at
 
04:56:35.208 --> 04:56:35.218 align:start position:0%
that program here and so
 
04:56:38.690 --> 04:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
well hold on well so so this is the
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
information that's available on the the
 
04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
department website so I think you might
 
04:56:44.570 --> 04:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
be referred was there a program called
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
like digital wallet or something class
 
04:56:46.798 --> 04:56:48.050 align:start position:0%
like digital wallet or something class
wallet

04:56:48.050 --> 04:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
wallet
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I haven't seen that information
 
04:56:54.410 --> 04:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
where where where you know actual POS
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
and and you know uh um you know purchase
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
order to Amazon for uh you know Windows
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
laptop or something something like that
 
04:57:07.550 --> 04:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know what we're what we're seeing
 
04:57:10.610 --> 04:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
here is Amazon is the largest vendor and
 
04:57:12.890 --> 04:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
we're seeing computer devices being the
 
04:57:14.208 --> 04:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
third or fourth
 
04:57:18.170 --> 04:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
um uh biggest cost or you know uh yeah
 
04:57:20.690 --> 04:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
yeah but you know
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
um mechanical Pro you know being it's
 
04:57:25.150 --> 04:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
not broken down by
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
departments or no it's not or specific
 
04:57:31.010 --> 04:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
areas like Administration you know
 
04:57:32.570 --> 04:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah that's right and
 
04:57:34.368 --> 04:57:34.378 align:start position:0%
that's it may be available Yeah well
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah but but I haven't seen it available
 
04:57:38.810 --> 04:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
on anything that's that's been been
 
04:57:40.430 --> 04:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
pointed in my direction and and
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
certainly all of our times on school
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
boards and budget committees we're
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with our inch thick annual
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
reports that we um that we present to to
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
our our you know the our voters in town
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
during um uh school district and annual
 
04:57:59.090 --> 04:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
um annual meetings and the doe 25 that's
 
04:58:00.890 --> 04:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
laid out in there and the audit report
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's laid out uh in there in the
 
04:58:05.810 --> 04:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
detailed budget requests that get right
 
04:58:07.730 --> 04:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
down in the line line by line what are
 
04:58:10.850 --> 04:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
you requesting an 1100 1200 1300 uh
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
which are the big the big lines in a in
 
04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
a school budget and uh and then the
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
detailed I mean we've had budget
 
04:58:21.770 --> 04:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee members request five inch fix
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
printouts of of detailed line by line
 
04:58:25.080 --> 04:58:26.330 align:start position:0%
printouts of of detailed line by line
line

04:58:26.330 --> 04:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
um Rick I mean I don't know what
 
04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to do going through all
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
of that but but certainly that would be
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
something that that uh that a department
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
would be able that the Department of
 
04:58:38.930 --> 04:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
Education would be able to use to uh to
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
audit a program
 
04:58:43.490 --> 04:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative yes I have an answer
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
to those
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
um the doe does have all of that the
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
Auditors had all of that it's a huge
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it has every single but it
 
04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
also has the students names all of that
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
stuff which as you said are a privacy
 
04:58:58.730 --> 04:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
issues so they couldn't put that out on
 
04:59:01.610 --> 04:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
the website but the Auditors had all of
 
04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
that information line by line every
 
04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
single purchase and exactly what it was
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
for and the doe has that it's a huge
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet we the public don't have
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
that we you know because that includes
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
all kinds of personal identifying
 
04:59:18.650 --> 04:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
information and that's why we don't have
 
04:59:21.770 --> 04:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
it but and it was meant to be easier to
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
read if we had the categories as opposed
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
to every single computer because like
 
04:59:29.470 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
you said pages I mean that's an 18 page
 
04:59:33.050 --> 04:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
report as it is and it would be an inch
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
thick and we don't each need an inch
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
thick but that information is there it's
 
04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
all tracked the Auditors had every penny
 
04:59:42.650 --> 04:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
spent and the doe has that information I
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
would be very concerned with a any kind
 
04:59:47.090 --> 04:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
of an audit or performance audit or they
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
had student names in it right I wouldn't
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
accept that I don't think that's an
 
04:59:54.530 --> 04:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
issue of transparency I think that if
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to use like a unique people
 
04:59:57.530 --> 04:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
identifier or something like that other
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
than the student's name
 
05:00:01.368 --> 05:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
um we gotta be very careful yeah yeah
 
05:00:03.770 --> 05:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
and and and uh
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know along those same lines um Mr
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
chair I think the department should um
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
when when getting these reports from the
 
05:00:14.170 --> 05:00:14.180 align:start position:0%
uh the private contractor
 
05:00:17.930 --> 05:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
should should make sure that there's no
 
05:00:19.970 --> 05:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information in
 
05:00:22.730 --> 05:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
these reports the same way our school
 
05:00:24.890 --> 05:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
districts make these reports available
 
05:00:26.810 --> 05:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
to budget committees with that
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
information removed my concern right now
 
05:00:31.550 --> 05:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
and it's not a question that is that we
 
05:00:33.050 --> 05:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
have a lot of conjecture going on here
 
05:00:36.170 --> 05:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
right now and we have not seen this
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
information we're talking about so I I
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
think we've got to be very very careful
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
05:00:45.170 --> 05:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
I agree other questions representative
 
05:00:46.970 --> 05:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
um for a second drawing the focus back
 
05:00:51.410 --> 05:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
to page two line 26 which is the
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
Statewide student assessments and it's a
 
05:00:56.208 --> 05:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
two-part question how would you address
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that this is duplicative of
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
students attending chartered public
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
schools that use efas for additional
 
05:01:05.090 --> 05:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
support maybe an outside tutor who are
 
05:01:07.550 --> 05:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
already required by as it's writing RSA
 
05:01:10.250 --> 05:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
190 for a c to take the Statewide exam
 
05:01:12.530 --> 05:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is
 
05:01:14.330 --> 05:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
would you address the concern that this
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
is an additional burden on private
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
schools who do not ordinarily provide
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Statewide assessment to all students
 
05:01:21.948 --> 05:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
or home schools as well so no thanks for
 
05:01:23.208 --> 05:01:23.218 align:start position:0%
the question I think that's a I think
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I think the to the
 
05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
first part of that I don't think it
 
05:01:29.208 --> 05:01:29.218 align:start position:0%
would be duplicative I think you know
 
05:01:30.650 --> 05:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
you do it for one or the other and it
 
05:01:32.930 --> 05:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
covers the the requirement in both you
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to take the state assessment
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
twice to the second part private schools
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
are offered as we've we've heard this
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
week last week are offered by the
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
department should they should they wish
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
to uh where students can take the the
 
05:01:51.050 --> 05:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment so so it's not um
 
05:01:53.690 --> 05:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's not you know opening the door
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
to something that doesn't exist already
 
05:02:01.368 --> 05:02:01.378 align:start position:0%
in in law and um and uh you know they
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
don't they certainly don't have to do it
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
for all their students because there's
 
05:02:07.368 --> 05:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
no law that says says that but for uh
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
for students who are having their
 
05:02:12.050 --> 05:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
tuition paid for by public taxpayers I
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
think there is an accountability
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
um uh back to the uh the taxpayer and um
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and should a should a family say no
 
05:02:24.050 --> 05:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
we don't want to we don't want to
 
05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
um subject our our student to a
 
05:02:27.890 --> 05:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment then you know what
 
05:02:29.930 --> 05:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
they they can they they don't they don't
 
05:02:31.550 --> 05:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
have to be part of the education Freedom
 
05:02:33.050 --> 05:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
account program
 
05:02:35.208 --> 05:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
um obviously you know it only existed up
 
05:02:38.570 --> 05:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
to two years you know two years ago so
 
05:02:40.750 --> 05:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know they could you know
 
05:02:43.448 --> 05:02:43.458 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly do it without
 
05:02:46.610 --> 05:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so again with these
 
05:02:48.170 --> 05:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
students if they're in a private school
 
05:02:50.570 --> 05:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
and that school doesn't ordinarily offer
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
it of course they can that seems to be
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
an additional burden on that school but
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
more importantly on the student who
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
might be singled out from their
 
05:02:59.090 --> 05:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
classmates saying You must take this
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
exam well their classmates can continue
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
with other scheduled curriculum so how
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
is it so that these students aren't
 
05:03:07.250 --> 05:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
singled out and that it's not oh this
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
student's a part of the freedom account
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
program and the other students shouldn't
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
know that information like you said
 
05:03:13.730 --> 05:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
these personal identifiable
 
05:03:15.470 --> 05:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
characteristics or how is that prevented
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
if they are required to take this yeah
 
05:03:19.550 --> 05:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good question
 
05:03:21.650 --> 05:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
um I think State assessments were
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
actually being done online during during
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
a couple a couple years I think I'd
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
heard that so there may be ways to uh to
 
05:03:33.288 --> 05:03:33.298 align:start position:0%
to uh to get that get those performance
 
05:03:36.410 --> 05:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
indicators in a way that that doesn't
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't single out the the
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
student publicly but I certainly uh I
 
05:03:43.490 --> 05:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
certainly share your your concern there
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
but I think there's probably a solution
 
05:03:48.650 --> 05:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh to that that could exist outside of
 
05:03:50.690 --> 05:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
law specifying I think it's also
 
05:03:52.850 --> 05:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
important to remember that that you know
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
that that uh statutes end up becoming a
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
framework we don't necessarily you know
 
05:04:00.170 --> 05:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know the statute doesn't necessarily
 
05:04:04.010 --> 05:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
specify every every last little item uh
 
05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
there is rulemaking Authority on the
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
part of the um the Department of
 
05:04:12.410 --> 05:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
Education for under 190 uh what the
 
05:04:15.530 --> 05:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
statute are we in 194 f
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh I believe there's rule making I
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
know there's rule making Authority Under
 
05:04:23.150 --> 05:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
194f so so the department would able
 
05:04:25.610 --> 05:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
would be able to uh promulgate
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
um you know rules through jail to
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
address that thank you
 
05:04:30.650 --> 05:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
we're gonna I'm gonna allow a couple
 
05:04:34.128 --> 05:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
more questions uh of the presenter we do
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
have another very important bill that's
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
right on top of us here coming up
 
05:04:41.448 --> 05:04:41.458 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get to that uh go ahead
 
05:04:41.458 --> 05:04:43.730 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get to that uh go ahead
representative

05:04:43.730 --> 05:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you obviously there's a lot of
 
05:04:46.920 --> 05:04:47.628 align:start position:0%
thank you obviously there's a lot of
um

05:04:47.628 --> 05:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:49.670 --> 05:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the word accountable
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
and trans transparency and just want to
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
do a little education before I ask you
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
my question in regards to this bill if I
 
05:04:57.240 --> 05:04:58.490 align:start position:0%
my question in regards to this bill if I
may

05:04:58.490 --> 05:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:05:00.890 --> 05:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
um accountability is if you're getting
 
05:05:02.330 --> 05:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
money and you're going to these
 
05:05:04.730 --> 05:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
retailers of BJ's and Costco's to buy
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
snacks for your child
 
05:05:09.050 --> 05:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
or you're buying ballet slippers for
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
someone at a ballet school valid very
 
05:05:11.878 --> 05:05:12.830 align:start position:0%
someone at a ballet school valid very
valid

05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
valid
 
05:05:15.170 --> 05:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
if that money is coming out of my own
 
05:05:17.390 --> 05:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
personal budget I'm accountable for that
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
but when my property taxes are given to
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
someone to go purchase that when
 
05:05:25.730 --> 05:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
somebody not on a freedom account has to
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
buy it out of their own budget
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
I ask you where is that fair
 
05:05:33.410 --> 05:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
and to give an example accounting
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
manuals and I think you mentioned it
 
05:05:38.750 --> 05:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the accountability of this
 
05:05:40.610 --> 05:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
financial report
 
05:05:42.530 --> 05:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
all public schools have an accounts
 
05:05:44.208 --> 05:05:44.218 align:start position:0%
payable Clerk
 
05:05:47.208 --> 05:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
in every expense which includes the
 
05:05:50.810 --> 05:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
number of that item the vendor who's it
 
05:05:53.930 --> 05:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
for why is it for why does it need to be
 
05:05:56.810 --> 05:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
replaced what's the per unit cost and
 
05:05:58.730 --> 05:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
the total cost
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
and that those items are put into a
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
manifest the financial manifest given to
 
05:06:06.850 --> 05:06:06.860 align:start position:0%
all the public school boards to approve
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
every individual expense and vendor
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
before you can spend that money
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
and a school board member
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
can say
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
nope we're not buying
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
um something for the music department no
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're not buying it so you have to pull
 
05:06:28.430 --> 05:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
that and you're not buying it that's
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
public transparency because your board
 
05:06:34.010 --> 05:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
members are elected officials elected to
 
05:06:37.490 --> 05:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
represent your whole community and so
 
05:06:39.170 --> 05:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
there's a difference in transparency
 
05:06:41.628 --> 05:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
there and I think that's what your bill
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
is focusing on is to make sure I mean
 
05:06:48.050 --> 05:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
this final financial report is horrible
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
it has no number of textbooks what kind
 
05:06:53.868 --> 05:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
are they who are they for same for
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
anything else on that list and then the
 
05:06:58.490 --> 05:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
the accountability fact sheet doesn't
 
05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
even have the same information on year
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
one as it does on year two
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and I'm getting to my question though
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
if the department of Ed were to overtake
 
05:07:13.610 --> 05:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
this project it already sounds from what
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli says there'll be
 
05:07:17.930 --> 05:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
a staff person so that shouldn't be an
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
issue but I want to know all of these
 
05:07:23.390 --> 05:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
reports and I have about 22 of them that
 
05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
a public school is accountable for for
 
05:07:28.490 --> 05:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
transparency which includes school
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
safety asbestos management Emergency
 
05:07:34.270 --> 05:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
Management plans air quality assessment
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%

05:07:39.070 --> 05:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
progress student growth
 
05:07:42.410 --> 05:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
I have at least 22. how about the doe 25
 
05:07:45.288 --> 05:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
which is extremely thorough
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
and time consuming yeah I know you're
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
like they need to redo that one too
 
05:07:53.930 --> 05:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
right but that is transparency that
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
tells every taxpayer in my neighborhood
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
on what the dollar that was collected
 
05:08:02.448 --> 05:08:02.458 align:start position:0%
from their pocket is being spent on
 
05:08:04.430 --> 05:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
whether they like it or not that's why
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
you have public meetings so I think
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's a little education that needs to
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
be done it's not pro how you're
 
05:08:12.650 --> 05:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
educating Kids versus they all got to go
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
to public because I I don't believe that
 
05:08:17.448 --> 05:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
but when my property tax dollars are
 
05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
personal choice questions and it doesn't
 
05:08:26.208 --> 05:08:26.218 align:start position:0%
get reported out that's the sin so my
 
05:08:30.050 --> 05:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
question is sorry is if if this pass so
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the department person that we're
 
05:08:33.770 --> 05:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
hiring for
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
efas would they be accountable for all
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
the same reporting public reportings
 
05:08:43.490 --> 05:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
that are in I platform all of those data
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
reports I mean would you expect that to
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
occur so that there would be
 
05:08:52.090 --> 05:08:52.100 align:start position:0%
transparency and I think that would
 
05:08:55.850 --> 05:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
truly strengthen what people are trying
 
05:08:57.890 --> 05:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
to do yeah no thank thank you very much
 
05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
Dr cascadden and and I think your
 
05:09:03.288 --> 05:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
explanation of how transparency and
 
05:09:06.050 --> 05:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
accountability go hand in hand is
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
important because it's hard to have
 
05:09:09.650 --> 05:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
accountability if you don't have
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
transparency in place where taxpayers
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
can see how their money is being spent
 
05:09:17.810 --> 05:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
and then can can make a decision in the
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
voting booth as Oppo you know in terms
 
05:09:22.190 --> 05:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
of who they want representing them
 
05:09:25.250 --> 05:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
making these policy decisions
 
05:09:29.090 --> 05:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and and the the oversight element as
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
well is very important and
 
05:09:33.170 --> 05:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli laid out how uh
 
05:09:36.050 --> 05:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
how there is there there was a bill that
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
um that uh that passed uh uh last year
 
05:09:41.930 --> 05:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
that I think representative fellows had
 
05:09:45.190 --> 05:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
had introduced that that actually does
 
05:09:48.530 --> 05:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
have a uh have an oversight audit
 
05:09:52.368 --> 05:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight audit of the um uh
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the education Freedom account program
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't begin I think until 2024 2025
 
05:10:01.610 --> 05:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
it it so so
 
05:10:03.770 --> 05:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
um uh so we haven't we haven't seen that
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
yet but it's hard to have oversight when
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have transparency when you
 
05:10:12.650 --> 05:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't have the data there to um uh to to
 
05:10:17.090 --> 05:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
look at and um and
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I get the the rest of
 
05:10:23.930 --> 05:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
what you what you asked about Korean
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
College of state reports
 
05:10:28.550 --> 05:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
provide the ms-25 to the Dr right
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:38.570 --> 05:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm not again I'm not I'm not
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill this bill is not the bill
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
that that that requires all of that
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
reporting uh in there but um but it
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be a start to have the department
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
be able to collect and and and collect
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
that information review that information
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
make that information
 
05:11:10.010 --> 05:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
um uh transparent to taxpayers in a way
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
that protects
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
um uh student and family identity just
 
05:11:16.970 --> 05:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
the same way school districts do when
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
presenting that information to budget
 
05:11:19.730 --> 05:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
committees and presenting that
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
information to voters uh and um
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh and it it it it really moves I think
 
05:11:28.690 --> 05:11:28.700 align:start position:0%
the the program in the right direction
 
05:11:33.050 --> 05:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
to uh to not have a level of of worry
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
and and suspicion because we just don't
 
05:11:40.128 --> 05:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
know how um how money is being spent
 
05:11:41.690 --> 05:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%

representative from Manchester and I'm
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
delighted to um uh to to have the
 
05:14:06.890 --> 05:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this uh the chair
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
chair lad and I were involved in a um
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee last year year
 
05:14:17.330 --> 05:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
before last year on on specifically this
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh this item and and uh
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and and it's important for um uh for
 
05:14:25.010 --> 05:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
this committee it's important for uh for
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
people all across uh the state and
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'll briefly tell you why and then and
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
then I think turn it over too well we
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
have several other people here we have
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services here in
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the Manchester school boards here also
 
05:14:41.930 --> 05:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
okay and I and I also um I I I believe
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh Mark manginello is going to also be
 
05:14:47.930 --> 05:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
here for technical advice but uh but we
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
may be I think we're probably covered we
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
also have this bill set up for our work
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
session in the following and that may be
 
05:14:57.770 --> 05:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
that may be the yeah yeah here we go so
 
05:14:59.570 --> 05:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
perfect so
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 601 is actually it it
 
05:15:06.288 --> 05:15:06.298 align:start position:0%
it it sounds relatively
 
05:15:09.650 --> 05:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
um you know you know benign in terms of
 
05:15:12.410 --> 05:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of what it's asking to to do
 
05:15:14.690 --> 05:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
but it has very important
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
um um manifestations uh in a couple of
 
05:15:20.208 --> 05:15:20.218 align:start position:0%
different areas that are important to um
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers families and students all
 
05:15:24.890 --> 05:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill is uh relative to
 
05:15:30.890 --> 05:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
participation in the Medicaid direct
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
certification program for free and
 
05:15:35.208 --> 05:15:35.218 align:start position:0%
produced uh free and reduced price
 
05:15:39.170 --> 05:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
School meals so the 300 free and reduced
 
05:15:41.030 --> 05:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
price lunch program or School Meal
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
program is uh I think um we all know
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
part of the national school lunch
 
05:15:49.010 --> 05:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
program administered by the uh United
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
States Department of Agriculture and it
 
05:15:54.430 --> 05:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
basically and and
 
05:15:57.288 --> 05:15:57.298 align:start position:0%
Mr manchinello can can probably explain
 
05:16:01.250 --> 05:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
the the mechanics behind this uh it
 
05:16:04.250 --> 05:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
basically provides federal funds to um
 
05:16:05.448 --> 05:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
you know through the Department of
 
05:16:09.650 --> 05:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
Education to school districts who make
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
meals available on a free and reduced
 
05:16:16.010 --> 05:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
price basis to uh to students so prior
 
05:16:19.490 --> 05:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
to um prior to the pandemic and uh and
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
represent lad I'd really appreciate you
 
05:16:23.570 --> 05:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
jumping in it with the numbers because I
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
meant to fill in a couple blanks and I
 
05:16:27.530 --> 05:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
just never got a chance to but prior to
 
05:16:30.890 --> 05:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
the pandemic I think we had about 48 000
 
05:16:30.900 --> 05:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
the pandemic I think we had about 48 000
45

05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
45
 
05:16:34.430 --> 05:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
000 48 000 students in the free and
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch program Mark will be
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to give us that almost exactly so
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
and it but it was it was something
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
something in that range
 
05:16:48.170 --> 05:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
um and um uh but but even that number
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually reflect the number of
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
students across the state who would be
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
eligible at 185 percent of the federal
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
poverty level who would be eligible for
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
to participate in the free and reduce
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
light price lunch program so it's
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
already an underrepresented number and
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
05:17:12.050 --> 05:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
you know and and I think we've probably
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
all heard you know anecdotal references
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
from school building principles
 
05:17:18.240 --> 05:17:19.190 align:start position:0%
from school building principles
um

05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the chair has has mentioned it a
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
couple times based on his experience in
 
05:17:27.530 --> 05:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
in public education that that sometimes
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's like pulling teeth to get uh to get
 
05:17:32.930 --> 05:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
a student to return a free and reduced
 
05:17:34.610 --> 05:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
price lunch
 
05:17:36.650 --> 05:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
um uh application to be able to
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
participate in the program
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh and yeah there can be a number
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
of different reasons behind that either
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
the paperwork doesn't get delivered home
 
05:17:45.590 --> 05:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
or they never got the paperwork to begin
 
05:17:47.810 --> 05:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
with or they didn't feel like writing
 
05:17:49.070 --> 05:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
down all the thing or they just wanted
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
to be private and not not go into it but
 
05:17:53.810 --> 05:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
anyway the number the number really
 
05:17:56.810 --> 05:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't reflect the um the
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
actual eligibility uh
 
05:18:02.448 --> 05:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
from these low-income households across
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the state and um and uh you know
 
05:18:11.570 --> 05:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
but since the pandemic and and this is
 
05:18:14.590 --> 05:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
where I think it really has has has
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
impacted uh students and and primarily
 
05:18:19.850 --> 05:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
students for now
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
um the um the number of the the well
 
05:18:24.890 --> 05:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic the Department of
 
05:18:27.530 --> 05:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
Agriculture issued waivers to local
 
05:18:29.090 --> 05:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
school districts so that they didn't
 
05:18:31.368 --> 05:18:31.378 align:start position:0%
have to collect free and reduced price
 
05:18:33.288 --> 05:18:33.298 align:start position:0%
lunch application forms for students
 
05:18:37.010 --> 05:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
everybody be eligible so uh so uh so
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
kids I think in most schools got free
 
05:18:38.878 --> 05:18:40.250 align:start position:0%
kids I think in most schools got free
lunches

05:18:40.250 --> 05:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
lunches
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um uh during the during the pandemic and
 
05:18:46.430 --> 05:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and didn't have to submit any any
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork and uh and now so they we've
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
got that inertia built into the system
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
where where paperwork just isn't being
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
returned to do this and I think now
 
05:18:59.690 --> 05:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
looking at the um the doe numbers and
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 35 five thousand students or
 
05:19:04.250 --> 05:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
something right around there so you know
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
off by you know off by almost you know
 
05:19:11.090 --> 05:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
twenty percent or so uh from from where
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
we were pre-pandemic and so what does
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
that mean well for families it means
 
05:19:17.110 --> 05:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:19:20.090 --> 05:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
they need to they you know some families
 
05:19:22.610 --> 05:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
are going to need to be spending you
 
05:19:25.610 --> 05:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
know 25 or 30 dollars a week maybe forty
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
or fifty dollars a week on breakfast and
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
lunch programs where they'd be eligible
 
05:19:31.610 --> 05:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
instead for free
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
um a free meal and uh and these are
 
05:19:36.770 --> 05:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
these are low income families to um to
 
05:19:40.010 --> 05:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
begin with and um
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
maybe these kids are going without
 
05:19:42.718 --> 05:19:43.250 align:start position:0%
maybe these kids are going without
um

05:19:43.250 --> 05:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
you know without lunch without breakfast
 
05:19:48.170 --> 05:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
I you know I don't know
 
05:19:50.570 --> 05:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
um but uh but in any case they're not
 
05:19:53.570 --> 05:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the um the access to
 
05:19:54.770 --> 05:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
the federal fund through the federal
 
05:19:58.010 --> 05:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
funds program to uh to support their um
 
05:20:00.410 --> 05:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
their their meals during the uh during
 
05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
the school day
 
05:20:06.288 --> 05:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
um and um and and I you know another you
 
05:20:07.930 --> 05:20:07.940 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to get this information
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
out to families but today uh today I
 
05:20:14.448 --> 05:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
think schools are very much up to speed
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
with electronic point of sale uh systems
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that it's not kids reaching into
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
their pocket for a five dollar bill and
 
05:20:25.070 --> 05:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
giving it to the lunch lunch person and
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
them ringing it up and then the next kid
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
in line oh that's okay Dave you're
 
05:20:31.128 --> 05:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
you're free and reduced you can you know
 
05:20:32.810 --> 05:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
just go right through no reaching into
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
the pocket you know for cash they're
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
cashless they're using their student ID
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to swipe through
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
um in some cases debits at five bucks in
 
05:20:43.550 --> 05:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
other cases it just goes right through
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
and um uh because they're a member of
 
05:20:47.690 --> 05:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
the program so so I think you know we
 
05:20:49.490 --> 05:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
were talking about student privacy
 
05:20:51.410 --> 05:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
earlier that's important I think school
 
05:20:53.090 --> 05:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
districts have really upgraded their
 
05:20:55.970 --> 05:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
systems to um uh to do that
 
05:20:55.980 --> 05:21:00.590 align:start position:0%
systems to um uh to do that
um

05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 601
 
05:21:08.090 --> 05:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
um by by by passing this would allow the
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh would actually direct the Department
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Education to participate in a program
 
05:21:15.650 --> 05:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's now a pilot program being offered
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
by the department I think it's the
 
05:21:20.448 --> 05:21:20.458 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to uh to use
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
um or maybe dhh in conjunction with DHHS
 
05:21:25.250 --> 05:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
right you're right yeah SDA yeah
 
05:21:28.690 --> 05:21:28.700 align:start position:0%
um to um to use Medicaid data
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
to qualify students for free and reduced
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
price lunch and it can be done
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
automatically and um in fact it can be
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
just done automatically no paperwork
 
05:21:39.480 --> 05:21:41.090 align:start position:0%
just done automatically no paperwork
required

05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
um no no hassle on the part of the
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
student on the family it happens privacy
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
is protected this is data that the state
 
05:21:52.550 --> 05:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
has already already has
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh and um and we'd be able to use it
 
05:21:57.890 --> 05:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
because 601 would would direct the
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
department to work with um with with our
 
05:22:00.840 --> 05:22:01.490 align:start position:0%
department to work with um with with our
other

05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:22:03.530 --> 05:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
um uh Health and Human Services in New
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to um to rely on to
 
05:22:09.530 --> 05:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
use this data uh to um identify the
 
05:22:11.448 --> 05:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
students who qualify for free surprise
 
05:22:13.250 --> 05:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
lunch it's good for families good for
 
05:22:13.260 --> 05:22:13.970 align:start position:0%
lunch it's good for families good for
kids

05:22:13.970 --> 05:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:22:16.490 --> 05:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
good for student outcomes you know we
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
heard the connection that you know when
 
05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
kids are fueled up they they do better
 
05:22:24.110 --> 05:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
in class too so um so but uh but there's
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
another important factor too
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of the state's
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant is tied to the number of
 
05:22:35.690 --> 05:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch students a
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
district has and it's significant
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
um it's um
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
Mark can tell you the number I just
 
05:22:44.330 --> 05:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
don't have it off the top let me explain
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
how FY 19 we have to back off to FY 19
 
05:22:50.208 --> 05:22:50.218 align:start position:0%
to figure out because of that period of
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
time where we work and how that
 
05:22:56.090 --> 05:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
identifies poverty and all the
 
05:22:59.330 --> 05:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
association figures so so so the state
 
05:23:01.730 --> 05:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire used in its adequacy
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
formula so now we're at 198.40a
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
um 198 colon 40a and um and it uses
 
05:23:12.250 --> 05:23:12.260 align:start position:0%
pre-introduced price launch in the
 
05:23:17.150 --> 05:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula as a proxy for um um
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
for students who come from for the
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of students that come from
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
low-income families it's not perfect
 
05:23:24.410 --> 05:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's not great but it's the best we we
 
05:23:27.410 --> 05:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
had uh until now in uh in New Hampshire
 
05:23:31.788 --> 05:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
and um and there's there's strong data
 
05:23:34.128 --> 05:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
that suggests and the state of New
 
05:23:36.590 --> 05:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has embraced this connection
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
for decades now that um that that it
 
05:23:43.970 --> 05:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
caught cost more to edu for district to
 
05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
educate all their students when there's
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
a higher number of students that come
 
05:23:51.230 --> 05:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
from low-income families than in a
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
district where there's very few students
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
then come from low-income families so
 
05:23:56.930 --> 05:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's not a personal thing like it costs
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
more to educate Dave luno because he
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
comes from a low-income family you know
 
05:24:03.530 --> 05:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
than it does Mel Miller because he
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not that it's it's a it's a
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
whole district-wide cost so when the
 
05:24:11.570 --> 05:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
when the when the when the free and
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch student count Falls
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
so does the state adequacy Grant to uh
 
05:24:20.690 --> 05:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
to school districts used that the school
 
05:24:24.250 --> 05:24:24.260 align:start position:0%
districts use to educate all their kids
 
05:24:26.750 --> 05:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean their budget's any lower it
 
05:24:28.850 --> 05:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean their costs are less but it
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
does mean that that they get less money
 
05:24:32.930 --> 05:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
from the state and we know when you get
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
less money from the state you get more
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
money from the local property taxpayers
 
05:24:39.170 --> 05:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:24:40.610 --> 05:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
you know and that's something that's
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's particularly hard on uh on you
 
05:24:47.090 --> 05:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
know so many cities and towns um all
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire so so bottom line
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
is and I'll hand it over to the
 
05:24:54.890 --> 05:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
technical experts is that uh 601 allows
 
05:24:57.050 --> 05:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
us to automate the process be better
 
05:25:00.530 --> 05:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
reflective of the um of the the students
 
05:25:02.770 --> 05:25:02.780 align:start position:0%
and where they go to school
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
who qualify for free who are basically
 
05:25:07.970 --> 05:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
qualified for free and reduced price
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
lunch and um and
 
05:25:13.730 --> 05:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that those students are
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
getting the the federal benefit that
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
that they need saving their families uh
 
05:25:22.250 --> 05:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands I mean thousands
 
05:25:24.770 --> 05:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
of dollars a year you know across the
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
state and number two making sure
 
05:25:29.930 --> 05:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
districts are getting the resources that
 
05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
that they're owed from the uh from the
 
05:25:34.610 --> 05:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire based on the uh
 
05:25:36.890 --> 05:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
the the low income
 
05:25:39.770 --> 05:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
um you know concentration that that they
 
05:25:42.050 --> 05:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
face obviously it varies widely places
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
like now I almost pointing over
 
05:25:46.610 --> 05:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell so Manchester has
 
05:25:49.570 --> 05:25:49.580 align:start position:0%
a has I think one of the highest
 
05:25:53.690 --> 05:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
low-income uh uh you know low economic
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
populations in the state but it's all
 
05:25:58.850 --> 05:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
over the state they certainly have the
 
05:26:01.850 --> 05:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
highest number but but North Country all
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
across the state there's places that
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't but that's why we've got a dynamic
 
05:26:08.270 --> 05:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
school funding formula that takes into
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
account that this will help to automate
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
that process be fair for families and
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you very much
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
so I just want to clarify and make sure
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this correctly
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and just for background because I
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
know the terms confuse a lot of people
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
so Medicaid
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
is children and pregnant women and some
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
disability folks with disabilities
 
05:26:42.650 --> 05:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
versus Medicare is for people over 65.
 
05:26:45.410 --> 05:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
so if I understand this correctly what
 
05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
would happen is folks who are already
 
05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
certified in Medicaid the children
 
05:26:53.330 --> 05:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
that information would be communicated
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
from health and services Human Services
 
05:26:57.590 --> 05:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
to Doe
 
05:27:01.128 --> 05:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the need to do free and
 
05:27:02.750 --> 05:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
reduced price application is that
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
correct I I I believe that's correct but
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great technical
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
question to uh to the folks who are
 
05:27:11.690 --> 05:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
going to come up I'll revisit it thank
 
05:27:11.700 --> 05:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
going to come up I'll revisit it thank
you

05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:27:14.990 --> 05:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
05:27:16.570 --> 05:27:16.580 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock
 
05:27:19.310 --> 05:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for bringing this topic
 
05:27:20.930 --> 05:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
forward for representative and the
 
05:27:23.690 --> 05:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
others and I say it's clearly extremely
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh bill I should I should I
 
05:27:29.570 --> 05:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
should note that this language was
 
05:27:31.550 --> 05:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
originally put forth by representative
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
umberger okay good one okay
 
05:27:39.050 --> 05:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
um that being said the uh question I
 
05:27:43.850 --> 05:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
have is this would this bill negate the
 
05:27:47.470 --> 05:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
current process that she was from uh
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
students that's currently do paper and
 
05:27:54.650 --> 05:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
and applications or they just supplement
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
it I believe it would it would negate
 
05:27:59.570 --> 05:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
that that process so that you would not
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
have principles chasing down
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:10.368 --> 05:28:10.378 align:start position:0%
so they're met go ahead okay so you saw
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
the your thinking is on the by doing it
 
05:28:14.570 --> 05:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
this way it's going to be expanding the
 
05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
the eligibility not the eligibility pool
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
but expanding the pool let those folks
 
05:28:20.770 --> 05:28:20.780 align:start position:0%
know they're eligible and participate
 
05:28:23.570 --> 05:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
correct you'll you'll you'll be much
 
05:28:26.330 --> 05:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
much closer to the the full eligibility
 
05:28:28.368 --> 05:28:28.378 align:start position:0%
number than the paperwork current
 
05:28:30.410 --> 05:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
paperwork approach is getting us thank
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr thank you yes
 
05:28:34.550 --> 05:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative Parnell
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
and this might be a technical question
 
05:28:39.050 --> 05:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
too but does every kid who gets free
 
05:28:42.410 --> 05:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
reduce lunch are they always on Medicaid
 
05:28:42.420 --> 05:28:43.550 align:start position:0%
reduce lunch are they always on Medicaid
already

05:28:43.550 --> 05:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:28:46.550 --> 05:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that no I
 
05:28:49.250 --> 05:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
no and I think that's I you know I think
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good technical question I think
 
05:28:52.970 --> 05:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
that it's also important to note that
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't a okay we've hit the switch
 
05:28:58.730 --> 05:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
and we go from paperwork to to this this
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
is a pilot program there's a lot of data
 
05:29:03.770 --> 05:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
that needs to be shared analysis that
 
05:29:06.650 --> 05:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and um and and then
 
05:29:09.948 --> 05:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
implementation of it so this isn't a um
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
you know hit the switch let's start it
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
right now type of thing but um uh but I
 
05:29:16.730 --> 05:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
think all of that will uh we'll be able
 
05:29:17.690 --> 05:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
to come out
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
in the technical any further questions
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um thank you
 
05:29:22.440 --> 05:29:23.868 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um thank you
um

05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:26.270 --> 05:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in terms of the current
 
05:29:28.430 --> 05:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
application process
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
um there's a whole host of reasons why
 
05:29:33.410 --> 05:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
family might not return
 
05:29:36.170 --> 05:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
um an application one of them was
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to be private and
 
05:29:40.490 --> 05:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it
 
05:29:43.850 --> 05:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
what about those families what about
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
those parents who might not want to
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
participate in this program but now are
 
05:29:51.230 --> 05:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
automatically enrolled in the program
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
without any chance to decline
 
05:29:58.010 --> 05:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
participation yeah thanks so so the this
 
05:30:00.770 --> 05:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
isn't really defining this is defining
 
05:30:02.810 --> 05:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
going into the pilot program I think
 
05:30:04.970 --> 05:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's an important point that that if a
 
05:30:07.250 --> 05:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
family or a student well a family wanted
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
to opt out they certainly could I don't
 
05:30:10.970 --> 05:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
think you can force any student to
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily eat a meal that's put in
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
front of them you know by the school
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
district they could always bring a bag
 
05:30:18.890 --> 05:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
lunch they could you know seniors in
 
05:30:21.530 --> 05:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
some districts have open campus so I I
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it prevents them from from
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh from seeking other options but it
 
05:30:29.208 --> 05:30:29.218 align:start position:0%
just simplifies the process
 
05:30:31.010 --> 05:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
um but still
 
05:30:35.090 --> 05:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
um that family's information
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
is being transferred without their
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge and without their consent
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
um so the the opt-out might apply to a
 
05:30:47.090 --> 05:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
kid eating lunch but it doesn't
 
05:30:50.090 --> 05:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
um apply to an opt-out for their
 
05:30:52.730 --> 05:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
05:30:55.368 --> 05:30:55.378 align:start position:0%
um I I hear what you're saying I I I I
 
05:30:57.948 --> 05:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
think it would be you know if the state
 
05:31:00.288 --> 05:31:00.298 align:start position:0%
decides to move forward with a pilot and
 
05:31:01.850 --> 05:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
then move forward with an implementation
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
that it could consider what other states
 
05:31:05.448 --> 05:31:05.458 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know in this vein a lot of other
 
05:31:08.520 --> 05:31:09.490 align:start position:0%
um you know in this vein a lot of other
states

05:31:09.490 --> 05:31:09.500 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.410 --> 05:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
Pro probably people who have been
 
05:31:18.830 --> 05:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
principals in in in States outside of
 
05:31:20.208 --> 05:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:31:22.010 --> 05:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
um might might be able to talk about how
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
it might be done differently in in other
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
states using a similar process to this
 
05:31:28.970 --> 05:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
maybe not with Medicaid data but with
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
other data uh uh but uh but I I
 
05:31:34.368 --> 05:31:34.378 align:start position:0%
absolutely hear what you're saying
 
05:31:36.650 --> 05:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and I'm I'm sure
 
05:31:40.550 --> 05:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
that um that that a um you know that uh
 
05:31:43.490 --> 05:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh uh policy could be put in place that
 
05:31:45.650 --> 05:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
protects the privacy of these students
 
05:31:48.110 --> 05:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
and Families
 
05:31:50.448 --> 05:31:50.458 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
05:31:52.368 --> 05:31:52.378 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid isn't
 
05:31:55.490 --> 05:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh it's an opt-in program in itself
 
05:31:56.690 --> 05:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
05:31:59.410 --> 05:31:59.420 align:start position:0%
uh it it
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not a Medicaid expert but I
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
I I think you have to yes you're right
 
05:32:05.878 --> 05:32:07.070 align:start position:0%
I I think you have to yes you're right
right

05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:32:07.080 --> 05:32:08.410 align:start position:0%
right
um

05:32:08.410 --> 05:32:08.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:11.810 --> 05:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
we do have HHS here yeah which can help
 
05:32:15.770 --> 05:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
us on that one yes yes represent Belcher
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
is there any concern here that
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
um adopting yet another Federal program
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
puts the state in a position where we're
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
crafting more of our rules around
 
05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
Federal programs that could be changed
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
at any time by the federal government
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
so so thanks for asking the question
 
05:32:38.810 --> 05:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
Medicaid's not a federal program it's a
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
state uh run program with a federal
 
05:32:44.570 --> 05:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
match to it and but the state defines
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
the terms of Medicaid we'll be seeing
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
some more of that and I think Medicaid
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
specific legislation coming over from
 
05:32:54.350 --> 05:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh but uh but this is this is
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
like I said simply to make it easier on
 
05:32:58.850 --> 05:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
students and families I think there may
 
05:33:02.330 --> 05:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
be some some uh conditions such as what
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has pointed out
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that that would need to be
 
05:33:09.288 --> 05:33:09.298 align:start position:0%
addressed as a as a program gets uh gets
 
05:33:10.788 --> 05:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
defined but I think we're at the
 
05:33:13.368 --> 05:33:13.378 align:start position:0%
earliest of the early stages of just
 
05:33:14.810 --> 05:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what what the
 
05:33:16.010 --> 05:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
program could look the other concern is
 
05:33:18.010 --> 05:33:18.020 align:start position:0%
we may be leaving money on the table
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh with uh we have a lot of federal
 
05:33:23.690 --> 05:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
programs for example Carl Perkins is one
 
05:33:25.550 --> 05:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
which the Carl Perkins Grant is also
 
05:33:28.128 --> 05:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
based on poverty that's part of the in
 
05:33:29.570 --> 05:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
that equation
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
so if we do leave money on the table
 
05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're losing out in that thorough
 
05:33:35.570 --> 05:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
dollars and it means that we end up as a
 
05:33:37.970 --> 05:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
state having to cough it up
 
05:33:39.530 --> 05:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
and you know here we are we're going to
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
have our local taxpayer pay it great uh
 
05:33:44.510 --> 05:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
so it's something that we need to look
 
05:33:46.368 --> 05:33:46.378 align:start position:0%
into here and we need more information
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
on it I think that's right that's
 
05:33:50.090 --> 05:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is yes reps and
 
05:33:50.100 --> 05:33:51.890 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is yes reps and
Records

05:33:51.890 --> 05:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
Records
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for looking into
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
this I did last year read the
 
05:34:00.890 --> 05:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
application form and it didn't give us
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
an option of applying and checking it
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
out it basically said if we apply we are
 
05:34:09.890 --> 05:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
promising to follow through all of it
 
05:34:12.110 --> 05:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
and to become part of the program if
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're accepted etc etc I wasn't sure if
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
you were aware of that but given that
 
05:34:20.890 --> 05:34:20.900 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if this is a big if
 
05:34:28.490 --> 05:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is Statewide and is state
 
05:34:32.510 --> 05:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
um overseen why we need to do why we are
 
05:34:35.448 --> 05:34:35.458 align:start position:0%
pursuing this Federal program that has
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
us turn in all kinds of different
 
05:34:40.250 --> 05:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
information and make commitments to
 
05:34:42.170 --> 05:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
follow through and all of that why are
 
05:34:43.730 --> 05:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
we not just looking at our State
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid numbers ourselves I thank you
 
05:34:48.530 --> 05:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
very much for the question and I think
 
05:34:49.850 --> 05:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
that would be a good technical question
 
05:34:51.708 --> 05:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
for the for the people coming up folks
 
05:34:56.410 --> 05:34:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:59.628 --> 05:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
we had we were talking about 50 000 at
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
one point in time I think we're up 90
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
something right now 94 000 or so that's
 
05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
what I heard from Bia the other day and
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know where they're getting their
 
05:35:09.530 --> 05:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
information but uh something for us to
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions we we do have other
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
people on this one right here
 
05:35:21.368 --> 05:35:21.378 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:35:25.610 --> 05:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
hey Robert Berry from HHS hey Robert do
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
you want to speak now or do you are you
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
wanting to either way it's probably
 
05:35:32.208 --> 05:35:32.218 align:start position:0%
better if I defer I'm not here to talk
 
05:35:34.010 --> 05:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
about the nuances I'm here more to talk
 
05:35:35.208 --> 05:35:35.218 align:start position:0%
about the relationship between the
 
05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services okay
 
05:35:39.470 --> 05:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's I'm very narrow in scope so good
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
what what we'll do is I'll hold you
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
often okay thank you uh the next person
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.470 --> 05:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd and members of the
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for uh
 
05:36:19.490 --> 05:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
allowing me to talk today I just I'll
 
05:36:20.690 --> 05:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points because I'm
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
giving you a bunch of paper
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I um
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
so Medicaid direct certification is as a
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative I'll try to be brief
 
05:36:33.170 --> 05:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
because he covered a lot of my points so
 
05:36:36.410 --> 05:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'll just um I'll just say that um
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director reduces child hunger
 
05:36:40.550 --> 05:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
and reduces the administrative burden on
 
05:36:40.560 --> 05:36:41.948 align:start position:0%
and reduces the administrative burden on
schools

05:36:41.948 --> 05:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:36:44.570 --> 05:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hunger Solutions we
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
feel that improves uh and and many other
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
folks believe that it improves student
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
access to healthy meals and reduces food
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
insecurity with important positive
 
05:36:55.970 --> 05:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
outcomes for Children's Health learning
 
05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
and behavior
 
05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
um it increases efficiency by reducing
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
administrative burden
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
reduces School Meal enrollment errors
 
05:37:07.368 --> 05:37:07.378 align:start position:0%
and we're accurately measures children
 
05:37:10.510 --> 05:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
living in poverty I just wanted to note
 
05:37:14.030 --> 05:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
that USDA has been running the pilot
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
since 2012 and 39 other states have
 
05:37:17.760 --> 05:37:18.948 align:start position:0%
since 2012 and 39 other states have
participated

05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
participated
 
05:37:23.230 --> 05:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
so this is not you know a new uh idea
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
and Most states who participate found
 
05:37:28.430 --> 05:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
that it lowered administrative costs to
 
05:37:28.440 --> 05:37:29.708 align:start position:0%
that it lowered administrative costs to
schools

05:37:29.708 --> 05:37:29.718 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:37:33.788 --> 05:37:33.798 align:start position:0%
increased accuracy of of the data
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
and of course increased student access
 
05:37:39.660 --> 05:37:40.330 align:start position:0%
and of course increased student access
um

05:37:40.330 --> 05:37:40.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:43.490 --> 05:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
the the Departments will will tell you
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
that that they've been doing direct
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
certification for other programs for the
 
05:37:52.010 --> 05:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
last 16 years for SNAP for TANF
 
05:37:55.610 --> 05:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh and a number of other programs
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and they know how to do it to protect
 
05:37:58.200 --> 05:38:00.288 align:start position:0%
um and they know how to do it to protect
privacy

05:38:00.288 --> 05:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and just to be clear nobody makes
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
children uh eat meals there's uh that if
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
a family sends a meal to their child
 
05:38:12.530 --> 05:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
they do not have to participate even if
 
05:38:16.250 --> 05:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
they're certified it is not a um it is
 
05:38:18.650 --> 05:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
not a reach out and force this child to
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
eat a meal that never happens
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so the the opt-out is to send your
 
05:38:27.050 --> 05:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
child to the meal to school
 
05:38:27.060 --> 05:38:28.070 align:start position:0%
child to the meal to school
um

05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's I just wanted to note that this the
 
05:38:33.770 --> 05:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
staff from schools can tell you with
 
05:38:36.830 --> 05:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
more eloquence than I but um the staff
 
05:38:38.990 --> 05:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
and paperwork that are currently
 
05:38:41.090 --> 05:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
required to manage the free and reduced
 
05:38:43.970 --> 05:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
meal program collecting those forms is
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
not insignificant and this really
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
streams line the streamlines the process
 
05:38:53.690 --> 05:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
in a way that allows School Food Service
 
05:38:57.170 --> 05:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
directors to focus on feeding children
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and and you know creating the best
 
05:39:02.330 --> 05:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
nutritional program that they can
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:39:07.128 --> 05:39:07.138 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just uh close by saying
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
hunger levels in New Hampshire are high
 
05:39:12.170 --> 05:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
right now unless census household pulse
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
survey 177 503 households with children
 
05:39:19.850 --> 05:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
reported having insufficient food and
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's an increase of over 30 000 since
 
05:39:25.970 --> 05:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
this August with a food insecurity rates
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
climbing School meals are even more
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
essential to Children's well-being than
 
05:39:31.850 --> 05:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
ever and I urge you to support this Bill
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:39:35.410 --> 05:39:35.420 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
05:39:38.638 --> 05:39:39.890 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
I'm

05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this whole program
 
05:39:43.730 --> 05:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
and how it all fits together with the
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
other programs
 
05:39:45.840 --> 05:39:46.490 align:start position:0%
other programs
um

05:39:46.490 --> 05:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:50.150 --> 05:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
and as you mentioned we already direct
 
05:39:52.490 --> 05:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
certify with TANF and you know some of
 
05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
the others and my question is if we do
 
05:39:55.200 --> 05:39:57.410 align:start position:0%
the others and my question is if we do
this

05:39:57.410 --> 05:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid direct certification with
 
05:40:02.930 --> 05:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
the federal government who also supplies
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
the money or some of the money for the
 
05:40:09.890 --> 05:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
 
05:40:09.900 --> 05:40:11.868 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
and

05:40:11.868 --> 05:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:15.410 --> 05:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
if we do that can we still
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
do other methods like if we turn in you
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
know X number of students and that's
 
05:40:24.770 --> 05:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
greater than the number that we get from
 
05:40:26.750 --> 05:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because maybe they're not on
 
05:40:28.850 --> 05:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but they're they are in one of
 
05:40:31.128 --> 05:40:31.138 align:start position:0%
these other programs can we still do
 
05:40:34.490 --> 05:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
that or will they only then take
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
the people in this direct and we can no
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:42.890 --> 05:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:40:44.810 --> 05:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative I I just want to be sure
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
I understand so is the question that
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
05:40:50.930 --> 05:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
um if we do Medicaid direct
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
certification could other children be
 
05:40:55.310 --> 05:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
included for free and reduced meals is
 
05:40:57.530 --> 05:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
that right like we do now with TANF if
 
05:41:00.650 --> 05:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who is or one of those
 
05:41:05.208 --> 05:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
other programs uses that but doesn't
 
05:41:07.730 --> 05:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh hasn't applied for and doesn't take
 
05:41:07.740 --> 05:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh hasn't applied for and doesn't take
Medicaid

05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
05:41:12.970 --> 05:41:12.980 align:start position:0%
will of the federal government still
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
honor that money for the TANF student or
 
05:41:16.798 --> 05:41:17.530 align:start position:0%
honor that money for the TANF student or
whatever

05:41:17.530 --> 05:41:17.540 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:41:20.330 --> 05:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
if we're doing the Medicaid direct or
 
05:41:22.490 --> 05:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
will they only pay us for the Medicaid
 
05:41:22.500 --> 05:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
will they only pay us for the Medicaid
Direct

05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
Direct
 
05:41:27.490 --> 05:41:27.500 align:start position:0%
students no Medicaid uh sorry
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
so Medicaid direct certification is just
 
05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
the process of sharing the data across
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the agencies the free and reduced meal
 
05:41:39.288 --> 05:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
program has its own eligibility which
 
05:41:42.550 --> 05:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't which this doesn't change
 
05:41:46.730 --> 05:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
children are at free at 130 percent of
 
05:41:50.270 --> 05:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
poverty and um and reduced at 185
 
05:41:53.390 --> 05:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
percent of poverty and children who are
 
05:41:55.610 --> 05:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
not on the Medicaid Program who meet
 
05:41:57.890 --> 05:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
those qualifications could apply for
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meals and federal
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
dollars pay a hundred percent of the
 
05:42:04.030 --> 05:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
meal part
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
they would still do that yes sure
 
05:42:09.770 --> 05:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative very similar on the
 
05:42:16.010 --> 05:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
coattails of Representative of Lucas
 
05:42:19.128 --> 05:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
um snap antenna TANF we usually just
 
05:42:20.990 --> 05:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
whoever does the director in the
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
district gets only a case number from
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
the family
 
05:42:30.110 --> 05:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
so would that Medicaid would be a third
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
program as an option for
 
05:42:35.208 --> 05:42:35.218 align:start position:0%
bring reduced so that maybe a case
 
05:42:37.128 --> 05:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
number would just be added
 
05:42:37.138 --> 05:42:38.628 align:start position:0%
number would just be added
or

05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:42:41.570 --> 05:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid recipients do they also
 
05:42:43.490 --> 05:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
receive snap and TANF so that it would
 
05:42:45.890 --> 05:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
just be the Medicaid number that the
 
05:42:48.530 --> 05:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
school would get to certify
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for trying to see if
 
05:42:51.890 --> 05:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's a difference because I think no
 
05:42:53.448 --> 05:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
matter what I suspect we're going to
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
need online applications or paper
 
05:42:58.250 --> 05:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
applications so you don't miss kids who
 
05:43:01.250 --> 05:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
don't qualify for these social programs
 
05:43:03.410 --> 05:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
oh well thank you for the question and
 
05:43:06.050 --> 05:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of what exactly the data
 
05:43:08.330 --> 05:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
matching looks like I can't actually
 
05:43:10.490 --> 05:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
answer that question but I bet some of
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
my uh fellow
 
05:43:15.830 --> 05:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
testifiers in the room can
 
05:43:15.840 --> 05:43:16.670 align:start position:0%
testifiers in the room can
um

05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:19.970 --> 05:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
I will say that um the programs that are
 
05:43:22.750 --> 05:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
directly certified include
 
05:43:26.690 --> 05:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
snap TANF uh kids were homeless kids
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
were in foster care system
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:43:34.788 --> 05:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
um a head start and I'm and I'm sure
 
05:43:36.288 --> 05:43:36.298 align:start position:0%
I'll be corrected by someone else if
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
I've missed something but but I think
 
05:43:41.570 --> 05:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
that adding Medicaid would be a similar
 
05:43:41.580 --> 05:43:43.550 align:start position:0%
that adding Medicaid would be a similar
process

05:43:43.550 --> 05:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:43:43.560 --> 05:43:44.448 align:start position:0%
process
um

05:43:44.448 --> 05:43:44.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from Nick Betty
 
05:43:49.368 --> 05:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
now see thank you very much thank you
 
05:43:52.128 --> 05:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:52.138 --> 05:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:58.970 --> 05:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.980 --> 05:44:04.810 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:44:04.810 --> 05:44:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:06.850 --> 05:44:06.860 align:start position:0%
hi hi
 
05:44:09.470 --> 05:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
welcome welcome I'm just so honored to

be in front of all of you I am I took
 
05:44:12.770 --> 05:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
the liberty of reading all your
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
biographies online before I came here
 
05:44:14.638 --> 05:44:16.190 align:start position:0%
biographies online before I came here
today

05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:44:18.530 --> 05:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I am absolutely Blown Away by oof
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
congratulations as being the youngest
 
05:44:21.770 --> 05:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
rep and the second youngest in the
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
country thank you congratulations on
 
05:44:26.690 --> 05:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
your yellow lab there's so many things I
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
I read all the great things about you if
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
you want to know like what I found
 
05:44:31.128 --> 05:44:31.138 align:start position:0%
particularly appealing and I believe
 
05:44:33.470 --> 05:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
Keane stayed over here correct I also
 
05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
made that bad mistake of going there as
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
well for my undergrad but there's
 
05:44:39.530 --> 05:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
there's so many great opportunities but
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
what I'm here to do is is obviously I am
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I was a teacher at Milford High for
 
05:44:49.430 --> 05:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
25 years and I know um many of you had
 
05:44:50.930 --> 05:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
already talked about different stories
 
05:44:53.030 --> 05:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and I again as with all your
 
05:44:55.070 --> 05:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
biographies you've all had an attachment
 
05:44:57.470 --> 05:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
to education in your case from Alaska to
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
Maine and I know you've gone so you've
 
05:45:00.650 --> 05:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
seen it all
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
um but my point is as a teacher my room
 
05:45:04.910 --> 05:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
was actually right outside the cafeteria
 
05:45:06.410 --> 05:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
when you opened up my door you stepped
 
05:45:08.270 --> 05:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
into the cafeteria at Milford High
 
05:45:10.490 --> 05:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
School so my students never had a reason
 
05:45:13.070 --> 05:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
to be late from lunch or even they were
 
05:45:14.330 --> 05:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
always the first ones in line at lunch
 
05:45:16.128 --> 05:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
which is even better
 
05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
um but in that capacity I also was able
 
05:45:19.490 --> 05:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:45:20.868 --> 05:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
um the milks that were left out in the
 
05:45:22.250 --> 05:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
cafeteria or the orange juice as left
 
05:45:23.810 --> 05:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
out I was the one that could gather them
 
05:45:25.010 --> 05:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
all up and bring them in to put them
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
into my classroom refrigerator and
 
05:45:28.970 --> 05:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
because I had C block off which was our
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
Lunch Period
 
05:45:31.730 --> 05:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
um you know my door was always open
 
05:45:34.128 --> 05:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
because quite often kids need sometimes
 
05:45:35.448 --> 05:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
another place to go other than the
 
05:45:36.890 --> 05:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
cafeteria so my room was very
 
05:45:38.810 --> 05:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
accommodating we always had music we
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
always had but I but more importantly I
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
always had snacks and um that was an
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
incredibly important I could go down a
 
05:45:48.890 --> 05:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
Litany of students Litany of students
 
05:45:50.810 --> 05:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
and many of you probably could too about
 
05:45:53.868 --> 05:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
how important food was for their
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
educational process so well-fed kid you
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
know mileage the the mileage you get
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I'll ask actually use myself as my
 
05:46:03.890 --> 05:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
example though
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
um when I was in seventh grade my dad
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that it was going to be a good
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
idea to separate my brother and I and
 
05:46:12.170 --> 05:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
give us each a separate room split our
 
05:46:14.270 --> 05:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
room in half and I got one half he got
 
05:46:15.410 --> 05:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
the other
 
05:46:17.448 --> 05:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately my brother got the half
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
with the heat induct in it I did not
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
um which was supposed to get fixed for
 
05:46:25.490 --> 05:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
the next 12 years but never did I could
 
05:46:27.830 --> 05:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually scrape ice off the window in my
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
room my girlfriend in 10th Grade gave me
 
05:46:31.910 --> 05:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
a space blanket that was supposed to
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
warm me up like the astronauts I don't
 
05:46:37.070 --> 05:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
know if that worked or not but um
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
when I I went to Bishop Garden High
 
05:46:39.480 --> 05:46:40.128 align:start position:0%
when I I went to Bishop Garden High
School

05:46:40.128 --> 05:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:46:42.530 --> 05:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
um basically on scholarship
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and I was amazed that my life was a
 
05:46:46.548 --> 05:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
lot different than others I went to my
 
05:46:48.830 --> 05:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
friend's house Harold's whose father was
 
05:46:50.448 --> 05:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
a dentist when I walked in his front
 
05:46:50.458 --> 05:46:51.770 align:start position:0%
a dentist when I walked in his front
door

05:46:51.770 --> 05:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
door
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
um he had a water fountain in the middle
 
05:46:57.948 --> 05:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
of of their their entrance the only
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
thing that was wet in my house was the
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
smell of wet dog on our carpet and on
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
our couches so I knew things were
 
05:47:04.920 --> 05:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
our couches so I knew things were
different

05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:47:08.090 --> 05:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
um and I knew you know something was up
 
05:47:10.490 --> 05:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
my mother had grad had gone to eighth
 
05:47:11.570 --> 05:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
grade dropped out and became a
 
05:47:13.730 --> 05:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
hairdresser my dad was kind of a
 
05:47:15.708 --> 05:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
deadbeat so we were kind of on our own
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
and um I didn't have the same luxuries
 
05:47:21.230 --> 05:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
as they did and I was an average kid but
 
05:47:22.730 --> 05:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
I always was going to school hungry uh
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
BG didn't have a free you know free
 
05:47:26.208 --> 05:47:26.218 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch it was a private school so
 
05:47:27.948 --> 05:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
we didn't get any of that so it was
 
05:47:29.150 --> 05:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
really interesting how you could go
 
05:47:31.368 --> 05:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
through school and learn how to starve
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
um but what a shock when I went to Keene
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
State and they actually had a dining
 
05:47:38.510 --> 05:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
Commons and that I gave my Freshman 15
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
in two weeks I was it was amazing but
 
05:47:43.368 --> 05:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
more importantly I'm just a story I want
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
to say is that I was going to get milk
 
05:47:47.930 --> 05:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
one of the days and at Keene State you
 
05:47:50.690 --> 05:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
had chocolate milk you know whole milk
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
and two percent milk so I filled up my
 
05:47:55.730 --> 05:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
chocolate milk with um half a glass and
 
05:47:57.410 --> 05:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
I went over to the whole milk and I
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
started to pour whole milk in it and one
 
05:48:00.410 --> 05:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
of my friends was like what are you
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
doing and I said well you know you have
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
to you have to cut the chocolate milk
 
05:48:05.690 --> 05:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
because it's too rich it's too thick you
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
can't drink it on its own and he's
 
05:48:09.470 --> 05:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
looking at me and he's like are you nuts
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm like well no that's what my
 
05:48:12.830 --> 05:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
mother always did you know I mean that's
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
what we did and he sat there and he said
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know you should try it just by
 
05:48:19.490 --> 05:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
itself and see how that works out you
 
05:48:21.230 --> 05:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
know and my wife also went to Revere
 
05:48:22.610 --> 05:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
college and she had the same system
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
there too
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
um and I just I was blown away that you
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
know my mother kept that a secret and
 
05:48:31.490 --> 05:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it was and so living
 
05:48:33.250 --> 05:48:33.260 align:start position:0%
through that type of poverty and and
 
05:48:35.690 --> 05:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
just to backtrack a little bit when I
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
was a girl and there was a brother child
 
05:48:39.170 --> 05:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
else that I had who who figured it out
 
05:48:40.730 --> 05:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
like whether because I wore the same
 
05:48:41.930 --> 05:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
clothes all the time or the same time
 
05:48:43.850 --> 05:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
all the time he kind of figured it out
 
05:48:45.410 --> 05:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
that I needed something and I needed you
 
05:48:46.970 --> 05:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
know so he always had a little cabinet
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
and many of you teach us know this we
 
05:48:49.850 --> 05:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
always have our own little cabinet mine
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
was a lower bottom right drawer where we
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
had snack Central
 
05:48:54.770 --> 05:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
um and everybody who says teachers pay
 
05:48:56.448 --> 05:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
you know but we also pay most of our
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
money not for school supplies but for
 
05:48:59.570 --> 05:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
snacks as well
 
05:49:01.070 --> 05:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
um you know he always hooked me up with
 
05:49:02.750 --> 05:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
a snack and it was very very important
 
05:49:04.670 --> 05:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
because I would actually he even gave me
 
05:49:07.010 --> 05:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
the he said look just come here in the
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
morning Nobody's around grab a snack I
 
05:49:11.208 --> 05:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
used to drink Welch's grape juice which
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
I never even you know I didn't like
 
05:49:14.750 --> 05:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
grape juice but I drank it because that
 
05:49:16.128 --> 05:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
was there
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and he also had crackers and stuff
 
05:49:20.090 --> 05:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
stuff too and Little Debbie snacks
 
05:49:22.250 --> 05:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
when I became a teacher I realized how
 
05:49:23.810 --> 05:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
important that was and I carried on that
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
same tradition and again like my room
 
05:49:27.170 --> 05:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
was right next to the calf and you could
 
05:49:29.330 --> 05:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
always make sure
 
05:49:31.850 --> 05:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
um that kids could have a snack and the
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
same thing my room was open every
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
morning for lunch and so on like that
 
05:49:37.490 --> 05:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
I really believe that we're one bite
 
05:49:39.650 --> 05:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
away quite often or one meal away from
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
turning a kid I was an average kid I
 
05:49:43.490 --> 05:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
could have gone either way it would have
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
been really really easy for me to take a
 
05:49:48.048 --> 05:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
bad Road you know and to have somebody
 
05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
invest in me change the entire Outlook
 
05:49:53.628 --> 05:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
of my life I I just retired from Milford
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
High School in my 25-year tenure I was
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized twice as teacher
 
05:50:00.530 --> 05:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
of the year I was four time New
 
05:50:03.530 --> 05:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teacher of the year I was a
 
05:50:05.868 --> 05:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
James Madison fellow recipient in 2000 I
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
was the president of the New Hampshire
 
05:50:09.010 --> 05:50:09.020 align:start position:0%
Council for social studies
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
I believe that none of that would have
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
happened if I didn't have the right
 
05:50:16.128 --> 05:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
direction do you know what I mean and I
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
think you know lots of times we sit
 
05:50:19.610 --> 05:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
there as Educators and say where are the
 
05:50:21.650 --> 05:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
you know we're the Thomas Jefferson's
 
05:50:23.390 --> 05:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
where the George Washington's where the
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
James Madison's and they're in the
 
05:50:28.730 --> 05:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
classroom you just got to kind of give
 
05:50:30.170 --> 05:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
them a chance you know what I mean and
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't cultivate that they could
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
be anybody they could be that kid that's
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
starving you know and you give them a
 
05:50:37.128 --> 05:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
little a bit of nutrition like well
 
05:50:38.510 --> 05:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
you're a constitutionalist like
 
05:50:40.730 --> 05:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
Jefferson says the tree of Liberty needs
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
to be watered right you water a child
 
05:50:45.048 --> 05:50:45.058 align:start position:0%
once in a while and there you go you
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
know and the next thing you know you
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
have a producing adult
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
um sadly just as an end note I went to
 
05:50:53.810 --> 05:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
go thank brother Charles um he was uh
 
05:50:55.548 --> 05:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
kind of put to pasture when they retire
 
05:50:58.368 --> 05:50:58.378 align:start position:0%
down in Rhode Island for BG and I took
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
my 12 year old daughter down to the era
 
05:51:02.150 --> 05:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
when I won my first national teacher of
 
05:51:05.090 --> 05:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
the year just to let him know oh my God
 
05:51:05.100 --> 05:51:08.090 align:start position:0%
the year just to let him know oh my God
and

05:51:08.090 --> 05:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:10.368 --> 05:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
you know and I went down there
 
05:51:12.770 --> 05:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
um he was suffering from Alzheimer's so
 
05:51:15.770 --> 05:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
he never got the chance to know just how
 
05:51:18.170 --> 05:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
important he was to me
 
05:51:20.330 --> 05:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
so don't take that away from anybody
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
else and I'm all better now I can
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
compose myself I'm good but uh so that's
 
05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick story like we all have
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
stories but I just thought that
 
05:51:31.490 --> 05:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know my story was was just
 
05:51:33.708 --> 05:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
as important as the number in 25 years
 
05:51:35.208 --> 05:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
of kids that came in and out of my door
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%

the committee nice to see you again my
 
05:53:10.610 --> 05:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
name is Sean Parr I'm on the Manchester
 
05:53:12.350 --> 05:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
School Board where I sit on the policy
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee and then and chair the
 
05:53:15.890 --> 05:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
education legislation committee today
 
05:53:17.570 --> 05:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on behalf of the Manchester
 
05:53:19.788 --> 05:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
School Board which has authorized me to
 
05:53:22.490 --> 05:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
Advocate that Medicaid be used as a
 
05:53:24.288 --> 05:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
primary calculator for free and reduced
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
meals numbers for New Hampshire school
 
05:53:28.610 --> 05:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
districts we are unanimous in our
 
05:53:30.110 --> 05:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
support of New Hampshire's application
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid direct certification
 
05:53:35.628 --> 05:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
program as proposed in hb601 the current
 
05:53:37.970 --> 05:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
process for School Meal applications is
 
05:53:40.490 --> 05:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and undercounts the number of
 
05:53:42.350 --> 05:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
students actually eligible for free and
 
05:53:44.448 --> 05:53:44.458 align:start position:0%
reduced School meals Medicaid direct
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
certification would reduce
 
05:53:47.510 --> 05:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
administrative costs related to these
 
05:53:49.490 --> 05:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
applications while also increasing
 
05:53:52.010 --> 05:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
funding vital to feeding our students
 
05:53:54.170 --> 05:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
this is a nonpartisan issue that
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
benefits all our students in fact many
 
05:53:58.570 --> 05:53:58.580 align:start position:0%
states as you heard already participate
 
05:54:01.788 --> 05:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
from California New York Pennsylvania to
 
05:54:04.030 --> 05:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
Kentucky West Virginia and Alabama
 
05:54:06.590 --> 05:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
evidence from States who participate in
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrate its Effectiveness it
 
05:54:12.170 --> 05:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
improves low-income students access to
 
05:54:14.570 --> 05:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
nutritious meals while decreasing State
 
05:54:16.970 --> 05:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
administrative costs like these states
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would benefit greatly from
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
adopting Medicaid direct certification
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
and we ask that you support this Bill
 
05:54:25.310 --> 05:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration thank
 
05:54:27.410 --> 05:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
05:54:27.420 --> 05:54:29.810 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
committee

05:54:29.810 --> 05:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:54:32.330 --> 05:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
um is it Alex Grappone yeah
 
05:54:40.320 --> 05:54:41.750 align:start position:0%
um is it Alex Grappone yeah
yeah okay

05:54:41.750 --> 05:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
05:54:49.368 --> 05:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for having me
 
05:54:53.208 --> 05:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
um as I already said I'm Alexander
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
Grappone from Concord High School I'm
 
05:54:57.530 --> 05:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
currently a senior and I'm the president
 
05:54:59.628 --> 05:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
of our high school save the children
 
05:55:01.850 --> 05:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
club which deals with tackling the issue
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
of childhood hunger
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
um when you go to school you want to be
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
successful right because the whole goal
 
05:55:10.610 --> 05:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
is getting into college and going places
 
05:55:12.890 --> 05:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
and doing things but you can't do that
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you're hungry if you're hungry you
 
05:55:18.288 --> 05:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
lose focus if you're hungry you can get
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
more upset to a small minor glitch in
 
05:55:22.850 --> 05:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
your day and if you're hungry you just
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
you honestly can't Thrive the way you
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
could if you were running at maximum
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
capacity of being able to have access to
 
05:55:33.288 --> 05:55:33.298 align:start position:0%
food there's a population of students
 
05:55:34.910 --> 05:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
that come from foreign countries and
 
05:55:38.208 --> 05:55:38.218 align:start position:0%
their parents don't speak English so how
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
can you expect when you give them a form
 
05:55:42.410 --> 05:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
in English for Medicaid for free and
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch that they would know how
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
to fill it out with not being able to
 
05:55:48.288 --> 05:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
fill out those forms those students go
 
05:55:50.810 --> 05:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
hungry and when they're hungry they
 
05:55:52.910 --> 05:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
can't learn and when you can't learn you
 
05:55:54.170 --> 05:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
can't be the best student that you can
 
05:55:57.770 --> 05:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
be and this starts from day one they go
 
05:55:59.690 --> 05:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
to school a lot of these kids come over
 
05:56:01.970 --> 05:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
here at the age of seven so from the age
 
05:56:03.770 --> 05:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
of seven they're not eating and they're
 
05:56:07.368 --> 05:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
not focusing those tools of being able
 
05:56:09.288 --> 05:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
to focus in school are not developing
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
which can lead to them falling behind
 
05:56:13.970 --> 05:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
academically as they progress in their
 
05:56:15.530 --> 05:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
academic careers
 
05:56:17.690 --> 05:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
I believe if you take away the
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to fill out this paperwork
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
it will drop the language barrier which
 
05:56:24.110 --> 05:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
many families face not being able to
 
05:56:26.690 --> 05:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
speak English even if they could get to
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
Concord High by bus to meet with an ell
 
05:56:31.670 --> 05:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
teacher who's going to say that the El
 
05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
teacher will have time or is even there
 
05:56:36.590 --> 05:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
to help them fill out the paperwork
 
05:56:39.470 --> 05:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's crucial that every student has the
 
05:56:42.590 --> 05:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to eat food to be able to
 
05:56:44.150 --> 05:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
learn in school and Thrive academically
 
05:56:48.530 --> 05:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
food is fuel to your day I imagine going
 
05:56:51.288 --> 05:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
to school every day being hungry imagine
 
05:56:52.970 --> 05:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
doing your job right here right now
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
being hungry you wouldn't be able to
 
05:56:58.010 --> 05:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
focus you wouldn't be able to listen
 
05:57:00.048 --> 05:57:00.058 align:start position:0%
I mean I was in AP lip the other day and
 
05:57:01.250 --> 05:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
I didn't eat enough and I felt like I
 
05:57:04.270 --> 05:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.708 --> 05:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
this past fall my school saved the
 
05:57:08.930 --> 05:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
children club that held a food drive
 
05:57:12.530 --> 05:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
around town in 14 local stores and we
 
05:57:16.490 --> 05:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
raised 300 and collected 157 food items
 
05:57:18.530 --> 05:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
we delivered that to Beaver Meadows
 
05:57:20.570 --> 05:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
Elementary School which is a very high
 
05:57:23.868 --> 05:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
need for food school they run a backpack
 
05:57:25.730 --> 05:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
program they fill up every week and give
 
05:57:28.010 --> 05:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
kids food when we arrived at that food
 
05:57:30.410 --> 05:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
closet it was very alarming to see how
 
05:57:32.090 --> 05:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
low it was and to know that these kids
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
will go home with like barely anything
 
05:57:37.190 --> 05:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
in their backpacks to know that they
 
05:57:39.470 --> 05:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
have to survive on potentially the one
 
05:57:42.110 --> 05:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
meal they get at school per day that's
 
05:57:44.510 --> 05:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's not okay that cannot be happening
 
05:57:47.330 --> 05:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
it it just it's not
 
05:57:49.310 --> 05:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
um so it was really great to be able to
 
05:57:51.650 --> 05:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
give them that boost but I also want to
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:54.600 --> 05:57:57.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:57:57.250 --> 05:57:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
School the options for food at lunch is
 
05:58:04.010 --> 05:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
Burgers pizza and like sometimes a salad
 
05:58:05.690 --> 05:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
if kids can get there in time to get it
 
05:58:07.970 --> 05:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's not nutritional the food in our
 
05:58:09.770 --> 05:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
school needs to have nutritional value
 
05:58:11.810 --> 05:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
so then you can actually feel like
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
you've had nutrition because if you
 
05:58:16.670 --> 05:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
drink for instance like a sugary
 
05:58:18.170 --> 05:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
something you're not going to feel like
 
05:58:20.208 --> 05:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
you actually have energy compared to if
 
05:58:21.708 --> 05:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
you had like a granola bar giving you
 
05:58:23.930 --> 05:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
sustenance to be able to properly run
 
05:58:25.970 --> 05:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
without your day
 
05:58:27.770 --> 05:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I remember in ninth grade my best
 
05:58:29.628 --> 05:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
friend kept asking me for granola bars
 
05:58:31.250 --> 05:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's like why is he doing this and I was
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
like he's hungry and it hit me that he
 
05:58:36.288 --> 05:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
comes from a lower income home and I was
 
05:58:38.810 --> 05:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
like wow he might not have the same
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
access to food that I do and it was just
 
05:58:43.250 --> 05:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
and of course I gave them the girl over
 
05:58:45.890 --> 05:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
every day and anyone else who asked I
 
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
would it's just I honestly believe that
 
05:58:50.270 --> 05:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
food is a human right and everyone
 
05:58:53.448 --> 05:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
should have access to that so I urge you
 
05:58:55.430 --> 05:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
to drop the language barrier of this
 
05:58:57.890 --> 05:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid require government so every kid
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
can have the opportunity to thrive in
 
05:59:02.750 --> 05:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
school and be given an equal playing
 
05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
field by having that taken away the
 
05:59:08.208 --> 05:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
paperwork which is barring these kids
 
05:59:10.730 --> 05:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
from being able to successfully thrive
 
05:59:13.250 --> 05:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
in school thank you thank you very much
 
05:59:14.750 --> 05:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
05:59:14.760 --> 05:59:16.788 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh yes represent
 
05:59:18.840 --> 05:59:20.090 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh yes represent

I just want to know if you'd like me to
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
write a recommendation for your college
 
05:59:23.040 --> 05:59:26.350 align:start position:0%
write a recommendation for your college
application

05:59:26.350 --> 05:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you but pepper you've been
 
05:59:28.558 --> 05:59:30.250 align:start position:0%
thank you but pepper you've been
submitted

05:59:30.250 --> 05:59:30.260 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay at this point in time uh we have
 
05:59:38.090 --> 05:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
now the technical support which we can
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
utilize so Mark and uh Robert uh you're
 
05:59:46.010 --> 05:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
both ones from HHS the others from doe
 
05:59:49.368 --> 05:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
um so once you you know we we do have
 
05:59:51.288 --> 05:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
some questions you know in follow-up to
 
05:59:53.810 --> 05:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
what we did with representative umberger
 
05:59:59.690 --> 05:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh with this program uh last year and so
 
06:00:01.788 --> 06:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
um if you're if you want to sit together
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.280 --> 06:00:06.548 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:00:09.410 --> 06:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
there's this card right here and we've
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
had Mark before
 
06:00:13.128 --> 06:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
I'll try to start why don't you go ahead
 
06:00:15.530 --> 06:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
first Mark and then we're we're just you
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
know jab some of these questions at you
 
06:00:18.410 --> 06:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think there's three questions
 
06:00:21.590 --> 06:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's probably more questions that you
 
06:00:23.868 --> 06:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
kind of defer to technical assistance
 
06:00:25.788 --> 06:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
um I think we got a history and a
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
background but um
 
06:00:30.410 --> 06:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh the way the way the f r program works
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
by the way uh Mark manganol Department
 
06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
of Education for the record the way f r
 
06:00:36.530 --> 06:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
numbers work is you have the direct
 
06:00:39.470 --> 06:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
certification program which is snap TANF
 
06:00:42.770 --> 06:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
also Foster families and migration
 
06:00:45.530 --> 06:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
um uh migrant migrant families um that's
 
06:00:48.110 --> 06:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
a way to direct certify as yourself as
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for the f r program and so what
 
06:00:52.368 --> 06:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
happens is that those are DHHS run
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
programs DHHS has that data DHS owns
 
06:00:57.530 --> 06:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
that data but then there is a sharing of
 
06:01:00.170 --> 06:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
data with the Department of Education
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
and most of the data lives and is owned
 
06:01:05.868 --> 06:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
by DHHS but we give over sasid
 
06:01:07.250 --> 06:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
information we give over information
 
06:01:10.610 --> 06:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
that DHHS can use to match that data and
 
06:01:13.368 --> 06:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
DHHS is able to take their data take our
 
06:01:14.930 --> 06:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
data and say these are the students and
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
bring it back to us and say these are
 
06:01:17.810 --> 06:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
the students that are part of these
 
06:01:20.930 --> 06:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
programs TANF snap you name it so
 
06:01:22.368 --> 06:01:22.378 align:start position:0%
they're able to match the data for us
 
06:01:24.170 --> 06:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
and from there we're able to identify
 
06:01:26.690 --> 06:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
which students are directly certified as
 
06:01:28.730 --> 06:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
eligible to the fnr program program and
 
06:01:30.288 --> 06:01:30.298 align:start position:0%
then we send that to the schools and
 
06:01:31.730 --> 06:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
then the schools will have a direct cert
 
06:01:33.410 --> 06:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
list and they can ensure that those
 
06:01:36.170 --> 06:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
students are not either the way direct
 
06:01:37.850 --> 06:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
cert and Kelly Rambo is in here she even
 
06:01:39.048 --> 06:01:39.058 align:start position:0%
understood as the food and nutrition
 
06:01:41.090 --> 06:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
program I believe every student who
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
directs certifies is labeled as free
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
meaning not free and reduced that means
 
06:01:46.368 --> 06:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
they don't pay anything they don't pay a
 
06:01:47.990 --> 06:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
reduced price they don't they get a they
 
06:01:49.610 --> 06:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
get free meals
 
06:01:49.620 --> 06:01:50.390 align:start position:0%
get free meals
um

06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
so the way that works is now everyone's
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
direct certified on a direct direct
 
06:01:55.850 --> 06:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
certified list
 
06:01:55.860 --> 06:01:56.810 align:start position:0%
certified list
um

06:01:56.810 --> 06:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:58.850 --> 06:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
um so that they can run their nutrition
 
06:02:01.010 --> 06:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
program and know who to charge what and
 
06:02:02.990 --> 06:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
and if the student receives a charge or
 
06:02:04.910 --> 06:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
not the way this program's a lot we've
 
06:02:06.410 --> 06:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
been studying this for for a while now
 
06:02:07.970 --> 06:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot we've answered a lot
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
of questions there's still some
 
06:02:10.788 --> 06:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
questions that we we still have that the
 
06:02:14.030 --> 06:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
department has but we've um to get to
 
06:02:16.490 --> 06:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative leakis's question
 
06:02:19.788 --> 06:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
um why since this is already State
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data why do we need to apply to
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
this program to get access to it and so
 
06:02:28.730 --> 06:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program is regulated by CMS
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
and so CMS will not allow the Department
 
06:02:32.448 --> 06:02:32.458 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to just
 
06:02:34.850 --> 06:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
hand over the data unless they're part
 
06:02:38.150 --> 06:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
of this program so CMS they Grant a DHS
 
06:02:39.530 --> 06:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
can talk more about Medicaid programs
 
06:02:40.730 --> 06:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
but there's waivers and all these
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
processes but CMS will allow state
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
agencies to share this type of data if
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're in this program so the only way
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to get access to this data
 
06:02:51.470 --> 06:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education from DHHS is
 
06:02:53.948 --> 06:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to enter this program
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
authorized by USDA and then CMS will
 
06:03:00.288 --> 06:03:00.298 align:start position:0%
allow DHHS to start share start the data
 
06:03:02.750 --> 06:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
sharing process so that's that's one of
 
06:03:04.490 --> 06:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
the reasons why um
 
06:03:06.288 --> 06:03:06.298 align:start position:0%
you have to go through the USDA program
 
06:03:08.270 --> 06:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
to access this
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I think I've answered a few questions
 
06:03:14.570 --> 06:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
one uh representative cordelli talked
 
06:03:16.610 --> 06:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
about the opt-outs questions we've been
 
06:03:17.930 --> 06:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
discussing that I think for the past
 
06:03:17.940 --> 06:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
discussing that I think for the past
year

06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:03:19.200 --> 06:03:20.510 align:start position:0%
year
um

06:03:20.510 --> 06:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:22.010 --> 06:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
I think last time we talked last time
 
06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
this committee met and talked about this
 
06:03:25.250 --> 06:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
back in the summer
 
06:03:26.930 --> 06:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
there's kind of the ideas they're a
 
06:03:28.250 --> 06:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
state opt-out or is there a local
 
06:03:31.128 --> 06:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
opt-out the local opt-out would be this
 
06:03:33.230 --> 06:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh the School receives that direct cert
 
06:03:35.510 --> 06:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
list and they go the family could opt
 
06:03:37.010 --> 06:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
out at the local level and say take me
 
06:03:38.330 --> 06:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
off the list that would be a local
 
06:03:40.868 --> 06:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
opt-out that seems
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
intuitive that that could be implemented
 
06:03:45.650 --> 06:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
with some technical assistance from the
 
06:03:45.660 --> 06:03:46.970 align:start position:0%
with some technical assistance from the
Department

06:03:46.970 --> 06:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
Department
 
06:03:48.770 --> 06:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
um but that's a local opt-out it would
 
06:03:50.570 --> 06:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
still revolve and still involve some
 
06:03:54.048 --> 06:03:54.058 align:start position:0%
data going from DHHS
 
06:03:55.730 --> 06:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education to school
 
06:03:57.288 --> 06:03:57.298 align:start position:0%
so it'd still be data sharing but there
 
06:03:59.750 --> 06:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be opt out at the local level
 
06:03:59.760 --> 06:04:00.708 align:start position:0%
would be opt out at the local level
um

06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:01.850 --> 06:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
we have to probably work with the
 
06:04:02.810 --> 06:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
to see if there's potential opt out at
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
the at the state application Level so
 
06:04:09.890 --> 06:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
before the family even submits data to
 
06:04:11.448 --> 06:04:11.458 align:start position:0%
the state they have now opt out at the
 
06:04:13.310 --> 06:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
application Level
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and then that would be a policy
 
06:04:15.890 --> 06:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
decision probably something we'd want to
 
06:04:17.448 --> 06:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
talk with the legislature about about if
 
06:04:18.890 --> 06:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
that off type opt out is something the
 
06:04:20.690 --> 06:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
legislature is interested in
 
06:04:22.610 --> 06:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
um this this we'd all have a set policy
 
06:04:23.868 --> 06:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
on this but those are the questions
 
06:04:25.310 --> 06:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing for the past year
 
06:04:28.430 --> 06:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
as far as privacy and opt out what paths
 
06:04:30.250 --> 06:04:30.260 align:start position:0%
what options would the program have
 
06:04:32.270 --> 06:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's some unanswered questions there
 
06:04:33.470 --> 06:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
as far as what can we reasonably
 
06:04:35.090 --> 06:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
Implement I think the local opt-out
 
06:04:36.890 --> 06:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
would be the we know we can Implement
 
06:04:39.288 --> 06:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
that that that sounds pretty um feasible
 
06:04:40.970 --> 06:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can implement the
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
state level opt-out or state application
 
06:04:44.868 --> 06:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
06:04:46.610 --> 06:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh I think that answered a few of the
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions we had I don't know if we
 
06:04:50.990 --> 06:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
um oh the the difference between the
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid out of DHS could talk about it
 
06:04:54.048 --> 06:04:54.058 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid application the fnr
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
application the Medicaid application I I
 
06:04:59.090 --> 06:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
believe is a really uh difficult process
 
06:05:00.770 --> 06:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's um I think it's a lot
 
06:05:02.390 --> 06:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
of I think they might do do they do a
 
06:05:04.850 --> 06:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
five-year look back on so the up on our
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
program I don't believe is doing a
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
five-year look back on your assets
 
06:05:10.010 --> 06:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
um it's just for your income um the
 
06:05:11.810 --> 06:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
Medicaid process is
 
06:05:13.548 --> 06:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
um yes there's more work involved in
 
06:05:14.930 --> 06:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
that process so there are two different
 
06:05:14.940 --> 06:05:17.590 align:start position:0%
that process so there are two different
applications

06:05:17.590 --> 06:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:22.368 --> 06:05:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:23.868 --> 06:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon for the record Robert
 
06:05:25.610 --> 06:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
Berry general counsel to the division of
 
06:05:25.620 --> 06:05:26.930 align:start position:0%
Berry general counsel to the division of
Medicaid

06:05:26.930 --> 06:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
um honestly a lot of people provided
 
06:05:31.128 --> 06:05:31.138 align:start position:0%
everything I was going to say
 
06:05:33.288 --> 06:05:33.298 align:start position:0%
um as um you know the chair indicated
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
earlier um this is going to be going
 
06:05:37.010 --> 06:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
forward to a work session the department
 
06:05:40.490 --> 06:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh was here really to offer its um
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
assistance with that work session I'm
 
06:05:43.730 --> 06:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
working with Department of Education
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
this committee and stakeholders to come
 
06:05:48.530 --> 06:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
up with a a piece of legislation that
 
06:05:50.330 --> 06:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
everybody could be happy with
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
so if if we go ahead with a program like
 
06:05:53.400 --> 06:05:54.470 align:start position:0%
so if if we go ahead with a program like
this

06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
will we end up with more
 
06:05:59.868 --> 06:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
more student students for example at the
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
high school right now we're we see a
 
06:06:03.410 --> 06:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
drop off with students participating in
 
06:06:04.910 --> 06:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
the free and reduce program at the high
 
06:06:07.190 --> 06:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
school and that's nothing new that's
 
06:06:10.368 --> 06:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
been on for a long time uh will we see
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
this increase as a result of getting
 
06:06:15.708 --> 06:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
involved with Medicaid in this and
 
06:06:19.010 --> 06:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's my primary goal here is to ensure
 
06:06:21.170 --> 06:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
that we have those high school students
 
06:06:23.270 --> 06:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
which were not
 
06:06:25.910 --> 06:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh affording that while we're affording
 
06:06:27.470 --> 06:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity a lot of times
 
06:06:29.690 --> 06:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
applications don't come in for the grade
 
06:06:31.250 --> 06:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
school kids saw left on the school bus
 
06:06:32.810 --> 06:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
or it's in the backpack or never even
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
gets into the backpack at school still
 
06:06:36.650 --> 06:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
on their desk or wherever it might be
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
but with the high school kids there's
 
06:06:41.810 --> 06:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
few of them returned and how do we get
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
then some structure in which we can we
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
know we have X number at the high school
 
06:06:51.770 --> 06:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
that are are are not uh receiving this
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
benefit and we're not receiving the
 
06:06:56.690 --> 06:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
benefit as a state for eligibility as as
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
poverty so that then it then it bounces
 
06:07:01.570 --> 06:07:01.580 align:start position:0%
in everything we do our in our financial
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
formulas and the Career Technical
 
06:07:06.650 --> 06:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
education with Carl Perkins all that we
 
06:07:09.708 --> 06:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
our poverty rate will go up that's what
 
06:07:12.288 --> 06:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
my goal is to just get more two things
 
06:07:15.410 --> 06:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
get the kids all eating
 
06:07:18.948 --> 06:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
and then secondly to try to get the
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
federal dollars which we're leaving on
 
06:07:21.948 --> 06:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
the table
 
06:07:24.048 --> 06:07:24.058 align:start position:0%
so can you speak that a little bit uh
 
06:07:27.410 --> 06:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
Mark so I don't have a Medicaid um I did
 
06:07:29.090 --> 06:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
get from director Lipman
 
06:07:31.128 --> 06:07:31.138 align:start position:0%
um from DHHS I did get uh some Medicaid
 
06:07:32.510 --> 06:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
data yeah
 
06:07:32.520 --> 06:07:33.288 align:start position:0%
data yeah
um

06:07:33.288 --> 06:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:35.690 --> 06:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid data is a little on the
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic just like a lot of data sets
 
06:07:38.930 --> 06:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
the pandemic have influenced that data
 
06:07:40.850 --> 06:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
set um currently and I don't know where
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're at currently with that but I know
 
06:07:44.330 --> 06:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
that during the pandemic
 
06:07:46.250 --> 06:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh people were not being disenrolled
 
06:07:48.650 --> 06:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid in order because of the
 
06:07:50.810 --> 06:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
public health emergency they were being
 
06:07:52.250 --> 06:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
stayed on Medicaid even though they
 
06:07:53.890 --> 06:07:53.900 align:start position:0%
would have been routinely up for real
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
re-enrollment or re-eligibility so that
 
06:07:58.788 --> 06:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
I know that's phasing out eventually
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of the data set we have is
 
06:08:02.810 --> 06:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
is inflated in the sense that no one was
 
06:08:04.368 --> 06:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
been kicked off the rolls so we know
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
those data sets are high during the
 
06:08:05.760 --> 06:08:07.010 align:start position:0%
those data sets are high during the
pandemic

06:08:07.010 --> 06:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
06:08:09.170 --> 06:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
um the latest data set I got from DHHS
 
06:08:13.730 --> 06:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh was as of July 1 2019 it said there
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
was 52 000 students ages 5 to 18. on
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and DHHS has narrowed in their
 
06:08:25.250 --> 06:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
ability to get us the income numbers we
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
are looking for for our fnr program when
 
06:08:28.990 --> 06:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
they originally gave it to us it was um
 
06:08:31.250 --> 06:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
196 of the federal property guidelines
 
06:08:33.890 --> 06:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
now it's up to 185 percent now it's
 
06:08:36.770 --> 06:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
exactly at 185. so a better they've uh
 
06:08:38.930 --> 06:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
DHHS has better fine-tuned they're
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
querying into their data and so
 
06:08:45.850 --> 06:08:45.860 align:start position:0%
for July 2019 it's 52 000 kids for July
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
122. it's 56 000 kids uh 5 to 18 on
 
06:08:50.878 --> 06:08:51.830 align:start position:0%
122. it's 56 000 kids uh 5 to 18 on
Medicaid

06:08:51.830 --> 06:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
um uh that's a One Moment In Time
 
06:08:53.280 --> 06:08:54.530 align:start position:0%
um uh that's a One Moment In Time
snapshot

06:08:54.530 --> 06:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
snapshot
 
06:08:56.690 --> 06:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that is more than currently what we
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
have right now we're estimating for this
 
06:09:01.070 --> 06:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
school year is 38 000 kids so are you
 
06:09:03.770 --> 06:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
talking uh free and free and reduced the
 
06:09:06.288 --> 06:09:06.298 align:start position:0%
38 000 38 000 yeah it's a significant
 
06:09:09.410 --> 06:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
increase so yes and so I've done a
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh working with that data
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and running it through the formula
 
06:09:16.310 --> 06:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
and uh so I have two different data sets
 
06:09:18.470 --> 06:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
from DHHS I have one that has in
 
06:09:20.570 --> 06:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
pandemic inflated numbers and I have one
 
06:09:22.730 --> 06:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
number that's data set that's older but
 
06:09:25.250 --> 06:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
not influenced by the pandemic so I came
 
06:09:26.448 --> 06:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
up with a high and low estimate I'm
 
06:09:27.650 --> 06:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
gonna work with Mickey landrigan with
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
the LBA to
 
06:09:31.670 --> 06:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
um uh come with a number this is really
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
hard to estimate but just playing with
 
06:09:35.090 --> 06:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
that data and kind of come up with a
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
ballpark number
 
06:09:39.948 --> 06:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
um if we took that 2019 number and we
 
06:09:41.810 --> 06:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
try to take our current enrollment
 
06:09:44.390 --> 06:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
Decline and apply it to that number
 
06:09:44.400 --> 06:09:45.128 align:start position:0%
Decline and apply it to that number
um

06:09:45.128 --> 06:09:45.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:47.448 --> 06:09:47.458 align:start position:0%
ah and apply the same student
 
06:09:49.310 --> 06:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
demographic enrollment client Trends to
 
06:09:52.730 --> 06:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
it it gets us to around 47 000 students
 
06:09:54.890 --> 06:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
so it's about 9 000 students more than
 
06:09:56.570 --> 06:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
we're currently having so that's about a
 
06:09:58.910 --> 06:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
9 000 student account jump in our f r
 
06:09:58.920 --> 06:09:59.810 align:start position:0%
9 000 student account jump in our f r
numbers

06:09:59.810 --> 06:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
06:10:01.490 --> 06:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
if I take that high number and just
 
06:10:03.948 --> 06:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
leave it as is 56 000 and say that's a
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
high number so that'd be like a high
 
06:10:05.400 --> 06:10:06.590 align:start position:0%
high number so that'd be like a high
estimate

06:10:06.590 --> 06:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
um that's a substantially more than the
 
06:10:10.010 --> 06:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
38 000 we're carrying currently in the
 
06:10:11.930 --> 06:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
formula and if I run both those numbers
 
06:10:14.750 --> 06:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
and the impact on adequacy
 
06:10:16.190 --> 06:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
um it would run through our formula I
 
06:10:17.690 --> 06:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
have about either 22 million dollar
 
06:10:20.690 --> 06:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
estimate or a 42 million dollar estimate
 
06:10:23.390 --> 06:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
um this would impact fiscal year 26 so
 
06:10:25.430 --> 06:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
we'd have a lot of time to
 
06:10:27.170 --> 06:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
know what's coming
 
06:10:29.690 --> 06:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
um if we and if this bill were to pass
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
um but that's currently where I'm at
 
06:10:33.470 --> 06:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's a very ballpark figure it's very
 
06:10:36.530 --> 06:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
difficult to estimate fiscal year 26. we
 
06:10:38.810 --> 06:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
normally don't do that but if this
 
06:10:41.090 --> 06:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
program were to pass we're talking about
 
06:10:42.590 --> 06:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know dozens of millions of dollars
 
06:10:44.930 --> 06:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy formula as far as
 
06:10:46.910 --> 06:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
Federal money left on the table I think
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
we talked about this last summer the way
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
Federal money is received by the state
 
06:10:54.770 --> 06:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
by the federal government to the state
 
06:10:56.030 --> 06:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
by the federal government is usually
 
06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
using census data but the way we
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
allocate out to our districts and our
 
06:11:03.350 --> 06:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
communities is done using fnr data so
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's not going to increase
 
06:11:06.530 --> 06:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
I believe I think last time we talked
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
about this I don't think it's going to
 
06:11:09.110 --> 06:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
increase our Perkins allocation I don't
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
think it's going to increase our Title
 
06:11:11.690 --> 06:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
One allocation
 
06:11:13.850 --> 06:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
um but it would increase
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um the number of students eligible
 
06:11:17.570 --> 06:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
eligible for the program and every time
 
06:11:19.190 --> 06:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
that student
 
06:11:21.530 --> 06:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
um accesses that program
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
um instead of paying local sales revenue
 
06:11:26.448 --> 06:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
about lunch money to the district the
 
06:11:28.010 --> 06:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
federal government would pay for it so
 
06:11:29.208 --> 06:11:29.218 align:start position:0%
there would be more Federal money for
 
06:11:31.010 --> 06:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
schools because there would be less
 
06:11:33.350 --> 06:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
lunch money so that's where we would put
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
more Federal money into our schools
 
06:11:37.128 --> 06:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
um it would you know whether the
 
06:11:38.570 --> 06:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
students pay for their lunch some of
 
06:11:40.250 --> 06:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
them might run debts and however that
 
06:11:42.170 --> 06:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
may work but that's that's what the
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
fundraal money would come into play
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether you're having worked at LBA and
 
06:11:48.288 --> 06:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
knowing Mickey are are you going to be
 
06:11:50.208 --> 06:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
able to get some of these spreadsheets
 
06:11:52.730 --> 06:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
developed for us that you know show some
 
06:11:54.708 --> 06:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
of this information you have right now
 
06:11:57.530 --> 06:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
just projecting possibly this is my what
 
06:11:59.570 --> 06:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
it might net Us in terms of funding
 
06:12:02.030 --> 06:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
through the form education formula I can
 
06:12:04.510 --> 06:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
give you a town by town
 
06:12:07.250 --> 06:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
I I'd love just to see it by the state
 
06:12:08.750 --> 06:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
or even if you have by Time by Town
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
that'd be even in regret you I think I'm
 
06:12:13.970 --> 06:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
trying to at this moment in time
 
06:12:13.980 --> 06:12:15.170 align:start position:0%
trying to at this moment in time
um

06:12:15.170 --> 06:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
have Mickey I I I you know if you're if
 
06:12:20.270 --> 06:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do a work session on this I
 
06:12:22.070 --> 06:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
can give you a town by Town um I want
 
06:12:24.110 --> 06:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
Mickey to put eyes on it I prefer but um
 
06:12:25.850 --> 06:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
if you want to tell my town I have the
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
data so okay fine if you could be
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
working on that we're going to have some
 
06:12:32.270 --> 06:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a session on that in about a
 
06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
week or so okay
 
06:12:36.288 --> 06:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
so it'd be good to have that so we can
 
06:12:38.150 --> 06:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
have that in the discussion further
 
06:12:39.230 --> 06:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:12:41.628 --> 06:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you uh
 
06:12:43.730 --> 06:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
maybe this is for you Mr chairman but uh
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
maybe my question would um a request
 
06:12:47.690 --> 06:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
would be better held off into the work
 
06:12:50.570 --> 06:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
session I'd like to talk about the data
 
06:12:54.170 --> 06:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
matching process would maybe the work
 
06:12:58.190 --> 06:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:00.350 --> 06:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay why don't you hang on to that one
 
06:13:03.770 --> 06:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
then so uh representative Woodcock thank
 
06:13:05.930 --> 06:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
you chairman good afternoon gentlemen um
 
06:13:08.208 --> 06:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
just some clarification if I may Mark
 
06:13:10.368 --> 06:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the direct
 
06:13:11.930 --> 06:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
certification that Kelly had been
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
talking about you mentioned that it
 
06:13:18.350 --> 06:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
brought everyone to free uh meals does
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
that negate the the reduced meal
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so our current programs bring
 
06:13:26.090 --> 06:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
everyone to free our understanding and
 
06:13:28.430 --> 06:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
and we've we've done we've talked to
 
06:13:29.930 --> 06:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
we've had some meetings with USDA we
 
06:13:31.910 --> 06:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually had a conversation uh Jen was
 
06:13:33.230 --> 06:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
involved in it have a conversation with
 
06:13:35.090 --> 06:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts our understanding is the
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
way the Medicaid Program is that
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
actually parses out free and reduced so
 
06:13:40.910 --> 06:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
direct certification usually lumps
 
06:13:42.830 --> 06:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
everyone into free the Medicaid direct
 
06:13:45.890 --> 06:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
sir program as authorized by USDA allows
 
06:13:48.708 --> 06:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
for granularity and parsing out free and
 
06:13:48.718 --> 06:13:51.730 align:start position:0%
for granularity and parsing out free and
reduced

06:13:51.730 --> 06:13:51.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:13:56.990 --> 06:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
um on the non-uh Medicaid application uh
 
06:13:59.208 --> 06:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
not the snap many of the processes is
 
06:14:02.288 --> 06:14:02.298 align:start position:0%
there still going to be a option for
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
parents of youngsters that don't
 
06:14:06.890 --> 06:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
currently on Medicaid and are
 
06:14:08.410 --> 06:14:08.420 align:start position:0%
participating in any
 
06:14:11.930 --> 06:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh you know my kids can I can I'm not
 
06:14:13.788 --> 06:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
participating anything can I can I fill
 
06:14:16.250 --> 06:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
out paperwork for my daughter and son
 
06:14:18.830 --> 06:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
so I think if this were to be Bill were
 
06:14:21.288 --> 06:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
to become law and we were to access the
 
06:14:23.390 --> 06:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
program be approved for the program I
 
06:14:25.610 --> 06:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
think the default policy by the
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
department would probably be to still
 
06:14:28.310 --> 06:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
allow applications well meaning we're
 
06:14:30.590 --> 06:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
not letting the applications go away
 
06:14:30.600 --> 06:14:31.250 align:start position:0%
not letting the applications go away
um

06:14:31.250 --> 06:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:33.410 --> 06:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I believe last time we
 
06:14:34.610 --> 06:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
talked to them
 
06:14:37.010 --> 06:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
they've done direct cert right and they
 
06:14:38.690 --> 06:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
they feel that I think they must feel
 
06:14:40.368 --> 06:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
that they've done it to just an extent
 
06:14:41.390 --> 06:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
that they've gotten rid of applications
 
06:14:41.400 --> 06:14:42.410 align:start position:0%
that they've gotten rid of applications
okay

06:14:42.410 --> 06:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:44.090 --> 06:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
um so that would be probably a
 
06:14:46.368 --> 06:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
legislative policy decision as far as do
 
06:14:47.390 --> 06:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
you actually want to get rid of the
 
06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
applications I mean only rely on Direct
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
certification but I think probably the
 
06:14:53.448 --> 06:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
department would still allow the option
 
06:14:55.788 --> 06:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
for applications you could have someone
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
who's in poverty but has private
 
06:14:58.558 --> 06:14:59.448 align:start position:0%
who's in poverty but has private
insurance

06:14:59.448 --> 06:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:15:03.048 --> 06:15:03.058 align:start position:0%
um okay maybe so first let me have just
 
06:15:04.730 --> 06:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
one more sure thank you
 
06:15:07.788 --> 06:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
um the last one hopefully uh there's
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
been uh the eligibility you're talking
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
about the 130 and 187 that eligibility
 
06:15:15.590 --> 06:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
is state number right that's a state
 
06:15:18.170 --> 06:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
eligibility number I think it's a
 
06:15:22.670 --> 06:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
federal guideline 135 185 so 185 185 187
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
the 130 and the 185 or the 187 that
 
06:15:27.048 --> 06:15:27.058 align:start position:0%
number that's that's a federal guideline
 
06:15:30.350 --> 06:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay is it regulated by the state at
 
06:15:33.230 --> 06:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
all in this in the in the uh the school
 
06:15:35.330 --> 06:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
of state board has the right to you
 
06:15:38.750 --> 06:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
regulate that is that correct uh
 
06:15:41.390 --> 06:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question for Kelly
 
06:15:44.208 --> 06:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
um the state apparently has some
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
Authority in a sense we just moved uh we
 
06:15:50.448 --> 06:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
just changed snap eligibility uh I think
 
06:15:53.208 --> 06:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
I think probably the application I'm
 
06:15:56.208 --> 06:15:56.218 align:start position:0%
just speculating here the application I
 
06:15:57.770 --> 06:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
think is really highly governed by the
 
06:15:59.570 --> 06:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
federal government but our feed-in
 
06:16:01.548 --> 06:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
programs like snap we did change that to
 
06:16:03.890 --> 06:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
200 percent right and that's going to
 
06:16:06.890 --> 06:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
trigger increased direct certs okay um
 
06:16:08.810 --> 06:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
so I I think the application might be
 
06:16:10.850 --> 06:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
fully governed by the federal federal
 
06:16:13.368 --> 06:16:13.378 align:start position:0%
regulations we might be stuck to that
 
06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
but um that that's my guess may I just
 
06:16:18.470 --> 06:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
fall sure where I'm going with that
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you is we have a bill that's
 
06:16:23.270 --> 06:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
coming forward that's looking at
 
06:16:26.330 --> 06:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
um based on the from the summer meals
 
06:16:28.730 --> 06:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
program no site based on the assumption
 
06:16:31.430 --> 06:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
that the under the rules we saw the
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education has the right
 
06:16:35.448 --> 06:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
although they haven't they have the
 
06:16:38.690 --> 06:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
right to increase the eligibility so
 
06:16:40.610 --> 06:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
bill that was coming forward was looking
 
06:16:42.410 --> 06:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
at increasing the eligibility for free
 
06:16:45.350 --> 06:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
agent's launch up to 300 percent
 
06:16:47.570 --> 06:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay of the federal guidelines so my
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
question is
 
06:16:51.230 --> 06:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
um here you talk now how it's regulated
 
06:16:54.288 --> 06:16:54.298 align:start position:0%
with that with the direct certification
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
under the Medicaid process uh
 
06:17:00.110 --> 06:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
just negate that or it was just a waste
 
06:17:02.750 --> 06:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
or it it just won't fly
 
06:17:04.850 --> 06:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know and now I think my my
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
assumption that this program's highly
 
06:17:09.770 --> 06:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
federally regulated because the federal
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
money it's a lot of federal money it's
 
06:17:13.368 --> 06:17:13.378 align:start position:0%
more mostly federally funded the f r
 
06:17:13.378 --> 06:17:14.628 align:start position:0%
more mostly federally funded the f r
program

06:17:14.628 --> 06:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:17:16.250 --> 06:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I could be totally wrong there could
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
be some some policy quirks there that I
 
06:17:18.890 --> 06:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
06:17:20.208 --> 06:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
um so I can't answer that question
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's um maybe the DHS I don't know I
 
06:17:26.570 --> 06:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on that was what I
 
06:17:27.890 --> 06:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
was going to ask you for is what's the
 
06:17:29.030 --> 06:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh the build number on that so I can
 
06:17:31.610 --> 06:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:36.368 --> 06:17:36.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.610 --> 06:17:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:45.350 --> 06:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
I probably responsively having a lapse
 
06:17:46.270 --> 06:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
over here
 
06:17:48.830 --> 06:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
anyhow we will get you that okay okay
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
but the the bill that has um the
 
06:17:53.390 --> 06:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
dialogue from the summer talked about oh
 
06:17:55.090 --> 06:17:55.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:57.770 --> 06:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh so that that was the question and
 
06:18:00.170 --> 06:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to do I mean our our
 
06:18:03.048 --> 06:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
goal uh like representative Lads goal of
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
this goal is increase the participation
 
06:18:07.548 --> 06:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
rate particularly those that
 
06:18:10.190 --> 06:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
um can't do fully have not been eligible
 
06:18:11.750 --> 06:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
um but in the Mystic guidelines we're
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
lowering the costs and the increases of
 
06:18:16.368 --> 06:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
everything today we're hoping to expand
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
those that are eligible people from
 
06:18:19.910 --> 06:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
Middle have made it before at the 180.
 
06:18:21.890 --> 06:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of the bill but what
 
06:18:23.628 --> 06:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do uh I'm speaking
 
06:18:25.610 --> 06:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
myself assuming collectively for the
 
06:18:27.350 --> 06:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
meal committee what we don't want to do
 
06:18:30.948 --> 06:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
is is uh follow it up so to screw up the
 
06:18:32.448 --> 06:18:32.458 align:start position:0%
whole process if you know what I mean
 
06:18:34.868 --> 06:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
yep yeah I'll take a look at that yeah
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
education on that thank you thank you
 
06:18:38.208 --> 06:18:38.218 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate that thank
 
06:18:39.708 --> 06:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
you we have uh you talk about
 
06:18:41.868 --> 06:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what about Maine Rhode
 
06:18:45.410 --> 06:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
Island you know Vermont the ones other
 
06:18:47.930 --> 06:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
New England states here are they we
 
06:18:50.930 --> 06:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
heard I think some meant 30 states are
 
06:18:52.368 --> 06:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
in this program
 
06:18:53.708 --> 06:18:53.718 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
06:18:56.990 --> 06:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
39 Okay so
 
06:18:58.310 --> 06:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah there must be some other New
 
06:19:01.368 --> 06:19:01.378 align:start position:0%
England states are in it as well
 
06:19:02.750 --> 06:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we've only chatted with
 
06:19:06.110 --> 06:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts about a year ago okay
 
06:19:08.810 --> 06:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:19:11.390 --> 06:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
06:19:13.010 --> 06:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question does
 
06:19:18.350 --> 06:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
either one of you have even if it's you
 
06:19:21.048 --> 06:19:21.058 align:start position:0%
know a generalized idea
 
06:19:22.970 --> 06:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
how many
 
06:19:26.690 --> 06:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
students there may be who
 
06:19:28.850 --> 06:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
don't have Medicaid
 
06:19:30.530 --> 06:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
even though they don't qualify or they
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
simply haven't applied
 
06:19:35.750 --> 06:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
um may or may not have some other health
 
06:19:37.070 --> 06:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
insurance maybe through a parent's
 
06:19:37.080 --> 06:19:38.270 align:start position:0%
insurance maybe through a parent's
employer

06:19:38.270 --> 06:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
employer
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
but would qualify for free and reduced
 
06:19:40.440 --> 06:19:41.628 align:start position:0%
but would qualify for free and reduced
lunch

06:19:41.628 --> 06:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
06:19:44.048 --> 06:19:44.058 align:start position:0%
in other words what's the gap
 
06:19:46.190 --> 06:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
so I was actually thinking about that
 
06:19:47.448 --> 06:19:47.458 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure if the department
 
06:19:48.948 --> 06:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
would be able to capture that because
 
06:19:51.230 --> 06:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have any data on any
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
individual who's not
 
06:19:56.810 --> 06:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
um snap or TANF or Medicaid so I was
 
06:19:58.190 --> 06:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about that question though and
 
06:20:00.288 --> 06:20:00.298 align:start position:0%
I will ask if we do have an ability to
 
06:20:02.330 --> 06:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
capture that somehow I would doubt it
 
06:20:03.948 --> 06:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
given that that we probably don't have
 
06:20:05.448 --> 06:20:05.458 align:start position:0%
numbers on that
 
06:20:07.548 --> 06:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the effort
 
06:20:10.930 --> 06:20:10.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you said we had about roughly
 
06:20:15.530 --> 06:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
56 38 47 000 kids possibly uh what are
 
06:20:17.570 --> 06:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
we doing what's the adult population if
 
06:20:19.548 --> 06:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
I had the adults on top of these kids in
 
06:20:22.670 --> 06:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
grades 5 through 18. ages 5 to 18. so I
 
06:20:23.868 --> 06:20:23.878 align:start position:0%
was looking at the numbers this morning
 
06:20:26.930 --> 06:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
total Medicaid at the moment is around
 
06:20:30.650 --> 06:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
250 000. now that is
 
06:20:32.690 --> 06:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
um inflated because of the public health
 
06:20:34.010 --> 06:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
emergency and the maintenance of effort
 
06:20:34.020 --> 06:20:35.390 align:start position:0%
emergency and the maintenance of effort
requirements

06:20:35.390 --> 06:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:20:37.850 --> 06:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
um come April 1st we will start to be
 
06:20:39.410 --> 06:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
able to
 
06:20:39.420 --> 06:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
able to
um

06:20:41.030 --> 06:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:42.530 --> 06:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the proper word for
 
06:20:45.530 --> 06:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
it is but look at eligibility and assess
 
06:20:47.868 --> 06:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
properly thank you
 
06:20:49.250 --> 06:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
are there any other other questions
 
06:20:50.390 --> 06:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
right in the yes represent
 
06:20:52.970 --> 06:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
06:20:55.310 --> 06:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:20:57.650 --> 06:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
question you had referred to in
 
06:21:00.470 --> 06:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
answering my earlier question
 
06:21:00.480 --> 06:21:02.208 align:start position:0%
answering my earlier question
um

06:21:02.208 --> 06:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:05.690 --> 06:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:05.700 --> 06:21:07.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:21:07.128 --> 06:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:10.490 --> 06:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
is that federally governed or state
 
06:21:12.708 --> 06:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
governed and is that something we could
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
change at the state level so that there
 
06:21:19.368 --> 06:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
could be sharing from State Medicaid you
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
know between that and the doe as far as
 
06:21:24.170 --> 06:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
doing our own direct certification like
 
06:21:27.110 --> 06:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
we do with TANF and WIC and those other
 
06:21:27.120 --> 06:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
we do with TANF and WIC and those other
things

06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
that would have to be something we have
 
06:21:31.368 --> 06:21:31.378 align:start position:0%
to really look at when we go through a
 
06:21:32.810 --> 06:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
data sharing process at the department
 
06:21:35.570 --> 06:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
we we look at all the available
 
06:21:37.010 --> 06:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
authorities we go from the federal
 
06:21:39.470 --> 06:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
government to the extent it's a federal
 
06:21:41.090 --> 06:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
um federally funded or you know
 
06:21:42.650 --> 06:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
federally involved program we look at
 
06:21:44.390 --> 06:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
the state Authority and we look at
 
06:21:46.868 --> 06:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
things like that so it's it's a rather
 
06:21:49.368 --> 06:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
involved and
 
06:21:49.378 --> 06:21:50.990 align:start position:0%
involved and
um

06:21:50.990 --> 06:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:53.868 --> 06:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
you know a long process in terms of when
 
06:21:55.610 --> 06:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
we decide how we share data and how
 
06:21:56.990 --> 06:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it so that's something
 
06:21:59.150 --> 06:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
we could certainly take a look at
 
06:22:01.610 --> 06:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
um you know our understanding is that
 
06:22:04.670 --> 06:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data really has to be protected
 
06:22:06.490 --> 06:22:06.500 align:start position:0%
absent some sort of federal Authority
 
06:22:09.010 --> 06:22:09.020 align:start position:0%
but we can we can certainly take a look
 
06:22:11.330 --> 06:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we're going to have
 
06:22:12.830 --> 06:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
one more question represent Damon that's
 
06:22:14.390 --> 06:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
the last one
 
06:22:16.310 --> 06:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you it's short
 
06:22:20.330 --> 06:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to hopefully verify I
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe the federal Omnibus act that was
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
passed at the end of 22
 
06:22:25.798 --> 06:22:26.570 align:start position:0%
passed at the end of 22
um

06:22:26.570 --> 06:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:29.090 --> 06:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
will continue Medicaid certification for
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
children that they'll have continuous
 
06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment are you familiar with that I
 
06:22:34.548 --> 06:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
am familiar with that I'm trying to
 
06:22:36.830 --> 06:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
remember the provision though I it
 
06:22:39.288 --> 06:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
sounds familiar to me I think that
 
06:22:39.298 --> 06:22:41.690 align:start position:0%
sounds familiar to me I think that
um begins

06:22:41.690 --> 06:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
um begins
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
I want to say next January yes I think
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
so too so the reason I brought it up was
 
06:22:49.368 --> 06:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
just that that would be relevant to what
 
06:22:51.410 --> 06:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
happens with this that kids wouldn't
 
06:22:53.030 --> 06:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
fall off Medicaid and therefore they
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't fall off yes they continuously
 
06:22:59.090 --> 06:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill went through thank you
 
06:23:01.548 --> 06:23:01.558 align:start position:0%
and no more questions uh for the
 
06:23:04.070 --> 06:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
Department for HHS we have a work
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%

06:23:10.670 --> 06:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:13.548 --> 06:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
yes I I've written that down and I have
 
06:23:14.930 --> 06:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
these questions and I'll be working on
 
06:23:17.448 --> 06:23:17.458 align:start position:0%
getting some answers for everybody for
 
06:23:19.970 --> 06:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
that day and and if Kelly could also you
 
06:23:22.310 --> 06:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
know be around Mark yep thank you we'll
 
06:23:23.868 --> 06:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
talk about data sharing as well thank
 
06:23:25.128 --> 06:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
you good
 
06:23:27.650 --> 06:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much everybody I don't
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards on this bill
 
06:23:33.650 --> 06:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close the hearing on 601
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
and take about five minutes to stretch
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then we have one smaller bill here
 
06:23:39.470 --> 06:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
which we have representing lunos taking
 
06:23:44.270 --> 06:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.128 --> 06:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
okay so I noticed you asked him to be on
 
06:23:48.610 --> 06:23:48.620 align:start position:0%
the social studies thing this is a young
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
I just asked him I want to get in
 
06:23:52.128 --> 06:23:52.138 align:start position:0%
contact with him and I hear something
 
06:23:53.830 --> 06:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
like that yeah
 
06:23:58.448 --> 06:23:58.458 align:start position:0%
shake Advantage she's really okay
 
06:23:58.458 --> 06:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
shake Advantage she's really okay
okay

06:33:12.288 --> 06:33:12.298 align:start position:0%
our last bill in front of us here so
 
06:33:15.250 --> 06:33:15.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead
 
06:33:19.490 --> 06:33:19.500 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you very much Mr chair
 
06:33:28.730 --> 06:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's been uh been wonderful to be with
 
06:33:30.650 --> 06:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh with everybody in House Education
 
06:33:32.750 --> 06:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
06:33:34.788 --> 06:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
um uh for the record uh Dave luno
 
06:33:37.970 --> 06:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County District 9 uh the
 
06:33:40.128 --> 06:33:40.138 align:start position:0%
people of Bowen Hopkinton and all over
 
06:33:42.410 --> 06:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
the great Granite State
 
06:33:45.230 --> 06:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
um uh here to introduce House Bill 435
 
06:33:48.048 --> 06:33:48.058 align:start position:0%
this came to me at the request of the
 
06:33:51.110 --> 06:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
department and um and we've got Mark
 
06:33:52.850 --> 06:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
mancinella who's going to be be here
 
06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
from the Department to uh to speak in
 
06:33:58.070 --> 06:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
just a minute to uh back to the enhanced
 
06:34:01.850 --> 06:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch grants that
 
06:34:05.208 --> 06:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
um uh that came in as part of the the
 
06:34:07.970 --> 06:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
state budget uh I believe came in as
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
part of the state budget it updates the
 
06:34:13.970 --> 06:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
the grant levels based on based on where
 
06:34:15.288 --> 06:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
where those level
 
06:34:18.830 --> 06:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh should be at this point it eliminates
 
06:34:22.430 --> 06:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
the proration clause in the um in the
 
06:34:24.770 --> 06:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
statute and it adds a biennial cost
 
06:34:27.590 --> 06:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh so that we can basically
 
06:34:30.110 --> 06:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
get this set and um and let this uh
 
06:34:32.090 --> 06:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
continue to run so with that that
 
06:34:34.250 --> 06:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
concludes my quick introduction remarks
 
06:34:36.890 --> 06:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I just soon handed over to to the
 
06:34:40.250 --> 06:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
department for uh technical
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions uh
 
06:34:44.030 --> 06:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
06:34:46.670 --> 06:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
great thank you all very much thank you
 
06:34:46.680 --> 06:34:56.390 align:start position:0%
great thank you all very much thank you
yeah

06:34:56.390 --> 06:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:56.400 --> 06:34:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

06:34:57.590 --> 06:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:34:59.628 --> 06:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh for the record marketing hello
 
06:35:02.090 --> 06:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education School Finance
 
06:35:04.250 --> 06:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the reason why what this bill is
 
06:35:05.930 --> 06:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
doing two things it's adjusting the
 
06:35:09.230 --> 06:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
rates and then it's getting rid of the
 
06:35:12.048 --> 06:35:12.058 align:start position:0%
um set in stone proration number so the
 
06:35:14.150 --> 06:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
way the relief aid grant works is we
 
06:35:16.610 --> 06:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
calculate your Aid amount based on your
 
06:35:19.430 --> 06:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
fnr percentage for each community and if
 
06:35:21.350 --> 06:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
we come up with that number
 
06:35:23.510 --> 06:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um but we don't use that number well we
 
06:35:25.670 --> 06:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
use that number what we do is we prorate
 
06:35:30.230 --> 06:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
up or down to 17.5 million so if we do
 
06:35:32.208 --> 06:35:32.218 align:start position:0%
the calculation and Statewide it turns
 
06:35:34.610 --> 06:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
out to be 15 million we are going to Pro
 
06:35:36.650 --> 06:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
jump every Community up well I should do
 
06:35:38.510 --> 06:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
some easier math I'm not gonna we'll
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
jump it up to uh we'll jump it up by
 
06:35:42.230 --> 06:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
whatever percentage the increase is
 
06:35:44.570 --> 06:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
necessary to bring it up to 17.5 million
 
06:35:47.510 --> 06:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
if we calculate if we do the math do it
 
06:35:48.948 --> 06:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
on the formula and it turns out to be 20
 
06:35:51.410 --> 06:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
million we'll throw it everyone down to
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
whatever percentage so that the
 
06:35:55.490 --> 06:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide total is 17.5 million and so
 
06:35:57.048 --> 06:35:57.058 align:start position:0%
what's good about that is it creates a
 
06:35:58.610 --> 06:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
budget control creates a budget control
 
06:36:00.110 --> 06:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
for Budget writers that they know
 
06:36:01.490 --> 06:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
exactly how much they're going to spend
 
06:36:02.690 --> 06:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
exactly how much they're going to spend
 
06:36:05.990 --> 06:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
is 17.5 million but as we become more
 
06:36:08.930 --> 06:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the fnr date fnr data
 
06:36:11.090 --> 06:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
or this calculation and what this will
 
06:36:11.100 --> 06:36:12.110 align:start position:0%
or this calculation and what this will
do

06:36:12.110 --> 06:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:36:14.448 --> 06:36:14.458 align:start position:0%
um we would like to ideally have these
 
06:36:17.510 --> 06:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
formulas stand alone and float and not
 
06:36:20.930 --> 06:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
be anchored to a proration number
 
06:36:22.850 --> 06:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and the reason why that works is
 
06:36:22.860 --> 06:36:24.530 align:start position:0%
um and the reason why that works is
because

06:36:24.530 --> 06:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:36:27.770 --> 06:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
um it really we do have 30 cooperatives
 
06:36:29.270 --> 06:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
all cooperatives have a Cooperative
 
06:36:31.128 --> 06:36:31.138 align:start position:0%
apportionment and when we are doing
 
06:36:33.708 --> 06:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
Cooperative apportionments we account
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
for every single well not every single
 
06:36:37.190 --> 06:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
penny we don't do it to the penny we do
 
06:36:38.690 --> 06:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
everything can we count to every single
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
dollar of adequacy funding to go to each
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
Community each Town that's in a
 
06:36:47.090 --> 06:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
um in a Cooperative apportionment and so
 
06:36:48.530 --> 06:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
when we change the school funding
 
06:36:48.540 --> 06:36:49.548 align:start position:0%
when we change the school funding
formula

06:36:49.548 --> 06:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
formula
 
06:36:51.708 --> 06:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
with relief aid meaning
 
06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
um the fnr data manipul changes for one
 
06:36:57.708 --> 06:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
Community by one kid it changes it for
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
all 233 towns if all 233 towns were
 
06:37:03.110 --> 06:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for this so that means there's
 
06:37:05.390 --> 06:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
about a dollar change for all of these
 
06:37:07.430 --> 06:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
towns and it creates more administrative
 
06:37:09.170 --> 06:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
work because now we have to account for
 
06:37:10.670 --> 06:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
all those dollar changes on every
 
06:37:12.770 --> 06:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
Cooperative apportionment so it's just a
 
06:37:14.208 --> 06:37:14.218 align:start position:0%
lot more keying
 
06:37:15.590 --> 06:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
um because now every single Community
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
has a change in their adequacy
 
06:37:18.360 --> 06:37:19.250 align:start position:0%
has a change in their adequacy
um

06:37:19.250 --> 06:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:21.048 --> 06:37:21.058 align:start position:0%
um relative to what we use to set the
 
06:37:22.128 --> 06:37:22.138 align:start position:0%
tax rate and what they were actually
 
06:37:23.810 --> 06:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
paid and it comes into the Cooperative
 
06:37:25.310 --> 06:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
apportional process so it's really
 
06:37:26.628 --> 06:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes
 
06:37:29.330 --> 06:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
um uh inside baseball but when me and my
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
team have to do Cooperative
 
06:37:32.208 --> 06:37:32.218 align:start position:0%
apportionments it becomes very sort of
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
tedious tracking every single dollar
 
06:37:33.840 --> 06:37:35.208 align:start position:0%
tedious tracking every single dollar
change

06:37:35.208 --> 06:37:35.218 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:37:36.948 --> 06:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
um because in the proration is causing
 
06:37:38.570 --> 06:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
that dollar change
 
06:37:41.150 --> 06:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so if we let the formula float
 
06:37:43.850 --> 06:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
um we we bring it to a 17.5 million
 
06:37:45.410 --> 06:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
dollar number
 
06:37:45.420 --> 06:37:46.368 align:start position:0%
dollar number
um

06:37:46.368 --> 06:37:46.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:49.730 --> 06:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
using uh just changing the rates not
 
06:37:51.708 --> 06:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
using a proration factor
 
06:37:53.150 --> 06:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be administratively
 
06:37:56.750 --> 06:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:58.670 --> 06:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:04.610 --> 06:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
um does this affect overall the budget
 
06:38:09.350 --> 06:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the state or does it just does it
 
06:38:11.090 --> 06:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
even out
 
06:38:13.970 --> 06:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
so when I first did this calculation and
 
06:38:16.490 --> 06:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
handed this to representative luno it
 
06:38:19.010 --> 06:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
did not now looking at the latest data
 
06:38:21.708 --> 06:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
it actually is going to be I did the
 
06:38:23.090 --> 06:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
latest I'd use these numbers that I have
 
06:38:24.530 --> 06:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
figured in here
 
06:38:27.350 --> 06:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
um it's 500 000 less so if you were to
 
06:38:30.110 --> 06:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
send this bill to finance we could take
 
06:38:31.788 --> 06:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
the latest data and try to bring this
 
06:38:33.948 --> 06:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
closer to completely state budget
 
06:38:36.708 --> 06:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
neutral right now it's um a 500 000
 
06:38:36.718 --> 06:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
neutral right now it's um a 500 000
savings

06:38:38.390 --> 06:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
savings
 
06:38:40.548 --> 06:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
um in the state budget but I think as
 
06:38:42.048 --> 06:38:42.058 align:start position:0%
this if this bill made it's a second
 
06:38:43.910 --> 06:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee and we worked uh with binance
 
06:38:45.948 --> 06:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
we would try to bring it right to budget
 
06:38:48.230 --> 06:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
neutral thank you
 
06:38:51.048 --> 06:38:51.058 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:38:53.810 --> 06:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
06:38:56.090 --> 06:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:38:58.070 --> 06:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
well let me preface this by saying I am
 
06:39:00.230 --> 06:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
not a good numbers person
 
06:39:04.970 --> 06:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
so if right now it's 500 000 less to the
 
06:39:06.590 --> 06:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
state am I correct in thinking that
 
06:39:09.288 --> 06:39:09.298 align:start position:0%
that's 500 000 less to the districts
 
06:39:09.298 --> 06:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
that's 500 000 less to the districts
correct

06:39:11.510 --> 06:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:39:14.150 --> 06:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
and how is it that you would make it be
 
06:39:14.160 --> 06:39:15.770 align:start position:0%
and how is it that you would make it be
neutral

06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I would I would just play with the
 
06:39:19.788 --> 06:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
numbers a little bit so that that's 672
 
06:39:19.798 --> 06:39:22.128 align:start position:0%
numbers a little bit so that that's 672
for

06:39:22.128 --> 06:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:39:24.470 --> 06:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I I followed a I think I followed a
 
06:39:28.128 --> 06:39:28.138 align:start position:0%
four times uh uh so like originally it
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
was 150 to 600 so it's the low end Grant
 
06:39:34.490 --> 06:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
it was 150 and the high end Grant was
 
06:39:36.830 --> 06:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
600. so I would just add another dollar
 
06:39:38.510 --> 06:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
to that low end so if I added that to
 
06:39:41.930 --> 06:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
169 and then I five times it by four
 
06:39:44.350 --> 06:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
um to the top end that would be
 
06:39:46.670 --> 06:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
176. so I would play with those numbers
 
06:39:49.368 --> 06:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
to make the total calculation come up to
 
06:39:50.990 --> 06:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
17.5 million
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
but it's Tinker out of Tinker with the
 
06:39:54.110 --> 06:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
numbers a tad bit
 
06:39:56.570 --> 06:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
06:39:59.330 --> 06:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
so then in subsequent years the number
 
06:40:01.788 --> 06:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
is changing correct based on F and our
 
06:40:01.798 --> 06:40:02.868 align:start position:0%
is changing correct based on F and our
data

06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:40:05.270 --> 06:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't be set in stone to
 
06:40:09.048 --> 06:40:09.058 align:start position:0%
17.5 million so if say we did direct to
 
06:40:10.730 --> 06:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
cert Medicaid
 
06:40:10.740 --> 06:40:11.570 align:start position:0%
cert Medicaid
um

06:40:11.570 --> 06:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:13.250 --> 06:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
in subsequent years the f r numbers
 
06:40:15.410 --> 06:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
might be better than they are currently
 
06:40:17.150 --> 06:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
um so that would make this formula more
 
06:40:17.160 --> 06:40:18.410 align:start position:0%
um so that would make this formula more
expensive

06:40:18.410 --> 06:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
06:40:21.410 --> 06:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
um if the snap program is successful in
 
06:40:23.510 --> 06:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
getting new applicants to direct certify
 
06:40:26.030 --> 06:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
the fnr numbers would go up
 
06:40:28.730 --> 06:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
um so as F and our data moves so would
 
06:40:30.230 --> 06:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
this number move the only other
 
06:40:31.670 --> 06:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment we're making here is we are
 
06:40:34.270 --> 06:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
doing CPI adjustments
 
06:40:38.330 --> 06:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
CPI adjustments to the uh budget numbers
 
06:40:41.330 --> 06:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
there to the factor numbers so we're
 
06:40:43.670 --> 06:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
trying to make it flow with inflation
 
06:40:45.650 --> 06:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
um based on regular adequacy but we're
 
06:40:48.830 --> 06:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
trying to not live within that 17.5 set
 
06:40:51.230 --> 06:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
in stone number and have the formula
 
06:40:52.730 --> 06:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
flow but there is challenges with having
 
06:40:54.470 --> 06:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
a formula float
 
06:40:56.750 --> 06:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
06:40:59.448 --> 06:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:41:01.190 --> 06:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
I thought we were already doing a CPI
 
06:41:03.230 --> 06:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment every biennium
 
06:41:06.470 --> 06:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
um not to the only to base and
 
06:41:09.230 --> 06:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
differentiate okay okay extraordinary
 
06:41:10.670 --> 06:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
needs Grand stabilization none of those
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
are getting CPI guys okay
 
06:41:16.310 --> 06:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:41:18.590 --> 06:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing any I think we're done thank
 
06:41:18.600 --> 06:41:20.030 align:start position:0%
not seeing any I think we're done thank
you

06:41:20.030 --> 06:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:41:23.690 --> 06:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
so and that does conclude this bill
 
06:41:27.110 --> 06:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's closed and
 
06:41:32.390 --> 06:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:34.430 --> 06:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick question I don't know
 
06:41:35.868 --> 06:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
if you know this off the top of your
 
06:41:37.910 --> 06:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
head but I have all the lsrs that have
 
06:41:40.128 --> 06:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
been submitted to education been
 
06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
assigned a house bill number
 
06:41:44.930 --> 06:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yes they have been and you know
 
06:41:47.150 --> 06:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
what that count is out of curiosity well
 
06:41:50.868 --> 06:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
I think it's 91. I I had one that I
 
06:41:53.990 --> 06:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
could not find it it wasn't it was on
 
06:41:57.530 --> 06:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
our list but when I went to the website
 
06:42:00.010 --> 06:42:00.020 align:start position:0%
it was never there
 
06:42:03.590 --> 06:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we found out there was a technical
 
06:42:05.990 --> 06:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
problem over at the with the ti Guys
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
across the street so we did have that
 
06:42:11.030 --> 06:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
one added on today but uh we're also
 
06:42:13.368 --> 06:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
we've also vacated a couple of them so I
 
06:42:14.690 --> 06:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
think that we're hovering right around
 
06:42:18.288 --> 06:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
91 that's not counting any Senate bills
 
06:42:21.530 --> 06:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:26.030 --> 06:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:28.368 --> 06:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
was it 139 last year yeah you got to
 
06:42:31.368 --> 06:42:31.378 align:start position:0%
remember last year we had 139 bills
 
06:42:33.288 --> 06:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
between the house and the Senate between
 
06:42:36.590 --> 06:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate yeah
 
06:42:36.600 --> 06:42:38.690 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate yeah
no

06:42:38.690 --> 06:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:42:40.128 --> 06:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
and wait until we get some of these
 
06:42:43.190 --> 06:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:44.810 --> 06:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
06:42:46.368 --> 06:42:46.378 align:start position:0%
I think we talked about that earlier
 
06:42:46.378 --> 06:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
I think we talked about that earlier
today
