you why don't you come forward to the
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
and let's let's hear that because I my
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
intention is
 
00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:37.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
today good morning Mr chair members of
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
David rodrig assistant commissioner for
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
Transportation one point of of
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
clarification for the committee to to
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
consider is on page three line 10 the
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
portion that refers to Continental
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
Boulevard in uh the town of of marac the
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
word maintenance is is used and the
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
committee may want to consider as to
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not there could be ambiguity
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
in the term maintenance and may want to
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
consider reclassifying the road to a
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
class five Road or keeping it as as
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
written um that's the only point of
 
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
clarification I would I would
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
make so if if to understand is the
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
department suggesting that Continental
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
Boulevard to be reclassified as class
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
five or what what's what's the revision
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
were yes that's what we would ask the
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
consider removing the word
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance replacing maintenance to
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
reclassify yes of Continental Boulevard
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
maramont to become a class
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
five how how would you how would
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
you I would you like it word yeah I'm
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I I was hoping that this would have
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
been taken care of before today so let's
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
well yeah other other than uh the line
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
nine and line 10 is the department in
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with with as it's represented
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
in um this amendment yes we are in
 
00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
in um this amendment yes we are in
agreement

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
okay further questions of the uh yes
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
please R Sam noin thank you could you
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
tell me what that is
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions AB oh excuse me uh please
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
represent B and reclassifying this to a
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
class five Road
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
what what does that
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
actually that that entails changing the
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
the ownership of the road from a class
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
two State Highway that turnpikes um
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
maintains to a class five road that the
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
town of marac would would maintain and
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
to be clear the Department's okay with
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
the language as written we just
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate that that could create some
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in which maintenance
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
responsibles responsibilities being
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
transferred I would agree thank you
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
please representative Abbott yes I just
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to um get a feel for what the
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguity is is would it because of the
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
word maintenance
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
is yes it is and and the RSA defines
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance I believe when it comes to
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of a road when it comes
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
to the different classifications as all
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
inclusive but when we talk about our
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
operations we have maintenance
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
operations we have planning design
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
construction reconstruction and and so
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
forth so the depending on on how it's
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
looked that there can be some question
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
to what that definition is represent
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
pulner so my understanding is that this
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
is a class two Road the Department's
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
actually required to maintain it there's
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
no provision for not maintaining it like
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
there is for class six roads in the
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities is that is that correct
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm anticipating there might
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
be an issue of
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
somebody hits a rod or a pothole who
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
wants to sue the department for not
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining it is
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
that is that something we need that this
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
is intended to address I
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
guess right if if if if this were to say
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
class five all of that would be very
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
very clear um in the
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
when when it says maintenance again I
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
would still read this and could still
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
make the the argument that it means all
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
of the the maintenance including future
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
reconstruction and so forth but I think
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
somebody else could take a contrary
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
argument to that and then we'd be
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the definition of the word
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
where class five is defined in statute
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
as all maintenance
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities further questions of
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
represent CL here okay thank you I just
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
want to be clear and and try to
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
especially explain to any colleagues
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
outside of this chamber if we pass this
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
the way you want it the town of marac
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
will will not only own Continental but
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the maintenance is
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct okay thank
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
you which is which is actually the
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
intent I I'm I'm thinking this is
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
cleaner okay
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
um okay no further questions for the
 
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.230 align:start position:0%
um okay no further questions for the
commissioner

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
right ahead sir so just a for a point of
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
discussion I
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
asked um Karen Davis to help me out
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago this was presented as an
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
ownership chance transfer without
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
delineating that it was a class five
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
roadway so my
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.110 align:start position:0%
roadway so my
concern

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
is does the change of does the change of
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
a class Road based on what we did what
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
this body approved two years ago with me
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
being the sole person in the
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
minority okay how is what how is what
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
this committee did two years ago
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
different from from changing the type of
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
roadway that it exactly is from a class
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
two and moving it to a class 5 because
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not convinced because the
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
language as defined under class five the
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
definition is all traveled highways
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
other than class six that the town or
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
city has the duty to to maintain
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
regularly has the duty that that to me
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
the way that it's written right now or
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
how it proposes to be written doesn't
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's just you're changing a
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
classification of a roadway it's not
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
transferring ownership of the roadway to
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
the town and I'm not going to bore folks
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
with being redundant for my previous
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
comments about how much the town doesn't
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
want the road I I will spare you the
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
details but I think it's what I'm
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
looking at is I'm looking at two
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
competing versions of language that this
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee voted on two years ago and
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
doing something completely different and
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're trying to accomplish
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
in either case I'm going to be against
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
based on what the previous author of
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment who used to sit where you
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
sat Mr chairman and I absolutely respect
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
the expertise that he has had on this
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
commission the contradiction that exists
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
between what was presented this
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
committee two years ago and what is
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
being proposed now thank you thank you
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the question um can I ask the
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
question of the representative real
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
quick go right ahead before I respond um
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
I guess that's this amendment here that
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
was previous of 2022 and that being said
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
could you point out where in this
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
document that page one line three I
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm sorry on the document in
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
front of you page one line three section
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
two where it reads ownership
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
transfer I mean it doesn't get any more
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um a passing of time brings different
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
people to a table which is where we
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
are this table and this chair is not
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
bound by or are these Representatives
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
Bound by the opinion of a chair of the
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
department two years
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
ago it's been
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
clear on this committee for all the
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
years that I have been here whether I
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
sit in this chair to my right or I sit
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
out with the rest of the representatives
 
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.510 align:start position:0%
out with the rest of the representatives
out

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
there that um it has been the position
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
of this committee that the town of
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
miramac many many years ago made a
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
proposal asked for work to be done work
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
was done uh town of marac then made a
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
statement that their debt should have
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
been paid uh which was not a agreed by
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
um this committee over the years with
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of Maintenance and so forth
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
the tolls were taking away from the ends
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
of this road and it has always been
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
clear to me as one person that this
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
section of road should no longer be paid
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
by the turnpike system and we're showing
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
that that uh I believe one of the
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
numbers we saw represent had brought for
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
forward and I believe it was
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
substantiated that was
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
$60,000 a year minimum maintenance and
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
that the uh last Paving of this road was
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
$1.6 Million which is probably $2
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
million uh from my brief understanding
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
of just speaking with the Department
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
here um I can see where our language
 
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:22.510 align:start position:0%
here um I can see where our language
this

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
time um would have created confusion
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
that if if uh if this remains in which I
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
I certainly believe it will and if this
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
passes a house which I certainly believe
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
it will and it does pass and goes to the
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
governor that the word maintenance is
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a boomerang back and forth
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance is is maintenance some
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
potholes is maintenance the is
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance the
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
resurfacing um but whatever whatever
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance is it's a drain from the
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
turnpike system we have less money
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
coming coming in uh if something happens
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
and we go back to less people traveling
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
on that road less and less money to take
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
care of that road so for my
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
position um and I'm open I'm open
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
for um discussion on it turning that
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
road over to class
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
five um seems to make the most sense and
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
takes the road back to clearly stating
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
that this is a town road now if town of
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
meramac as it has been suggested is
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
going to abandon this road and I don't
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to do uh maybe
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
they'll make a Skywalk like they did in
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
Boston uh then that'll be the choice of
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
the town of marac but my my concern here
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
on this committee and chairing this
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
committee is we are bleeding dollars
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
whether it be the turnpike or our own
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
roads and so I I support that represent
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
mels yes this is just for uh members of
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
the committee that weren't here in 2022
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
the reason that this is worded this way
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
is the Pro
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the previous 10-year plan this
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
project that is named here was the
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
removal of some of the toll booths and
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
we this was specifically worded to tie
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
it in with this particular project this
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
particular project no longer exists
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
therefore if it's if it if we want to
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
pass it it needs new wording and that's
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the reason for it I could be wrong on
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
whether it was the uh the toll booth or
 
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
what but it was it was definite part of
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan and it was just an
 
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
removal represent Jack represent Jack uh
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh can we be clear
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
on who owns uh Continental Boulevard
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
currently and that's from the
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
intersection with old rout three all the
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
way down to penu square is that is that
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system land that it's on or is
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
that town
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
land it's it's my belief that that's
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
turnpike would own the right of way for
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
that and I would believe it's a a fee
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
right of way and not an easement but I
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
have not confirmed that so then follow
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
up so then it would be critical that we
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership to the town uh which
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
is not in the amendment that we have
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
here so that it it ceases to be Turnpike
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
landed becomes Town land so classify so
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
we have to both transfer ownership and
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
then reclassify the road as class five
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
is that is that what we need to do it's
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding that reclassifying the
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
road also
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
reclassifies the the underlying property
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
easement and thank you um and just to to
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.269 align:start position:0%
easement and thank you um and just to to
clarify

00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bill as proposed to be amended
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
which would take that to a class five
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
Road class five Road clearly states that
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
this is no longer a Turnpike Road and
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
that this is a Town Road that's correct
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you rson Boyd I apologize for
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
