00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
931 we will start the public hearing on
 
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
HB 93.
 
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 align:start position:0%
oops yes and first thing we need to do
 
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
public for which it stands one nation
 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
okay so with that
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
like to start open public hearing on HB
 
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
93 authorizing municipalities to reduce
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
speed limits seasonally
 
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
and the chair like to recognize the
 
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
representative uh Abel who is uh the
 
00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman and committee
 
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
members my name is Karen Ebel I'm here
 
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh representing Merrimack District 7
 
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
which is uh New London and Newbury
 
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
so the bill that you have before you
 
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
is actually an attempt to give towns
 
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 align:start position:0%
parallel authority to the authority that
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
the state has under our statutes and
 
00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
that is that a town should be authorized
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
seasonally to reduce the speed limit
 
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
below 25 to 20 miles an hour either at
 
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
its own
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
under its own volition or upon Petition
 
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
of um of folks that live along a road
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
that they consider has safety issues and
 
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
they would like to reduce the speed
 
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.550 align:start position:0%
they would like to reduce the speed
limit

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.830 align:start position:0%
limit
um

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
the petition
 
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
um procedure would be that uh 10
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
residents could petition a town to
 
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
consider the reduction of the speed
 
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
limit from 25 to 20 and then the town in
 
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
consultation with the petitioners
 
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.369 align:start position:0%
consultation with the petitioners
um

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
can decide whether they think that
 
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable and appropriate
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
thing to do and then they would have to
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
write to the petitioners to to let them
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
know what their decision is the
 
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
situation came up in my district in
 
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
particular we have many water bodies in
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
our district as many of you do and you
 
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
know that along those water bodies the
 
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
engineers and their wisdom in the old
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
days decided to put Lakes right along
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
and put roads right along Lake Shores
 
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 align:start position:0%
many of those roads are narrow
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
Meandering and they have cottages on one
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
side many of the roads are through roads
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
but they're also very very popular for
 
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
pedestrians for bike riders for runners
 
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
for dog walkers and in the summer in
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
particular they can get really congested
 
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.749 align:start position:0%
particular they can get really congested
and

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.189 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
towns need quite a few Tools in their
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
toolbox to try to figure out how to
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
reduce the speed and increase the safety
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
on these roads and as we were discussing
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
this in our town we could do signage we
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
could do any number of things but when
 
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
the discussion arose that maybe we could
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the speed limit for 20 from 25
 
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
miles an hour to 20 we found out that
 
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
even though the state can do this we
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
towns cannot so it was brought to my
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
attention actually our town had reached
 
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
out to dot at that point and it was
 
00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention by Bill Lambert
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
who was at the D.O.T and he suggested to
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
me and our Town Administrator that if we
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
were interested in trying to rectify
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
this issue this was the sort of Bill
 
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
that had to be introduced used to bring
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
it before the transportation committee
 
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 align:start position:0%
and he helped me with the language
 
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Lambert is traveling today he can't
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
be here but a representative from dot is
 
00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
here and she will provide you with a
 
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
letter from from Dot
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to speak a little bit
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
about the authority that the state has
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
many of you may know Senator Nancy
 
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
Stiles worked for quite a while on this
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
issue in Hampton and in Hampton there's
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
a state road that goes along the beach
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of interest in the
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
town of Hampton as I understand it to be
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
able to reduce the speed limit and in
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
that case the state can consider the
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
reduction of the speed limit seasonally
 
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 align:start position:0%
upon Petition of the governing
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
municipality so what I did was with the
 
00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 align:start position:0%
assistance of dot I basically paralleled
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
my bill to that the only difference is I
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
didn't want a town to have to wait until
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
there was a petition to make this
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
decision I wanted the town to be able to
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
do it itself if it wanted to so the only
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
other thing I would add is that this
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
would be at no cost to the state any
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
signage would have to be borne by the
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
town but it would have to be approved by
 
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.010 align:start position:0%
town but it would have to be approved by
dot

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
dot
 
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
dot
um

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll I'd be happy to take
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
any questions to the extent my expertise
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
in these matters allow
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much any
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:53.029 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
would this only be on town or city-owned
 
00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:00.139 align:start position:0%
roads through going through the
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
municipality yes
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
municipally owned roads and uh class
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
five I believe
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
um right I mean it's an interesting
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
situation that in some cases the roads
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
that are could be affected like along a
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
lake part of them may be owned by the
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
town and part of them may be owned by
 
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
the state and so there's a petition
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
process to reduce the speed limit for
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
the state but there was really nothing
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
for the town so this would enable some
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
homogeneous speed
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
limits along a lake where that occurs
 
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
limits along a lake where that occurs
follow-up

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and when you say seasonal help
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
me with that term please you know in my
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
mind in New Hampshire I mean it was in
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
our area it's summer that's when people
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
are I mean it could be I don't know in
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
Colebrook they want to do it in the
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
winter time but for for me it would be
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
summer I didn't Define seasonal
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be up to whoever
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
was requesting the the permission but
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
the important part is it's just like it
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
is for the state it's a four-month um
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
window and you can only have one four
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
month window per 12 month period so it's
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
not an across the board authority to
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
reduce it to 20 miles an hour which
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
again tracks what is happening at the
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
state level thank you
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Hill
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
is there any concern on your part or was
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
there consideration for those roads that
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
that may switch back and forth I can
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
think of one in Meredith that switches
 
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:00.500 align:start position:0%
back and forth between two towns twice
 
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:03.980 align:start position:0%
within a a very short
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
period of time and it would seem to me
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
there would need to have to be some
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
coordination between towns or you would
 
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:16.220 align:start position:0%
be accelerating and decelerating quickly
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain the the correct
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
speed was that was that part of this at
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
all uh representative Hill it's a very
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
good question I didn't I thought about
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
the about the state Town dichotomy I
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
have to be honest I didn't
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
think that much about the town Town
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
dichotomy but I would think any town in
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
deciding whether or not it would want to
 
00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:43.459 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
one of the considerations should be that
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
they consult with neighboring towns if
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
their decision affects them
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it should be
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
confusing for
 
00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
the drivers I mean you'll want
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
I guess the only other thing I'd say
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
though is there are many situations in
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
which there are speed limit changes from
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
50 to 35 when you go through a town so
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question I
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that once the
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
process the petition process goes
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
through if there's a speed limit change
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's the four months that's set and then
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
that would stay that way going forward
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
it's not a temporary process it's not
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't revisit it after you know
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
the season that sort of this would be a
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
going forward I mean in my
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
in my mind it would be Revisited
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
huh okay uh but that doesn't mean that
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's 100 correct I mean we could see
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
what the uh What DOT says I mean as I
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
wrote this
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
I would think it would be a recurring
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
thing you know that the towns could uh
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
could reassess it I guess the other
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is if it was
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
originally initiated through a petition
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
process then the town could do it at its
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
own you know volition in the future
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative sellers Mr chair actually
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
I have like five or six questions should
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
I take them one at a time let's start
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
with the first one thank you all right
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to work a little backwards
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
then uh regarding connecting towns with
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
speed limits that you that you didn't
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
think of all right that's okay
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
do they have to get 10 petitioners at
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think any the way this is written any
 
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
I think any the way this is written any
town

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be should be uh the decider as to
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's going to reduce the
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
speed limit on its own Town Road so yes
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
I would think the process would be the
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
same for an adjoining town
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
next question second question thank you
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
since there's uh 10 petitioners would
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
they once they petition the town would
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
they have to have a hearing at all so
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
the other towns people know that this is
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
going on so um I think an important part
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
of the bill the way we wrote it was that
 
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.990 align:start position:0%
of the bill the way we wrote it was that
the

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
um the town would have to consult with
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the petitioners and that I I just can't
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
imagine that that wouldn't be done in
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
the context of a selectman's meeting
 
00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
the context of a selectman's meeting
okay

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
next we'll give you one more all right
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
I'm going to combine them no I won't the
 
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh do you know if there's been any
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
has there been any stats or accidents
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
like that that the reason for just
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
lowering the lowering the speed
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
well I don't
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
I don't personally have statistics I
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
think that might be something that you
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
could discuss with uh with DOT what I do
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
know anecdotally is if people slow down
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
when there's uh pedestrians and dogs uh
 
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
walking on the road that can only help
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
the safety situation I mean I I think
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
we've all observed how these roads
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Meander along lakes and how popular they
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
are for Walkers and you have to reduce
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
actually I have a question in terms of
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
some of these rows that have a speed
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
limit sign already and they decide to
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
reduce it
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
how is handling I guess how is the
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
signage handled do they cover up the
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
initial sign and there's a temporary
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
um well what I've observed in my town is
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
that they put up a a sign that sort of
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
flashes and it would probably say
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
seasonal speed limit reduction 25 miles
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
or 20 miles per hour
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
um there may be people with more
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
expertise on that than what I have but
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
um I think where there's a will there's
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
a way
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Coker thank you Mr
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
chairman um so with this um is there any
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
way for the D.O.T to kind of once this
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
petition makes it to the dot is there
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
any way for the dot to kind of look at
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
it and and for whatever reason rejected
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
or or if there's a compelling reason to
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
do so just to clarify the petition is
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually uh something that would be
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
presented to the municipality and since
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
it's a Town Road it would be the
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
municipalities decision and
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
the place where dot would become
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
involved would be the design and
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
approval of the signage okay so it'd be
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the towns yes I
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
mean because they're town roads Okay so
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
any other further questions from the
 
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.670 align:start position:0%
any other further questions from the
committee

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes yeah
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair actually
 
00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.290 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair actually
um

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
will we be hearing from the D.O.T yes
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'll hold my question for them thank you
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chair could I add one thing I just
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
want to my focus has been Lakeside roads
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
because that's our personal experience I
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
just want I mean in your expertise I
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that this is an
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't just apply to Lakes okay
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you not seeing any further
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
chair like to recognize Kimberly

morning thank you Mr chair and members

of the committee I'm here to speak in
 
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:06.860 align:start position:0%
favor uh in support of this bill
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel was very helpful in
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
bringing this to your attention
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
in New London we have as representative
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
Ebel described Lake roads small windy
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
roads where the population of the summer
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
residents balloons starting in Memorial
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
weekend on and we have people that you
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
may have heard other in other areas
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
speed limit issues around the state and
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
around the country it's a it's a big
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
issue and
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
the worry here in our some of our town
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
roads is that we the Selectmen are not
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
able to lower the speed limits to what
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
they feel would be a safe limit you'll
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
hear from some residents of one of the
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
roads in in New London and they will
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
describe some dangerous situations so
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
when we looked into the law and found
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
that the selectman could not lower it to
 
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
20 miles an hour the thought was that
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
there should be a law to allow Selectmen
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
to the questions of public hearings and
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
things like that I think most towns if
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
even if it wasn't in the law would hold
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings because the idea is that
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
we really want people to know about the
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
change in New London we would put new
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
speed limit signs up the regulation
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
speed limit and we would probably also
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
put something on the speed limit post to
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
point out that these are different
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative evil also suggest we do
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
have electronic signs that would allow
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
the new speed limit to be readily known
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
the idea is that we really want people
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
to do the speed limit if we had people
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
if everybody observed the speed limit we
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have these issues but
 
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the the numbers of people
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
speeding are up so we feel a New London
 
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:55.340 align:start position:0%
that this would help increase the safety
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
of our residents and our visitors to the
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
to the town and that's what we're
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
looking to do
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.930 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you for
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
chair would like to recognize natch
 
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
chair would like to recognize natch
graze

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
graze
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
who is from the nhma did I get that
 
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.510 align:start position:0%
who is from the nhma did I get that
correct

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and requesting two minutes
 
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
who's who's in support of the Bill thank
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
you nature Grace for the municipal
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
Association we do support this bill
 
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't have much to add here I just
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize this isn't only for
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
Lakeside communities it might apply to
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh communities that have uh agriculture
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
during harvest season
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
um and see a lot of parking or walking
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
along roads there hiking skiing snow
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
shoeing Etc and there's certainly plenty
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
of things we do outside here in New
 
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
of things we do outside here in New
Hampshire

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
um just to reiterate a question that
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
that came earlier
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
um this would be for only municipally
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
owned roads which are class four five
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
and six roads
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and it's the way we read it um it's
 
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.270 align:start position:0%
um and it's the way we read it um it's
seasonal

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
seasonal
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and it would be reoccurring but there
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
would be that ability to reassess it to
 
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that this was an appropriate
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
appropriately targeted towards the
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
actual use of the road that's really the
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
the intent here
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
um as far as the signage question goes
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
um municipalities are required of course
 
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539 align:start position:0%
to use the uniform manual on traffic
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
control devices
 
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and I assume based on the fact that
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh dot uses that as well and would be
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
approving any sort of signage that would
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
that would go up that uh there would be
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
clear coordination there so there would
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
not be any confusion about uh what roads
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
are are what the speed limit is On Any
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
Given Road I'm happy to take any
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks um
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
so you represent the municipalities
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide I do thank you so my question
 
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.330 align:start position:0%
Statewide I do thank you so my question
is

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
do they not now and if they have an area
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of pedestrian
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
activity put signs up just to warn
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
people of that no matter what the speed
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
limit is
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
or can they not do that now
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert at uh traffic control
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
devices so I defer to dot on that one I
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
believe I mean just driving around I've
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
seen uh types of signs like that but I I
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what's allowed and what's not
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
allowed so I defer to dot on that one
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
and we have someone from the D.O.T who
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
will be testifying shortly any other
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:42.710 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
you

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to recognize David
 
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.029 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to recognize David
Damaris

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
Damaris
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
um requesting two minutes
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
he's in support of the bill and he's
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
here we are thank you good morning again
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to to
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is David Demers and
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
I live at 586 bunker Road in New London
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh I've spoken on road speed and safety
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our neighbors in the town
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
before our town selectman and also
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
assisted in fundraising and approval for
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
permanent feedback signs uh on our road
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
um as as Kim and Karen had mentioned our
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
road is probably
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps situationally a good example of
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
why we need this bill
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
bunkers erode that follows the perimeter
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
of Pleasant Lake along one side
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
and it's a very old road we've lived on
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
it for nearly 30 years
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
and and the original Road itself was
 
00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:05.539 align:start position:0%
constructed as Kim had mentioned between
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
cottages and has a very very narrow
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
soft shoulder that leads right down into
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
the lake
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh it is an old road as many Lake areas
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
have and it's highly used for
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
multi-purpose on
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
I use this
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
for walkers for runners for bikers and
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
travelers who seek the beauty of
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
Lakeside views in the 30 years that
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
we've lived there the number of people
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
that are using that the lake in that way
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
using that road has risen dramatically
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
and but we also have commuters who
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
travel the same road as a shortcut to
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
town and to in into Route 1 route 89.
 
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:54.539 align:start position:0%
now while the road is currently set at
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
25 miles an hour and to your question
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
about adding signs the town has been
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
very good about adding signs uh warning
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
people about the curves and about the
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
Walkers and uh and and they have been
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
keeping uh some of those feedback signs
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh active but they are rotated up till
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
now in various areas
 
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419 align:start position:0%
we personally observed and the data
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
would show that people try to stay in in
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
that speed limit but the grades on the
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
hill coming into that and once you get
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
into the curves there's not enough
 
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.690 align:start position:0%
into the curves there's not enough
visibility

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:34.700 align:start position:0%
visibility
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
for drivers or for Walkers to see
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
oncoming traffic and because of the the
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
soft shoulders in high periods of use
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
like the spring and summer
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
um drivers who are going too quick can't
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh can't actually maneuver around those
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
people that are there I as an example
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
and to the question about whether or not
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
there are any any observations about
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
driver safety or I'm sorry about uh
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
drivers losing control uh we have
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed a driver losing
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
control of his car at our property one
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
of our our Lots there because he was
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
driving too quick
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
it was a young driver he was likely
 
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
distracted coming through and he
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
careened off the road hitting a tree on
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
our property uh fortunately he was
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
guided down heading to the to the water
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
hitting a rock before he narrowly missed
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
rolling over and into the into the lake
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
but that location where he went off on
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
Bunker is precisely where my
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
grandchildren stand while they wait to
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
cross the road from the water in the
 
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.250 align:start position:0%
cross the road from the water in the
summertime

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
summertime
 
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.690 align:start position:0%
summertime
now

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
he was on a curve area coming through
 
00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:58.580 align:start position:0%
and and again the speed that one goes
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
has to be linked to the curves
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
because if you if you're in those curves
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
and you don't have visibility you're not
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
able to break in time and even though
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
the speed limit is 25 people exceed that
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
speed limit
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
we've also seen situations where members
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
of our family friends and neighbors have
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
had their safety compromised by drivers
 
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:24.860 align:start position:0%
traveling too fast to adjust their speed
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
when they come upon Walkers and Runners
 
00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:30.059 align:start position:0%
with narrow options because of those
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
soft shoulders steep embankments as that
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
young driver discovered and blind curves
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
the bill will allow the town to address
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
this kind of safety risk
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
growing vehicle and multi-purpose use on
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
the lake roads like ours warrants this
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
important tool for our town and for
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
others that have popular multi-purpose
 
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.549 align:start position:0%
others that have popular multi-purpose
usage

00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
and particularly where Road designs were
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
you know were established in the 1900s
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
and we it's otherwise not feasible for
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
us to take uh and put any kind of
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
changes to the direction of the road
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
because of the Cottages that are on the
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
other side
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh your vote will in our mind and our
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
personal experience save lives
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
it'll share the beauty of our special
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
areas on Pleasant Lake where people now
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
are hesitant to go down there for fear
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
that they they or their grandchildren
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
will have a problem similar to the one I
 
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
I expressed to you
 
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
I hope you respond to this growing
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
concern and allow the municipalities
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
like ours to make the right call on
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
roads that need seasonal speed
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
reductions local decisions have to be
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
made at that level
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
committee representative Sinclair
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you thank you in
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
Laconia when we've had problems you know
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
people complaining about speed the
 
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:04.460 align:start position:0%
police department has put up these boxes
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
that register the speed of all of
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles so they have that that
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
information yes has that been done in
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
your town I'm glad you asked that
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
question thank you for it in fact uh New
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
London has rotational placement of those
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
feedback signs uh in our case on our
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
situational requirement we wanted to
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
have those signs there permanently and
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
we raised the money in I'm sorry these
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
aren't signs these are boxes that are up
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
that that's right that's what I'm
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
discussing but it's not a sign it's a
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
box that gathers information yeah we
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
raised uh in our in our neighborhood for
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
this road we raised over seven thousand
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
dollars to to buy two of those uh
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
feedback I think they call them feedback
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
signs and
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and you know it wasn't that the town
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't paying attention to this they do
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
rotate those around and they are useful
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
but our desire was to have a permanent
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
set particularly in the Narrows area of
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
our of our road where they the greatest
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
risk is and those signs will be put in
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
place the dedicated signs uh this spring
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
and we hope to use the the speed limit
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
along the new speed adjustment at 20 in
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
conjunction with those new signs
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so you have no data
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
now that shows that what the what kind
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
of speed people are doing other than
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
we do the the town has placed those
 
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.350 align:start position:0%
we do the the town has placed those
signs

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
signs
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh periodically in the Narrows area so
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
we have you know we have the average
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
speeds and we have the uh upper upper
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
and the upper side variation is what
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
we're worried about it isn't that
 
00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:05.059 align:start position:0%
drivers themselves
 
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
try to beat that speed it is a situation
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
where you get into those curves and you
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
don't have enough stopping distance to
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
get to get to be safe there so perhaps
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
Kim can give you the data better than I
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
can but
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
but the um the beauty of those signs
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
those feedback signs is that they
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
capture that data
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
and for us that's one of the reasons why
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
we spent seven thousand neighbors spent
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
over seven thousand dollars to put two
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
of them in there
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
so that we can monitor when the that
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
variability occurs particularly at the
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
chair now like to recognize Doug Baxter
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill requesting five
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
minutes and also representing
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
representing New London residents
 
00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:05.389 align:start position:0%
representing New London residents
welcome

00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you all for this
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
um before I do speak just to address
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair's question New
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
London does have the Black Box
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of strapped onto a
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
telephone pole and does record the data
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
I do not have any of the results but it
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
was the old 80 20 rule 80 of the people
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
are following the speed limit more so
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
more or less it's at 20 percent that we
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
found was of the extremes
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I David addressed the bunker Road
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
situation I am a property owner on
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
Bunker Road and my family we're all
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
bikers and Walkers and we've had more
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
than one uh avoidance maneuver uh
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
because of the examples that David used
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
but I also wanted to speak to
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
um Elkins Road which is coming down into
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
the south end of the lake where our town
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
beach is
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
um our post office
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
um our boat launch and the town Dam
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
which is a popular hangout area and I'm
 
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
also the the coordinator for the lake
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
house for for our Lake and have spent a
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
fair amount of time at the boat launch
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
and get reports from our Lake host of
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
the number of near-misses we've had at
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
the boat launches unfortunately there's
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
not a long approach to the boat launch
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
so anyone launching a boat there is in
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
the middle of the road backing in or
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
pulling out and so we do have a
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous situation there and it's also
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
another example where we have a deep
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
grade coming down into it so it's just
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
gravity adds to the situation so
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
um I I my observations have been even
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
with our 25 mile per hour speed limits I
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
would guess and again this is just my
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
observation that people are going about
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
35 on average it's very easy to do I
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
find myself without paying attention you
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
can be going 35 before you know it so
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this from an awareness
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint that in addition to all the
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
other steps we've taken with pedestrian
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
well-marked pedestrian Crossings with
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
signage and markings in the road
 
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:09.419 align:start position:0%
just a different it's another tool as
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
someone had said in the toolbox that it
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
will create an awareness that
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
something's different here and I hope
 
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
that it would help slow people down to
 
00:33:20.169 --> 00:33:20.179 align:start position:0%
maybe the speed limit or close to it
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
I think we were all very guilty of
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
Leaning heavily on our Police Department
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
um to their their job to fix this I
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
realize now that I think Society has
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
expanded the envelope of what is
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
acceptable speeding I mean just driving
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
down 89 today I was going 71 and I was
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
the slowest car in the road I think but
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I speak in favor of this bill
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
because I think it was significantly
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
help our cause and other lakes and areas
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.930 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:05.779 align:start position:0%
Cheryl now like to recognize Kathleen
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
mulhaney hampson if I said it right from
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire D.O.T requesting two
 
00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:12.730 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire D.O.T requesting two
minutes

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:12.740 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
the committee Kathy Mulcahy hampson I am
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative liaison for the
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and the
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
senior hearings examiner
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
um I am not the guru of speed limits or
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
signage our Guru Mr Bill Lambert the
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Bureau of traffic
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
is unfortunately unable to attend today
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
he did work on the language on this bill
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
with representative Ebel it would allow
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
the municipalities authority to post
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
lower speed limits that they deem
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
necessary or reasonable we've seen it
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
usually in Lake areas where there's a
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
lot of pedestrians and bicyclists
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
wanting to access the area for that
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
summer season that's the issue that
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
we're aware of
 
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.650 align:start position:0%
we're aware of
um

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:20.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I have recently read that
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
the state has jurisdiction of 10 of the
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
roads in New Hampshire so there's an
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
awful lot of Municipal roads at that
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
that figured um really was surprising to
 
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.970 align:start position:0%
that figured um really was surprising to
me

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of Municipal
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
roads this bill would give authority to
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
um set the speed limit lower
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
um for a season
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
I've passed out a letter of explanation
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
from Bill Lambert who as I said can't be
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
here today to testify and answer your
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know how the chair
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
would like to handle questions I can
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
take the questions for Mr Lambert and
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
have them get back to you or communicate
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
directly with Mr Lambert whatever works
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
best for the committee members that
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
would probably work best to get to you
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
and you can get them to Mr Lambert
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
so any questions from the committee
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative value
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh we had a bill like
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
this last term and uh Mr Lambert
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
testified that
um

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
speed limits weren't dependent on the
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
quality and condition of the road rather
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
than speed limits and without constant
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement science are really not
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
effective do you recommend any like
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
friction devices or anything that would
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
anything like that that towns could use
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
to slow down traffic to create kind of a
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
psychological calming effect on drivers
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think they use those speed limit
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
feedback signs but I'll have Mr Lambert
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.250 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
does the dot or perhaps maybe someone
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
else can provide us if it exists any
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
actual crash data for these types of
 
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.950 align:start position:0%
actual crash data for these types of
circumstances

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah I'm not sure if that would
 
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:19.700 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
d-o-t-o-d-o-s would have those crash but
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
just to follow up follow up I'm I'm just
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
specifically about these types of
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances where uh seasonally
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's a heavier use of of the roads
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking for crashed out or every
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
single town on road that there might be
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions from the
 
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.130 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions from the
committee

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
um the question I had is uh relates to
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
um the state route numbers
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
and whether the town would have any
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
authority over those if they pass
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
through the town because that's probably
 
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:06.260 align:start position:0%
the main traffic route through a town
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
as compared to just a strictly
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
town-owned Road
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
there are municipal con compacts
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative and I don't know how that
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
would be impacted by this but usually
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
within a municipal compact along a state
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
highway the municipality controls that
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions from the
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
committee representative Sinclair thank
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
you and thank you
 
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.910 align:start position:0%
you and thank you
um

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
do you know of any highways that are
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
controlled by this state where they
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
actually do this during
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
for seasonal operation
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
I believe there are some areas where
 
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
based on Senator Styles bill that she
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
filed several years ago along New
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 1A and 1B from Northampton to
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
Ryan Newcastle
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
um I think there were some speed
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
adjustments made seasonally
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that I do not have anybody
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
else uh written down to testify so this
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
will end the testimony for HB 98 93
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
next bill we'll be looking at is HB
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
okay be it uh 1010 I'd like to open up
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB 55 relative to
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
driver education
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair would like to
 
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.970 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair would like to
recognize

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
Mike Moffett
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair great to be back in
 
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair great to be back in
transportation

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I'll see you this afternoon as well
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
so for the record uh I'm representative
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
Mike Moffett of Merrimack District for
 
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.690 align:start position:0%
Mike Moffett of Merrimack District for
the

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of Canterbury and
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
Loudoun so like most folks I once took a
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
driver red course I was 15 back in 1971
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
at droved in high school
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't remember paying
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
anything with my family paying anything
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
I just recall signing up for it
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
along with many other students and
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
having classes after school
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
and scheduling Road time with the
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
instructor to include some some City
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
Driving in the big city of Berlin which
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
was a big city back then
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
so our instructor is a Catholic nun
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
named sister Anita
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
we called it The Flying Nun
 
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
um sometimes sister Anita would place a
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
golf ball in a tee inside the driver red
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
car and if the ball fell off the tee
 
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
that met the driver was not driving
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
smoothly and safely
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
now I don't know what Groveton High
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
School pays sister Anita
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it wasn't much but everyone who
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to take driver would get to take
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
it basically basically for free
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
and my dad spent a lot of time with me
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
as well uh riding with me around the
 
00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:12.500 align:start position:0%
North Country in our
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
1966 red Rambler American
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
so I ended up getting 100 in the driver
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
at exam I got my license uh 1971 and
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
I've been driving for us over 50 years
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
um without even a speeding ticket knock
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
on wood kiss of death I know
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
so anyway HB 55 is a reprise of earlier
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
measures in this area seeking to allow
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
parents to teach their children how to
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
drive their youngsters had to drive and
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
part of the impetus here
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
involves the current High Cost of driver
 
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.250 align:start position:0%
involves the current High Cost of driver
education

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear more about that later
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
500 600 800 seems like a lot to some
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
folks especially is I didn't have to pay
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
sister a need or anything
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
and another issue involves weightless
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
and we hear that some waiting times last
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
six months eight months
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if somebody needs to wait almost a
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
year before they can get into a Drive
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
Away class that's a problem especially
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
if somebody's 16 17 if you've got to
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
wait six months to a year in some cases
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're just not taking driver red you
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
know waiting until they're 18.
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
so in knowing the driver education
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
yields better drivers it's a concern of
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks now you'll hear from
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
folks with experience in this area about
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
why this bill maybe isn't a good idea
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's been here before and that's to be
 
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.589 align:start position:0%
it's been here before and that's to be
expected

00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
expected
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh in in The Drive Red folks there are
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
good folks who care about driver
 
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.670 align:start position:0%
good folks who care about driver
education

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
now education is something I've devoted
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
much of my life to uh as a school board
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
I taught in public parochial military
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
schools College Community College
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
University I was on education committee
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
here for a couple of times so education
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
is part of my journey
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I have to harken back to the
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
scary testimony 20 years ago from the
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
education establishment opposing home
 
00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
education establishment opposing home
schooling

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
and it was a it was a battle as some of
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
you will remember to uh give
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling a chance
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
which we finally did
 
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
and uh the results have been very very
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
impressive I was seriously parents take
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
their education of their youngsters in
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
The Homeschool community
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
teaching parents have skin in the game
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they have every reason to want their
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
youngsters their kids to learn right and
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
to learn well the parents do
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I think many of us believe that
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
parents responsible for driver education
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
of their youngsters would go above and
 
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.690 align:start position:0%
of their youngsters would go above and
beyond

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.089 align:start position:0%
beyond
expectations

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
and again if we allow parents to teach
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
their youngsters uh physics chemistry
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
biology you name it why not driver
 
00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:14.690 align:start position:0%
biology you name it why not driver
education

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
and of course road tests and written
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
exams will still be part of the process
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
to ensure that anyone who gets a
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license meets the the state's
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
standards and expectations whether they
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
take a course from a school or from a at
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
school or driver at Academy or from
 
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
their folks
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
so you'll hear about safety concerns
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
later and those are fair concerns about
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
the importance of safe drivers of course
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
we all want safe drivers
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh but who could possibly more be more
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about the safety of drivers
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
than the parents of the of the young
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be driving
 
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.730 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be driving
uh

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
driver education statutes differ from
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
state to state Alabama Minnesota North
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
Dakota and others don't even require
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
State mandated driver education they
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
leave the curricular and the policies up
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
to the localities and to the parents
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
this apparently worked out well in those
 
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.790 align:start position:0%
this apparently worked out well in those
States

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang and I had a very nice
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
meeting last week with some DMV folks
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
and some driver-red professionals uh
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
last Friday and I think we all left
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
there wiser as to the differing
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
perspectives on driver education
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
and a fair observation was made at that
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
meeting we had that some parents may not
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
may not be great teachers they may not
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
be the best role models
 
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
if they were bad drivers themselves
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
maybe they wouldn't be good teachers I
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair observation
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
understand that concern so
 
00:48:47.819 --> 00:48:49.730 align:start position:0%
understand that concern so
um

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
I think that this
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
type of measure could be improved by
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
adding some guard rails so to speak
 
00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
adding some guard rails so to speak
um

00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
this is the committee's bill now it's a
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
so the guardrails I speak of if you want
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
to work this a little bit
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
is to address the concerns of parents
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
who may be suspect Drive red teachers
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
which I think there'd be very few
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh to Simply add language that
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
to be a teaching a home schooler so to
 
00:49:25.089 --> 00:49:25.099 align:start position:0%
speak for driver that you would need to
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
have a solid driving record I think that
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
would be an easy Amendment
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
in response to the meeting we had last
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
week with the driver red folks
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
so uh it's a good measure that hopefully
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
will safely move down the legislative
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
road to the Finish Line without too many
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
u-turns red lights or no passing Lanes
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
although hopefully the ought to pass
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
Lane is is one that this bill will find
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
so anyway thanks for your time and
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
attention and I know there's more
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh I come here today with two hats as
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
you read off uh I am the owner of
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
Precision Driving School in Littleton
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
and uh my history I served 24 years with
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
the state police here in New Hampshire
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
19 of those years I was in the
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
instructor for driving for this Troopers
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement around New Hampshire
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
I did that in the last six years on the
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
job I was I ran the program when I left
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
the state police in 2004 the next 12
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
years I taught Special Forces folks uh
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
driving and being in New Hampshire and
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
in Florida
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
and when I gave up that position I had
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
parents asking me if I would consider
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
teaching driver education which I did go
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
through the process and and then I'll
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
have my own School
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I stand here from Precision Driving
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
School and say I oppose this bill uh I
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
is you're going to hear many folks
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
behind me give you some more reasons but
 
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons representative
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
Moffitt brought was you know the parents
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
we can teach physics and all these other
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
courses at home but there is no other
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
course that they're going to teach that
 
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
can save their lives than driver
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
education so on the other side of this
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
coin I'm here for as the program
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the driver education
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
instructor program
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
I took that over a year and a half ago
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
as the program coordinator and since
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
that time we've changed the way we get
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
instructors through the program it used
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
to be our school in Keene State would
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
have courses in the fall or courses in
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
the spring but people would have to wait
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
and it happened to me as a driving
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
school owner I would hire someone in
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
April and I would say okay the courses
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
start in August and we'll get you in
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
well between April and August the
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
instructor would say yeah I found
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
something else to do I'm not not gonna
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
not gonna go through those courses so
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
now I have a week left to get someone
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
into that program which is not going to
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
happen so we had a real problem with
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
getting instructors through and I've
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
changed the way the process is there's
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
three courses that a a potential
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
instructor has to take to get into
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
driver education introduction to Traffic
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
Safety classroom methods and in-vehicle
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
methods those three courses are called
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
the provisional courses I've changed it
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
so it's not just once a year I've got
 
00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:53.540 align:start position:0%
those courses running year round
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
consecutively and I've removed all the
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
prerequisites so if a school owner wants
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
to hire someone tomorrow that student
 
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
can get into the next class whether it's
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
classroom methods in vehicle methods or
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
intro to Traffic Safety whatever the
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
next class is they can get in the owners
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
the school owners around the state are
 
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
able to hire in and and put new people
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
in much quicker than ever before and
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that I think I have 110
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
students in my classes right now some
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
are Vermont but majority are New
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students so I think it is like
 
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
160 driver education instructors now and
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm putting in I'm going to say
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
probably 70 or 80 more uh in you know in
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
three months time and it's a rotating
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
schedule so we have changed it it should
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
start making a difference out there on
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
the road as far as having enough
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
instructors to teach the class classes
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
of students and get them through faster
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
as well and hopefully reduce this
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
backlog that's been spoken of
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%

courses are 705 the third course is 8.55
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
because we have an in-person day that
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
they call a lab so that it brings it up
 
00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:24.500 align:start position:0%
to 100
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
150 more and so the 23 60 2265 I think
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
for those three courses
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
and what does it cost for driver's ed at
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
this point for students every every uh
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
group is different or every school sets
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
their own uh I am currently at 800 at my
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
school in Littleton and
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
um it's just recognition of the cost for
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
insurance and cars and start paying this
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
instructors so I can keep them
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's where I am right
 
00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's where I am right
now

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up sorry sorry and how
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
long does a person have to work for
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
another driver's ed uh to be
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient they have to get what's
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
called a standard certificate before
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
they can go out on their own they have
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
to get a standard certificate so
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
normally the progression is during the
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
next two years that an instructor is
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
working they're asked to take five
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
additional courses three one credit
 
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
courses one three credit course alcohol
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
and drugs and a two credit course for
 
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
another type of driving course called
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
Zone control it's a more intensive uh
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
way of teaching so they're asked to take
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
those other five courses before they're
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to apply for a standard
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
certificate to to be on their own they
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for my additional
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
question is it still possible for
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
um a student who perhaps couldn't afford
 
00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.099 align:start position:0%
the 800
 
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
um to wait the additional two years and
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
and take his driving exam without any
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
they can wait till they're 18 to take to
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
take driver education if they if they
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
wish to there are some things in the
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
works uh director marasco has been very
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
proactive and we're working on trying to
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
find ways to assist uh with tuition to
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
students who can't afford to get into a
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
program and we've been I'm part of a
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
driver task force that director marasco
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
has going and we we're working on trying
 
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you this
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
is for you Mr chair do we have anybody
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
that's going to speak from DMV or the
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
state police on this yes
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing on the further questions
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you for your
 
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.089 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you for your
time

00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
chair and I now like to recognize
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski welcome back to
 
00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.870 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski welcome back to
transportation

00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
who's requesting four minutes who
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:08.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
colleagues

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill House Bill 55 is word for
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
word the same exact bill as House Bill
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
1208 from last year which was tabled
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
which means I have a floor speech that I
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
never got to give
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
um outlining all the problems with this
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill but I will not go through it all
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I will touch on some of the
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
the bill does not specify what the
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
instruction would actually consist of
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
only that it is quote in person or
 
00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:37.789 align:start position:0%
only that it is quote in person or
online

00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
but I'd like you to compare that to the
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
driving schools that provide 30 hours of
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
classroom instruction with a defined and
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
approved curriculum from the Department
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
of Safety
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
the bill does specify 40 hours of behind
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
the wheel training however parents
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
already are required to spend 40 hours
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
with their teen behind the wheel
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
tracking these hours and stating which
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
skill was practiced and the bill really
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
has no other specifications outlining
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
the instruction
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 55 keeps only the tip of the
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
iceberg of our existing program but
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
removes a large portion for those teens
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
who would get their license with a
 
00:59:13.079 --> 00:59:13.970 align:start position:0%
who would get their license with a
waiver

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
they would not get the 10 hours in a
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
specially equipped vehicle driving with
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
a certified instructor as well as the
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
six additional hours observing other
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
students who are driving the benefit of
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
10 hours of dry direct instruction by a
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
professional who is up to date on safety
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
Technologies and best practices is clear
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
why are those observation hours so
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
important the more exposure you give a
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
teen to driving the more they learn it
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
allows students who see mistakes while
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
driving without being the nervous person
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel if something out of the
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
ordinary should happen on the road
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
because you can never recreate every
 
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
possible learning scenario more than one
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
student will be able to learn from that
 
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.220 align:start position:0%
experience it also helps a new driver
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
see that we all make mistakes and how to
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
learn from them
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's important that I'm clear that all
 
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
facets of the driver teen program are
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
vital and that includes parental
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
involvement parent instruction is
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
necessary and already incorporated into
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
the existing teen safety driver ed
 
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
program but removing the structured
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
structured classroom time with the
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
proven curriculum and 16 hours in a car
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
with a trained instructor is simply a
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
mistake and puts others on the road at
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
risk how do we know that
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
first we know that Nationwide vehicle
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
crashes Remain the leading cause of
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
death for teenagers and that's a fact
 
01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.589 align:start position:0%
death for teenagers and that's a fact
second

01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
last year we had for the very first time
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
real data in a study
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
done of a similar law in Texas
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
the Texas Transportation Institute
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
showed us that teens taught by someone
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
other than a professional instructor are
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
more likely to be convicted of driving
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
violations including speeding
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they're more likely to be involved
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
in serious crashes
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
the study also found that these
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
parent-taught drivers are nearly three
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
times more likely to be involved in a
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
fatal crash
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
and were involved in nearly 50 percent
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
more crashes in which at least one
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
person received a severe injury
 
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
this study was provided to house
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
Transportation committee by Mr Goodman
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
with AAA and I assume he would be able
 
01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
to supply the actual report to all of
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
you if not more updated information that
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
may have come up
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
since then
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
these accidents that are happening on
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
the roads are not just affecting a teen
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
driver in some kind of vacuum they're
 
01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:47.180 align:start position:0%
affecting others on the roads with
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
life-altering accidents
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
this cannot be a matter of parent choice
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
or parent knows best when the
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
instruction given affects each and every
 
01:01:59.770 --> 01:01:59.780 align:start position:0%
one of us every time we get in a vehicle
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
and I just want to hit on a few other
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
key points that I didn't have prepared
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
marks but the instructors
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
have strict standards for training
 
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
background checks driving record checks
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
continuing education and are up to date
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
on safety Technologies and best
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
practices compared to parents who
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
learned over 20 to 30 years ago I know
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
from taking driver's ed in 1986 to my
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
three children taking driver's ed from
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
2014 to 2020 the advances in safety
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
techniques and aggressive aggressive is
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
the wrong term but um
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
driving safely and and being you know
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
ready to react all of that has changed
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
second on the build new section
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
um I think it's five I can't read my
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
writing I have serious concerns with the
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
open-ended and questionable language
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
that is undefined the use of the term
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
responsible adult if a parent or
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
Guardian is not available I am very
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
interested to know what responsible
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
adult is and how that is um going to be
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
determined I also have problems with the
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
language that says the commissioner
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
shall waive driver's ed with no option
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to deny a waiver
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
third there are no details on what
 
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
provided for instruction either in
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
person or online actually means
 
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
um there is no control for the
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
Department to actually determine if the
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
instruction is meeting a certain minimum
 
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.670 align:start position:0%
instruction is meeting a certain minimum
standard

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
also I will wrap up with this I have
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
issues with the fact that the DMV says
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
in this fiscal note that a staff person
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
is going to need to be hired just to
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
deal with each and every one of these
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
waivers and I may suggest to the
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
committee that perhaps it would be more
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
beneficial to spend
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
um money and time to work with the DMV
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
on making schools more available and
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
more affordable and dealing with the
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
workforce issues to bring in driver's
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
instructors to solve the problem that
 
01:04:14.049 --> 01:04:14.059 align:start position:0%
many of our communities are facing
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
but I will leave it there and I
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
apologize but I've left my own committee
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
to kind of testify and I unfortunately
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
don't have time to take questions
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
can I email it to the clerk yes thank
 
01:04:31.799 --> 01:04:34.849 align:start position:0%
can I email it to the clerk yes thank
you

01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
can chairman like to recognize John
 
01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:37.970 align:start position:0%
can chairman like to recognize John
Cameron

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
Cameron
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire drivers education
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
Teachers Association
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%

01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
it's checked off support
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
I will change that Mr chairman my name
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
is Tom Price I have a card would it be
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%

great thank you uh thank you chairman
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
Gorski members of the committee uh for
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Tom prasall from
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
Demers and praisal and I'm here today
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire driver
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
education Teachers Association in
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and I'm here with
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh John Cameron who is the current
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire driver
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
education Teachers Association
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
before you know John kicks off his
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
testimony I just wanted to address a
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
couple items I understand the reason for
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
the bill and I want the committee to be
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
clear that the New Hampshire driver
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
education Teachers Association as well
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
as the DMV have been working uh over the
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
last several years to to address a
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
number of the issues that were were
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
raised several years ago we worked on a
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
rule change to change the age at which a
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
student can begin driver education it
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
prior to that it was they had to be and
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
John will probably correct me if I'm
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
mistaken but they had to be 16 years old
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of the course and we
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
modified the rules so that they can
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
begin the course when they are 15 years
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
and nine months and so that would have
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
opened up an additional class that the
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
student would be available to so we felt
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
that that was moving the ball in the
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
direction of creating more access to the
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
classes we've also a couple years ago we
 
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
were able to we worked with house in the
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
Senate to change the statute to allow
 
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
for up to 15 hours of the instruction
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
can be done via online or remote and we
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
have been working with the director on
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
determining what content could be done
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
in that manner
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
additionally recently we've been working
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office to create
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity for more driver education
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
teachers which
 
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
Mike Doucette had previously testified
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
to and I think that more driver out
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
instructors is the free market approach
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
to you know certainly drive down bring
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
competition drive down costs
 
01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.569 align:start position:0%
competition drive down costs
um

01:06:58.569 --> 01:06:58.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:02.299 align:start position:0%
and uh most recently uh two years ago
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
the national highway traffic safety
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
administration came in and uh did an
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
assessment of the New Hampshire driver
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
education program
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
um and moving to parentot was not one of
 
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
the recommendations I'd be happy to get
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
the committee a copy of that assessment
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
and additionally I do have a uh the
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
executive summary of the aforementioned
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
study that was done by Texas A M and the
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
transportation Institute with national
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
highway traffic safety administration
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
the full report is 216 pages so I saved
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
a couple trees and I can certainly email
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
that to the uh the committee with that
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to John for some
 
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.329 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to John for some
comments

01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%

in opposition of House Bill 55. I'm
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to try to Pare down what was my
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I was going to
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
read because other speakers have touched
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
on many of these points but just let me
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
go through a few the state of New
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has long placed a priority on
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
teen driver training has developed a
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
robust driver education training program
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
with the emphasis I was being on safety
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um driver Educators go through extensive
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
training as you've heard and testing for
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
their state certifications this combined
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
with a specially equipped car lesson
 
01:08:28.209 --> 01:08:28.219 align:start position:0%
plans and some infinite patients
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
provides a safe and knowledgeable
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
environment for a young teen to begin
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
the process of becoming a competent
 
01:08:33.179 --> 01:08:34.970 align:start position:0%

current standards for certified driver
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
education instructors including passing
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
as you heard eight college courses
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
specific to teaching driver education
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%

including an improved Curriculum lesson
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
plans route plans and more this bill in
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
effect potentially could make anyone who
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
has a driver's license a certified
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
driving instructor without meeting any
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
of these criteria
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
if this legislation were to pass I fear
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
that it would cause a number of driving
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
schools perhaps a significant number to
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
close leaving even more shortages of
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
professionals to provide traditional
 
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.309 align:start position:0%

01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
access to classes is an issue the
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
industry as you've heard is actively
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
trying to address Department of Safety
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
along with members of the New Hampshire
 
01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
driver Edge Teachers Association AAA and
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
other team members again are currently
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
meeting monthly with the director's
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
office to address these concerns New
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certified driving instructors
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
are the first line of defense in
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
promoting safety on our roadways for
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
everyone driving is the single most
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing we all do on a daily
 
01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.570 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing we all do on a daily
basis

01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
we all have licenses and each of us has
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
a different definition of what a good
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
driver is but I think we could all agree
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
that it's different out there than when
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
we learn to drive
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's more complicated than ever we have
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
more Vehicles than ever new technologies
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
and cars new roadway designs and safety
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
features and an ever increasing
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
population of drivers
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to taking class but that
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
cost is recoupable in the form of
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
discounts offered by insurance companies
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
for completing An approved driver
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
education course as driving instructors
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're held to standards that have and
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
have taken on significant costs our own
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
to become a pro approved schools
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
certified driving schools provide a
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
service to a small segment of our
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
population that service is as much about
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
the overall safety of our students and
 
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
the general population as it is about
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
the operation of a motor vehicle of
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
pushing pedals and turning Wheels
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
driving schools employ people who have
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
invested significant amount of money and
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
time within the state to be and remain a
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
certified instructor driving schools and
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
instructors are overseen by and work in
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
concert with the Department of Safety
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
for all these reasons we oppose House
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
Bill 55 and ask the committee to find
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
the bill in expedient to legislate we're
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions Mr
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
chairman if I can add one more just
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
brief comment one of the Hallmarks of
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire driver education
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
program is the concurrency model which
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
requires that when you are in the
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
classroom and you're learning about a
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
specific technique or skill such as you
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
know going around rotaries the
 
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
concurrency model requires that when you
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
be going to the car with the instructor
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what you practice and I
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
think one of the the main concerns with
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
this legislation in in the name of
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
safety is that as it was mentioned there
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
really aren't any guard rails up
 
01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:24.860 align:start position:0%
essentially somebody walks into the DMV
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
submits in writing and by saying
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
checking a box yes I completed the
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
driver education program and the
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
director or the commissioner shall Grant
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
the waiver I think that just creates a
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
lot of concern among the industry and uh
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons we opposed but
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
committee representative Coker thank you
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so as a driver instructor do
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
you you probably get a lot of children
 
01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
that have driven with their parents
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
first correct it varies from some that
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
have done none to some that have been
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
quite a bit is it pretty easy to pick up
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
the bad habits pretty quickly like yep
 
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.970 align:start position:0%
the bad habits pretty quickly like yep
yeah

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
teams will tend to drive you know like
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
their parents to start off with and I
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
think it's an eye-opener for parents too
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
when their teens take driver ed that the
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
teens go back to them and tell them hey
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mom hey Dad this is what we're learning
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
in driver's ed class and this is what
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know the the instructor had said is
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
the right way to do this and stuff so
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's an interesting uh experience
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
for everyone yeah thank you appreciate
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.610 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
so with all of the rules changes that
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
the association has looked for and
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
changes I'm surprised
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
and and I'm curious why uh the idea of
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
not eliminating the option for a a New
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teen at 18 to have to apply
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
for their license with no driver ed why
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been a um a challenge for
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
the association
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
currently at 18 years old you don't need
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
to take Driver's Ed right yeah you just
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
go in and
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
take the road test and
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
so I so I guess I misunderstood or
 
01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:12.140 align:start position:0%
misstated the question the question is
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the if driver ed was was
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
the vital skill
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
um that everyone should have why would
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
we not try to get rid of
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
um the option for someone at age 18 to
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
not have dry red and still go in and and
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
attempt to get their license without any
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
driver ed instruction well thank you for
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the question and representative if you'd
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
like to bring an amendment to replace
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
this with that I would be more than
 
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:43.940 align:start position:0%
happy to support that
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't been a discussion Point
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:58.669 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
sellers

01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
from 1618 they have to have a Driver's
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
Ed Course in order to drive once I turn
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
but you're saying that the I guess what
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is and I'm trying to ask the
 
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.370 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is and I'm trying to ask the
question

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
you don't trust any of the parents to
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
teach the kids how to drive I don't
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
understand why why the parents can't
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
teach them
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we would say that we
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't trust any parents to teach the
 
01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
student Side Drive because currently in
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
state and law they are required to do 40
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
hours with with the student that's
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
already existing statute so I think we
 
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.729 align:start position:0%
already existing statute so I think we
would

01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
say parents do have a responsibility to
 
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:45.260 align:start position:0%
be actively involved in driver education
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so you're saying if
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
we amend this law to mend this bill to
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
say parents if you give a 120 hours of
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
time and 30 hours a classroom that you'd
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
be okay with it
 
01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry maybe I don't understand the
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
question are you suggesting that I'm
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
saying parents teach the classroom as
 
01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.850 align:start position:0%
saying parents teach the classroom as
well

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
parents do all the training I'm saying
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
if we allow the parents more time
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
instead of just this bill is asking for
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
40 hours and then classroom training
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
right instruction if we amended this
 
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
bill to say they have to give 80 hours
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
or 120 hours plus some classroom trading
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
would you be okay at that point at any
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
point would you be okay with parents
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
teaching their kids how to drive I I
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
think the main concern with this
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is a classroom instruction
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
being done by a professional who's been
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
trained to provide it
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that we would be okay
 
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%

committee members
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm Tracy borvage you've seen me here
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
before I'm the president of New
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire motorcycle rights organization
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we do oppose this bill
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh about 20 years ago uh an hmro which
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
is our short term for New Hampshire
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rights organization
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
got legislation passed to include 45
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
minutes worth of motorcycle instruction
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
into the curriculum for driver's
 
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
into the curriculum for driver's
education

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
that's important to motorcyclists
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
because having first-time drivers on the
 
01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:39.620 align:start position:0%
road know how to ride in and around
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists what to do with us is very
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
important to us for motorcyclists
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
something else that I think you would
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
might find important we also got 45
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
minutes worth of the tractor-trailer
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
education input into the curriculum
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
because education is important to us as
 
01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.410 align:start position:0%
because education is important to us as
motorcyclists

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I think that's very
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
important and I'm going to go a little
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
bit off of my testimony because I've
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
heard some of the testimony I'd like to
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
bring up is I don't believe that parents
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
I'm a motorcyclist I'm also obviously a
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
car driver
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
I do not think that parents especially
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
ones that have never been on a
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
motorcycle are going to know how to talk
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
to their children and train them on how
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
to ride in and around motorcyclists
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh because if you've never done
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
training on that which we have done we
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
were invited and we have spoken a couple
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
of times and are continuing to do so and
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
work with the driver instructors that
 
01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:39.659 align:start position:0%
teach these classes and HMO has gone and
 
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
actually spoken to them we've talked to
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
them on the back page you'll see the
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
ride smart program that nhmro it's a
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
program that we came up with it's based
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
on information from data with fatalities
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
and crashes
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
we go and we speak to these driver
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
instructors that teach these kids about
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
what it means to ride in and around
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists how to do this how to do
 
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
it safely so that these Young Riders can
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
be safer riding in and around us
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if all of you have been
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
out in the roads but I'm sure you have
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
people are not writing very safe in and
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
around motorcyclists anymore
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
so we need to continue to teach our
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
children how to do that and nothing
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
against parents I'm a parent
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that I could teach my
 
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.850 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that I could teach my
child

01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
the best practices
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'm 59 years old I got my license at 14
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
and a half and then 15 in South Carolina
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
I believe I'm a good driver
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
I've never had crashes or a speeding
 
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.229 align:start position:0%
I've never had crashes or a speeding
ticket

01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that I'm the best
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
person to teach my child how to drive
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
I do believe that it's important that I
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
participate in that but I believe that
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
someone that's been trained on driving
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
around motorcycles and tractor trailers
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
is far more better at doing that and
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
taking those classes and and teaching my
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
son or my daughter how to do that with
 
01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.030 align:start position:0%
son or my daughter how to do that with
respect

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
to driving around other vehicles
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to bring up that we also
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
started the motorcycle riders education
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
fund nhmro did many many many years ago
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
the state now runs that and it's paid
 
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
for by motorcyclists we believe we're
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
big proponents in education we believe
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
in the safety of our roadways
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
and I just think it's important that you
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
you listen to all of this I'm someone
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's not from the Department of Safety
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
not from the DMV not from the
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
instructors we're writers
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
and we are out on the roads and we
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
believe in the safety and we believe in
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
the education that that safety brings
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
and when we teach in front of the
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
driver's instructors they're very
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
interactive with us they're asking
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
questions they want to know what the
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists need for us to teach them
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
so they can go back and teach these
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
youth so they can be safe around us
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to get all of that
 
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
out to parents there's no way
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
so I beg you to please listen
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is important

thank you
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.610 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
committee

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you for
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
I have two sets of cards from the DMV
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
and wondering if is the testimony going
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
to be different the same
 
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:30.649 align:start position:0%
to be different the same
uh

01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
it'll be different yes okay
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
so we'll start off with
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
um chair like to recognize Adam Cooper
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
John Durand and Dem Leonard from the DMV
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have any
 
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
looks like there's no position on the
 
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.350 align:start position:0%
looks like there's no position on the
bill

01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
good morning committee my name is Adam
 
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.950 align:start position:0%
good morning committee my name is Adam
Cooper

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
Cooper
 
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
my associates here John Duran Deb
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
Leonard we are all
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
licensing examiners for the State of New
 
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.990 align:start position:0%
licensing examiners for the State of New
Hampshire

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
we travel with your kids and your
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
grandchildren every single day
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we see a difference without
 
01:22:17.689 --> 01:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
hesitation between the folks that have
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
driver's education the folks that do not
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
have driver's education
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
I did a quick analysis over the weekend
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
I do a report each week called our close
 
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
calls and it is simply a report that my
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
instruct my examiners give to me
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is a close call anytime you have to
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
grab the steering wheel
 
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.410 align:start position:0%
grab the steering wheel
or

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
um intervene into a with a driver we
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
call that a close call
 
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
in the last three months I've had 124
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
close calls 86 of those close calls are
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
folks that are over 18 and have zero
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
Edge driver's education
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
so we do have folks that out there that
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
have education that are still dangerous
 
01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
but they get extra training and we take
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
care of them all
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you committee I just wanted if
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
you don't mind a lot of things have been
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
touch base
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
um with some of the things I'd gone over
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
but just thinking about what the senator
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
um like one thing with the teaching with
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
the Flying Nun I would assume the Flying
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
Nun had some sort of
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know background and how to teach
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
driver's ed so he did get that
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity where you were not going to
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
get that with parents I think some of
 
01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
our biggest fears is when you have the
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
parents teaching the parents are going
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
to teach their bad habits which we see
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
on the road
 
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
um many times when you get in the car
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
with these people you can right from the
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
gecko you can feel it as they're driving
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
the lack of experience the lack of time
 
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel it's hard enough with
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
the program we have now that
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we don't really you can
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
the parents are not always taking them
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
out for 40 hours they're just writing
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
that they do parents today unfortunately
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
work two jobs they're very busy you know
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm a very big uh very very poached
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:06.530 align:start position:0%
to this
um

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of close calls out there
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
and biggest thing bottom line is when
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
you get finished a test I want to feel
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
in my heart if I put this person on the
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
road are they gonna
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
hurt themselves hurt my family hurt your
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
family that's our biggest thing is
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
safety we really want to you know
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
emphasize that so thank you for your
 
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:34.430 align:start position:0%
emphasize that so thank you for your
time

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah sorry

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time my name is Deb
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
Leonard and I'm a licensed examiner down
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
in Dover and I've been there for eight
 
01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.709 align:start position:0%
in Dover and I've been there for eight
years

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
first and foremost it's safety I
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
have concerns over that bill
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak highly enough of the
 
01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:53.699 align:start position:0%
driver education classes that I work
 
01:24:53.699 --> 01:24:54.709 align:start position:0%
driver education classes that I work
with

01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
schools that I work with Excuse me of
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
teaching these kids how to drive
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
many times after each and every road
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
test I touch or have a contact with the
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
parents or the guardians or their
 
01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
support drivers and many times as I'm
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
going over the positive or negative
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
things that happened on that road test
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
the parents or Guardians themselves are
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
saying oh I didn't realize we needed to
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
Signal there I didn't realize we needed
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
to look over a shoulder there
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
and I did have a young applicant just
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago who was doing almost 18
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
miles an hour over the speed limit
 
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
and when we get back we talked about the
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
dangers and the safety issue and that
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
and the parents said well I apologize
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
but she's learned that from her dad her
 
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
dad is a really fast driver and that's
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
where she learned it from so that would
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
be my concern again I'm not saying that
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
all parents are like that or that would
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
be a concern but it's it's having that
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
education or that all this information
 
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
they need to
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
be able to teach these kids so
 
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative Coker
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
um so can you describe a little bit the
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
post if somebody fails their driving
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
test what is kind of the remedial
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
program after that look like or is it
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
kind of like just go back figure it out
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
and come back and perform or I can
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
answer for myself
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
I can answer for myself is that I take
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
that time in that vehicle with that
 
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
applicant I write out notes of
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
everything that they and their parents
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
or Guardians can work with and then I
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
automatically speak with that license
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
their support driver to make sure that
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
everything everything that's gone on on
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
that road test I have written out and
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
worked with them on do you have any like
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
oh sorry can I follow follow-up um do
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
you have any statistics on what the pass
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
rate is for the second time around I
 
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
mean do you see Improvement normally or
 
01:26:57.169 --> 01:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
huge huge okay because I've taken that
 
01:26:59.930 --> 01:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
time and I've worked with the parents or
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Guardians and the kids if I can
 
01:27:03.649 --> 01:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
build that rapport with them and try to
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
go over those safety issues of what I
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
saw that needs to be worked on
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of parents that come
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
back and say thank you so much you you
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
took that time with me I didn't realize
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
we needed to do all of this stuff okay
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate it
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you when you have those close
 
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
calls does that stop the test and
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're they they have to take it over
 
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.649 align:start position:0%
they're they they have to take it over
again

01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes we have the option to stop it at any
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
time if it's the dangerous situation and
 
01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:37.580 align:start position:0%
we will uh then take over and bring the
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
applicant back to the DMV
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we do have the option to stop
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
the test
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
um look depends on the infraction
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes I like to finish the test to
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
then see what else they may need work on
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
but we have the option to stop anytime
 
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Hill
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh the the concerns that you have
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
um as an inspectors or is that
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
could it be centered on classroom or
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um on driving or both or how where is
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
the where is the problem centered
 
01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
it's definitely both it's definitely
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
both they they really need that
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
classroom time
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
um to really get get like they were
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
saying earlier you you have a classroom
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
they go through say they go through just
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
for this we're going to work on rotaries
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
then the nice part about that is you'll
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
leave the classroom and then they'll be
 
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
working on rotaries in the vehicle with
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
the instructor it's just um
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's such a huge difference just in
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
a matter of how they handle the vehicle
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative sellers give us a chair
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
how do you handle
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
um Asylum Seekers
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that are getting licensed are immigrants
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
that are getting licenses that don't
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah um same thing it's because the law
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
is 18 so anybody over 18 doesn't need
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
the driver's education so they come in
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have a very high failure rate
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
there too part of it is a language issue
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
and and some of the signage is not
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
always the same sometimes they drive on
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
the left side from where they're from
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
and that so there is a high failure rate
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
then and then
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
um but same thing as um
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
as Miss Leonard said when you go through
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
the test with them
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
um you tell them where they need work we
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
have magazines we hand out we can teach
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
them on the with the magazine that you
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
need to do this this and this and and uh
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
usually you know
 
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes takes two three times but you
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
know they get it again biggest factors
 
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.699 --> 01:29:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr would you say that at
 
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
this point there any would you say the
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
worst would they be worse than
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
students at 16 years old being taught by
 
01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:08.870 align:start position:0%
students at 16 years old being taught by
parents

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
are they
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
worse drivers uh taking a test or not no
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
not well it depends I mean you get you
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
get people who come here and they're
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
very good drivers they're from you know
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
depends what where they come from and
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
and that I mean so many of them are very
 
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
good drivers and experience so you know
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
you can have somebody coming in their
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
30s and 40s and they've been driving for
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
quite a few years so they uh it's not
 
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue so I don't really have
 
01:30:34.450 --> 01:30:34.460 align:start position:0%
any numbers of you know which
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
particulars would would be but there are
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
many who do Drive well because they have
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
been driving for quite a bit it's more
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
the when you get back to the the people
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
who don't go to Driver's Ed and are from
 
01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:48.860 align:start position:0%
this country and at 18 they wait till 18
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
then it's a it's a little different
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the experience
 
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
like a person who came from another
 
01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
country that you know has been driving
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
but again you can get somebody from
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
another country and we don't we don't
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
know what their Driving Experience is
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
they may never have drove before you
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
know but it I don't know if you're
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
familiar they have three times to fail
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
then after that they have to go to
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
get driving instruction by a you know a
 
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
professional then they can come back and
 
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
professional then they can come back and
return

01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to your question um coming
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
from another country who automatically
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
seek driver education if it be it one
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
hour two hour three hour driving just so
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
they are prepared coming in because they
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of all the rules of the
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay nuts
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay we're falling behind go ahead
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair so if you're 18
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
years old and you fail the test three
 
01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
times then you're required to take
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
driver's ed
 
01:31:53.219 --> 01:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
driver's ed
it

01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll fill out a little fill out some
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork that shows the results of
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
those three tests that you have failed
 
01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
and then we'll present you a hearing and
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
at that hearing it's up to the DMV and
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
the state to decide how many additional
 
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
hours or education that that individual
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
may need generally on the first
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's 10 additional hours of
 
01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
drive time and five addition hours of
 
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
classroom and then if they have for some
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
bad reason they go another six three
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
tests then the education doubles
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
for the questions thank you thank you
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
thanks again for your time chair now
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
like to recognize John marasco and Mike
 
01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.790 align:start position:0%

Mercier
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire DMV who opposed
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee John marasco director of The
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles and driver
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
licensing supervisor Michael Mercier
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
will be very brief
 
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski through her
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
remarks highlighted all of those safety
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
concerns that we would have spoken about
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
um just for the committee we all are
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
working towards reducing wait times for
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
young people that want to get into
 
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
driver's ed we know that that's
 
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:10.940 align:start position:0%
something we we want to improve upon
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
lowering the cost for students that want
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
to take Driver's Ed and increasing the
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
number of schools and instructors
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to allow for um for
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
those things to take place I just want
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
to let you know that we do have a
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
monthly meeting with the driver's ed
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
Community we're actively working with
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
the community on rule changes we
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
actually had a conversation this morning
 
01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:33.860 align:start position:0%
we have some rule changes that will help
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
driver-red schools around the state and
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
those are with legal and we're still
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
having talks on getting those over the
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
Finish Line in the very short term
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
um and we're also working with the
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
governor's office on additional funding
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
that would be beneficial to
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
getting more driver instructors through
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
their certification process and into
 
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
these schools so the examiners here
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
they're doing this work each and every
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
day and they see the difference between
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
a young person who comes in that's
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
completed Driver's Ed versus somebody
 
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
that hasn't so with that I just wanted
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
to offer that to the committee and turn
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
it over to Mike
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
hi uh Mr chair members of the committee
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us here today
 
01:34:18.179 --> 01:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us here today
um

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate uh about some
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
of the examiners being a former law
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and also a former
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
Examiner I can tell you that I would
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
much rather be in a car with a 16 17
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
year old who's had driver's ed as
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
opposed to an 18 or above who has not
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
had driver's ed
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
the incidence of close calls that we
 
01:34:41.689 --> 01:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier are fairly high and
 
01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
people who are 18 years and older and
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
that's because they learn to drive with
 
01:34:46.729 --> 01:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
friends you know because they're a legal
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
age because they can join the military
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
you know we don't enforce the the
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
driver's ed rule on them but they also
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
go out they don't actually train with
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
their parents if they don't have them
 
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
available they may train with friends
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
people who don't really know all of the
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
rsas for for instance for driving
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
so the incidents are higher for them to
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
fail as opposed to the driver's
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
education students between 16 and 17.
 
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mike we're happy to take any
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you have
 
01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
have you attempted to
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
take information or data on drivers
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 16 and 21 who have
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
been in accidents so you can see if
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
they've actually taken drivers that are
 
01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
they've actually taken drivers that are
not

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so actually uh Mike has been
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
working for some time on um uh working
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
through one of our our contractors our
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
technology contractors to look at all
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
the numbers for
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
um at the very least passage rates at
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
the DMV
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
um for those that have Driver's Ed
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
versus those that don't
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
um we know that people that have
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
driver's ed fare better when they come
 
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
to the DMV for their exam as far as
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
crashes go I think what representative
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
telers both spoke to as far as what we
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
see Nationwide you know as far as
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
crashes among young people that's that's
 
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
that and you know data is there have we
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually drilled down and done that at
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
the DMV I'm not aware if we have not
 
01:36:20.209 --> 01:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 16 and 21. we
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at that study at all I
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
hope you do sometime thank you thank you
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
sir representative sellers
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr so the area I live in in we
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
have to drive 30 miles to go to a
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
driver's ed class and that's if we can
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
get it scheduled because it's a it's
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
literally almost a year out
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
and and you're saying you're changing
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
how the train driver ed teachers how are
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
you doing that and how much shorter will
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
it be I mean I heard that I'd have to go
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
work for somebody for two years before I
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
could actually work on my own on my by
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
myself as my own business
 
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question it really is
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
um those are the conversations that
 
01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
we're we're working through
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we do have the DMV rule set
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
that governs certain aspects of driver's
 
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:09.950 align:start position:0%
that governs certain aspects of driver's
ed

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
ed
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
um there are the those are some of the
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
changes that we're looking to make to
 
01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.629 align:start position:0%
changes that we're looking to make to
expedite

01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
expedite
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
um some of these processes to make it
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
more flexible for driver ed schools and
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
bringing more instructors on
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
um you know view online training uh is
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
something that has been discussed and
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
will continue to be discussed both the
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
RSA portion of it and the rule set I
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of opportunity here
 
01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
to drive down some of these areas that
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make gains on and I
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
think we have all the right people right
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
now at the table to include uh to
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
include the governor's office and again
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
that conversation that we had Friday
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
with representative Moffett and with
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang very productive I think we
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
all want the same thing so some of those
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
things that you're talking about sir we
 
01:37:58.090 --> 01:37:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh director for
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
coming and talking with us
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned driving down costs um
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
no pun intended but did um did you is
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
that with the answer that you just gave
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
is that where you're thinking the cost
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
savings are going to be and online or
 
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah I think there's
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh from a from a student standpoint
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different forces at
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
play there one of which would be
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
um if we're able to secure some funding
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
that would allow driver instructors to
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
actually go through the 15-week training
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
and do that free of charge that might
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
incentivize more people to actually want
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
to become instructors and um and that's
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
going to obviously open up more
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for young people to have
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
an instructor to work with and some of
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
those instructors will go on and
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
actually open their own schools down the
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
road so
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
um from a Marketplace standpoint that's
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
a good solution that being said we've
 
01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:00.260 align:start position:0%
all also to include last Friday had some
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
open-ended conversations about is there
 
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
any money available that could
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
potentially go into a fund that young
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
people could draw from that would
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
actually offset the cost of driver's ed
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
so you come at it from the drivers ed
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
instructor angle but also come at it
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
from uh you know a fund that might be
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
able to uh to offset some of the costs
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
for for young people so that just came
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
up on Friday as far as from a state
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
standpoint but but these are all ideas
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
that are being discussed right now and I
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
think that we do want to do our best to
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
try to drive down the cost for the end
 
01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
user as best we can I think there are
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
some ways to do it
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative sellers oh
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.219 align:start position:0%
um looking back at the history of why
 
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
states were compelled to create or
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
acquire Driver's Edge programs does that

give us any insight into what the
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
concerns would be going back to
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
um you know homeschooling of drivers
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
young drivers thank you representative
 
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
for that question it's a great one I do
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
know that we have Trooper first class uh
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
Rich DuPont from the state police he
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
actually oversees the driver's ed
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
program throughout the state on behalf
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the DMV he did submit a card I
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
believe to to testify he can speak a
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more than I can about the
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
historical perspective
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any other questions
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir and speaking of
 
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:31.620 align:start position:0%

he's asked for five minutes if you keep
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
up to two to three would be much
 
01:40:40.199 --> 01:40:47.270 align:start position:0%
up to two to three would be much
appreciated

01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%

okay

01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you

Trooper Rick Dupont I represent the
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
department of safety and I do oppose
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
um the Department of State safety takes
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
a position that um
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the past we would like to present
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
that in the past the state of New
 
01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.490 align:start position:0%
that in the past the state of New
Hampshire

01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
and the state legislature spoke to the
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
quality of our state's program when they
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
created it and what that program should
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
look like can be found in part in rsa's
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
263 19 in an RSA 21 p14 which speaks to
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
the development of the rules and the
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
rsas relating to driver's education
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
School courses schools in the
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
qualifications of their instructors
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
at that time the state legislature
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
together with the New Hampshire to
 
01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
driver's education Association who spoke
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
today in the Department of Education and
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Division of Motor
 
01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
Vehicles developed a quality program to
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
have certified instructors teach our
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
young drivers how to properly and safely
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
operate a motor vehicle upon the
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
roadways of New Hampshire
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
this program has been successful for
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
many years
 
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
it would stand a reason that most
 
01:42:12.669 --> 01:42:12.679 align:start position:0%
parents are not professional instructors
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're parents and are seemingly not
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
attempting to become professional
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
instructors and part of this house bill
 
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
however the process to become a
 
01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
professional instructor is important in
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
that the level of training they
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
initially received is college level
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
and the level they are expected to
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
maintain for their certification is
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
important like a teacher they have to
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
have professional development as well to
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
maintain their certification each school
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
and each instructor is held to a
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
standard above a normal person in the
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
driver education program they teach to
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
our young drivers is a quality program
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
that our state has benefited for many
 
01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
that our state has benefited for many
years

01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
a parent with good intentions cannot
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
replace a professional trained
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
instructor to teach how to keep our
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
roads safe and I really think that
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
should be the focus of this
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
um in 2021 our our program our state
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
went through a an assessment program
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
um we had these nationally certified
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
um people that came in they assessed our
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
program and thought that it was one of
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
the better programs in our country
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
so I think that stands a lot for the New
 
01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:21.770 align:start position:0%
so I think that stands a lot for the New
Hampshire

01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
at that time they were using the numbers
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
at three to five percent of our young
 
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:29.900 align:start position:0%
drivers were actually involved in fatal
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
accidents at the time which when you
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
consider how many the the number we have
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
now it's pretty low
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I attribute that a lot to his
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
driver's education
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
in our integrated format which is uh one
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
of the quality portions of the program
 
01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:47.219 align:start position:0%
and I know that they you know they spoke
 
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
about it earlier you learn it in the
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
classroom and then you go out and you
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
apply it on the roadway and it's done in
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
this some people use the term concurrent
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
the law the rule says integrated format
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
but that's super important to make sure
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
that our roadways and our young drivers
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety has a few concerns
 
01:44:11.169 --> 01:44:11.179 align:start position:0%
with the house bill
 
01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
regarding the implementation of the
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the concerns are the
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
age and driving experience of the
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
individual individuals sorry providing
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
the instruction
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
it could that age could vary it doesn't
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
mean that it's going to be a 30 year old
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
person that could be an 18 year old
 
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.709 align:start position:0%
person that could be an 18 year old
person

01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and who will be reviewing the driving
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
records and how will a parent receive
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
approval that was brought up earlier
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
um in the beginning testimony of how
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
would it that a per a parent or a
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
responsible driver could go through an
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
um then there was the the question of
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
the commission commissioner shell uh
 
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
waive requirements and instead of the
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
using the term May so how would that
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
approval process work I'm not really
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
sure and how would that waiver process
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
work again not really sure
 
01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.649 align:start position:0%
work again not really sure
um

01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
the documentation submitted uh by the
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents or responsible adults
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
does not require the submission of what
 
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
the curriculum was is it going to be in
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
keeping with the the program that is
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
actually in effect today and that our
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
driving schools are actually using
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
utilizing every single day to teach our
 
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
drivers in a consistent manner
 
01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:28.729 align:start position:0%
drivers in a consistent manner
um

01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
the does this this program go with the
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
current law of RSA 26319 which includes
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
all the 30 hours of classroom and behind
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
the wheel time the observation time 45
 
01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.830 align:start position:0%
the wheel time the observation time 45
minutes

01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
um of instruction of how to drive around
 
01:45:47.209 --> 01:45:47.219 align:start position:0%
a commercial motor vehicle or 45 minutes
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
of instruction on how to drive around
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
motorcycles that's a state law and how
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
do we make sure that this is all being
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
taken care of correctly
 
01:45:59.689 --> 01:45:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh the oversight the vetting of their
 
01:45:59.699 --> 01:46:00.770 align:start position:0%
uh the oversight the vetting of their
programs

01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
not really sure how that's going to be
 
01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.070 align:start position:0%
not really sure how that's going to be
addressed

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
this this house bill will result in
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
parents instructing
 
01:46:13.129 --> 01:46:13.139 align:start position:0%
um at various levels of Competency some
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
of whom may have never taken driver's
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
the laws and rules as they are at this
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
time allow for a quality driver
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
education program to be delivered
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
consistently to our young drivers by
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
trained and certified instructors
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately keeping our so our roadway
 
01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:36.050 align:start position:0%
ultimately keeping our so our roadway
safe

01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
any proposed changes to the position
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
from from should be from my position of
 
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
safety not convenience over safety
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
I've been a police officer for 18 years
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
and I have unfortunately had to respond
 
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:50.330 align:start position:0%
and I have unfortunately had to respond
to

01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
accident scenes I've had to see the
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
results of some fatalities
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
I've also
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
have been passed last year I was passed
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
am I fully my cruiser by 20 adults
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a fully my cruiser I've been
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
tailgated several times by parents or
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
potential parents
 
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm not so sure that I know that
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
some parents aren't they're going to
 
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
have the best of intentions but I would
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
caution that
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
parents are out on our roadways and
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
teaching their children bad habits in
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
our driving instructors are what's is
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
keeping our roadway safe and correcting
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
those bad habits thank you very much
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:47:32.699 --> 01:47:34.189 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
chair would you accept any bill or any
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill or any Bill like
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
this so a parent could actually teach
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
their child
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
I got the look
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
um ultimately at the end of the day
 
01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
we're open to discuss uh you know any
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
improvements to the house bill as it
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
sits but I think as you heard prior
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that our uh our thoughts still
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
align with having certified instructors
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
be the one that performed the the
 
01:48:08.219 --> 01:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
be the one that performed the the
instruction

01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking that question thank
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I'll go back to the question I asked
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
before is there any evidence in
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
in history of why you know States
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
started requiring driver's education
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
that would give us insight into what we
 
01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
would be seeing if we went back to a you
 
01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
know self-taught or homeschool type of
 
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.050 align:start position:0%
know self-taught or homeschool type of
program

01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.330 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
um that I'm not familiar with but I can
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
give you some insight into the
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
historical perspective very briefly on
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
the program and and kind of give you
 
01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.139 align:start position:0%
some indicators as to why we are where
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
we are so historically the Department of
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
Education was involved in concert with
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety and providing
 
01:48:54.729 --> 01:48:54.739 align:start position:0%
oversight to the driver education
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
program throughout the state and in
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
recent years the Department of Education
 
01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
has been removed from that and part of
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
that was funding that was that fell
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
under the driver training fund so
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
essentially when you buy a vanity plate
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
there's 40 fee that is attached to that
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
that goes into this driver training fund
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
that driver training fund over the
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
course of number of years provided a
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to the schools which then
 
01:49:22.729 --> 01:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
fell back onto the children and the
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
reason for that was when Department of
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
Education was involved in it the program
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
was required by the state at the high
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
school level so when you hear people
 
01:49:32.209 --> 01:49:32.219 align:start position:0%
speaking to taking their driver
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
education program through their high
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
schools it was required at that time by
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
the state date and accordingly the state
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursed 150 dollars per student that
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
went back to the school that helped
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
offset the price of driver education to
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
the students at that time now fast
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
forward to today where that has been
 
01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:51.659 align:start position:0%
removed and that reimbursement has been
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
removed as well and as you know with the
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
rising cost of fuels car and everything
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
insurance that falls upon now the driver
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
Educators you know they still have
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
absorbed a lot of that cost but
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know without that
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
reimbursement there we just don't have
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
that ability right now to to uh to
 
01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:09.179 align:start position:0%
offset that cost that's what I know as
 
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay last one representative Hill
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um quick question
 
01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:19.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um quick question
is

01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
um are any of the driving driver ed
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
classes available in anything other than
 
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.890 align:start position:0%
classes available in anything other than
English

01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:32.090 align:start position:0%
 
currently

01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
most of our school the majority of our
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
schools it's all in English I do know
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
that Nashua in the southern part of the
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
state does have a program and they're
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
starting to really gear towards having
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
it in Spanish but right now it's
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
predominantly in English but that has
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
been on my my radar for a while and I've
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually asked the driver's education
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
Community what languages do they do
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
their instructors speak so that if we do
 
01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:00.179 align:start position:0%
receive which we do receive the phone
 
01:51:00.179 --> 01:51:01.609 align:start position:0%
receive which we do receive the phone
calls

01:51:01.609 --> 01:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
calls
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um hey I speak French or I only speak
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
Spanish where can I go I can at least
 
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
send them in the direction of a school
 
01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
that actually has an instructor that can
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
we speak that language and try and help
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
that Community I know that there's uh
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
African communities right now are trying
 
01:51:16.199 --> 01:51:17.450 align:start position:0%
African communities right now are trying
to

01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.169 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
gain ground and traction and try and
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
start their own schools to help teach
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
um their young drivers driver's
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
education because some of them have
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
never been behind a wheel of a car in
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
the first place and now they're just
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
then you have the dialects on top of
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
that so we are working our offices
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
working with those organizations to try
 
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
and help facilitate driver's education
 
01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:42.659 align:start position:0%
in that direction
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not seeing any questions thank
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time
 
01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
I do not have any more pink cards so
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
this officially closed a hearing on HB
 
01:51:58.129 --> 01:51:58.139 align:start position:0%
55 our next bill will be HB 137 we'll
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
get it started in about two to three
 
01:52:00.060 --> 01:54:02.930 align:start position:0%
get it started in about two to three
minutes

01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:07.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
all right be at 11 23 we're falling a
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
little bit behind but uh let's start the
 
01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
on HP 137 at this point I'd like to
 
01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.669 align:start position:0%

and 137 is relative to boating safety
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
equipment rules and vessel numbering
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
rules and establishing a committee to
 
01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:34.340 align:start position:0%
study boat registration fees
 
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate your time this
 
01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.189 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate your time this
afternoon

01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:44.219 align:start position:0%
um HP 137 7 stems from an inner interim
 
01:54:48.189 --> 01:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
study bill last year HP one six four one
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh in essence the state of New Hampshire
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
is currently
 
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
um not abiding by federal regulations
 
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the way it collects and
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
distributes voter registration fees
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
the purpose of 137 is to establish and
 
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
solidify a committee that will look at
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
how to bring New Hampshire under Federal
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
Regulation and the interim study felt
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we weren't able to do that last
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
year and we needed until November of
 
01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
if this if we do not fall under Federal
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
Regulation then we lose Federal funding
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh the Coast Guard has said has given us
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
time to do this and believes that if we
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
establish this committee to move forward
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh that we can in fact
 
01:55:39.370 --> 01:55:39.380 align:start position:0%
um achieve the federal standard
 
01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:41.219 align:start position:0%
simultaneously we're working with
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen's office to change the
 
01:55:46.729 --> 01:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
law at the federal level there are seven
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
other states that are out of compliance
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
with these laws
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the issue stems from the distribution of
 
01:55:57.649 --> 01:55:57.659 align:start position:0%
the registration funds the funds
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
currently go to the Peace Commission the
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
fish and game department and the
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
department of Des
 
01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.169 align:start position:0%
department of Des
um

01:56:06.169 --> 01:56:06.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that is in contravention to federal
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
law and so what we're trying to do is
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
bring New Hampshire into compliance of
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
federal law on one hand on the other
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
hand we're trying to change the federal
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
law through Senator Shaheen so that we
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
come into compliance
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
um either way the state cannot afford to
 
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
lose the money associated with the
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
um with being out of compliance with
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
these laws so this bill essentially
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
brings New Hampshire up to date with
 
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
federal law and uh Captain dunlavy
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
um of the of the Marine Patrol uh is the
 
01:56:47.810 --> 01:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
one that's the honcho in this and has
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
been working with a wide variety of
 
01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
people to make this happen
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
so our subject to your questions that's
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh the introduction of this bill
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
01:57:01.129 --> 01:57:01.139 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
um how much are we uh getting from
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds and and what parts of the
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
lar are we out of compliance with uh
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I would defer to
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
Captain Dunleavy who has a specifics on
 
01:57:16.679 --> 01:57:19.189 align:start position:0%
Captain Dunleavy who has a specifics on
that

01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.169 --> 01:57:21.179 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
chair what are these federal funds used
 
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.290 align:start position:0%
chair what are these federal funds used
for

01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
so they they help support those three
 
01:57:27.119 --> 01:57:28.790 align:start position:0%
so they they help support those three
agencies

01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
um in their in their daily day functions
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
so the fishing game relies on them Des
 
01:57:37.490 --> 01:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
relies on them and the Peace Commission
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
also rely on those funds for day-to-day
 
01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:43.070 align:start position:0%
also rely on those funds for day-to-day
operations

01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes follow-up thank you chair
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
are there any strings attached to the do
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
these um
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
I guess divisions or departments do they
 
01:57:59.689 --> 01:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
have to do certain meet certain
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
obligations to have that money
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh not to my knowledge that that money
 
01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:07.340 align:start position:0%
comes in through the voter registration
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
goes back out for the intended purposes
 
01:58:15.410 --> 01:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
like I now like to recognize
 
01:58:26.930 --> 01:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Edgar
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill with concerns
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee for
 
01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:48.659 align:start position:0%
hearing me you say a few words
 
01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
for a minute and uh basically uh there
 
01:58:55.070 --> 01:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
obviously is a reason to have this bill
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
it was just explained uh just to have uh
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
some concerns uh in some of it's related
 
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
to the list of groups that are going to
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
be consulted by this uh five person
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
panel so
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
um again I represent Hampton I have some
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that basically that the
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
title or Seacoast will be you know
 
01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
legitimately represented on this
 
01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
committee and hopefully with the members
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
that are appointed it will be spread out
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
between let's say Inland and in title uh
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
groups and uh maybe even we could uh get
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
the senator that has both on here to to
 
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
enable that to be you know again to be
 
01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:38.629 align:start position:0%
enable that to be you know again to be
fair

01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:59:38.639 --> 01:59:39.229 align:start position:0%
fair
um

01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have uh some um some other groups and
 
01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be good to consider and
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we can just talk to the people who
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
are who are running this when it happens
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's not very many months to
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh to complete this study and as we know
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes during the summer it's like
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
August the Committees don't meet either
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
but I didn't realize that there already
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
was an interim study so hopefully
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
they're somewhat Along on this already
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
and that they they would be able to meet
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
with the groups all the groups both both
 
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
the title and Inland maybe have some
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
additions to the group that that that's
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
listed right here right now but it to me
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
it seems it's somewhat aggressive and I
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
I know it's going to be a Heavy Haul for
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for me
 
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you okay thank you
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
jira now like to recognize
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Rebecca McBee
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
who's representing Portsmouth who does
 
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
good morning it's nice to see you all it
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
really is I yeah I think the two years
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
in remote I don't know a lot of you so
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's nice to meet you
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I do support the bill and I applaud a
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton and others that
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
have worked on this issue in the past
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
the bill really has two parts the first
 
02:01:05.689 --> 02:01:05.699 align:start position:0%
part is the establishment of the study
 
02:01:07.370 --> 02:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee which would be for members of
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
the house and one Senate and I think our
 
02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
concerns my concerns with that is that
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
we do have appropriate representation of
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
both the inland waterways the freshwater
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
and the title being assault
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
and this the second part of the bill it
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
names the stakeholders which the five

businesses the New Hampshire Port
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%

which is why this uh this study
 
02:03:00.850 --> 02:03:00.860 align:start position:0%
committee is important to us because
 
02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:03.659 align:start position:0%

02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
we would ask that other groups on the
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
Seacoast area because up until now uh
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%

registrations and do registrations for
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
customers and also general public we
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
have concerns that the voters will have
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
limited potentials and also Rising costs
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
in potential registrations moving
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
forward he may choose the boat in other
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
places because of those costs
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh many families have choices what are
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%

to recreate New Hampshire in the
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
summertime and we look forward to
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
concerns that hindering existing
 
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
programs and also impacting
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
affordability will dramatically affect
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire in the voting so we

support
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
hb137 you've heard that the issue
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
um this the additional fees that are
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
collected currently when someone
 
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
registers their boat in New Hampshire
 
02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:00.060 align:start position:0%

02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
critical programs I'm here to talk to
 
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
you about one particular program
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
fees go to the lake restoration fund
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
through this Lake restoration fund a
 
02:07:13.729 --> 02:07:13.739 align:start position:0%
number of things happen but I'm going to
 
02:07:16.609 --> 02:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
speak on the support for aquatic
 
02:07:18.910 --> 02:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
invasive species prevention and control
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
so a great so New Hampshire Lakes we run
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
a Statewide a courtesy boat inspection
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
program you might have heard of it the
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
lake host program we over the past 20
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
years have met about 1.5 million voters
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
at about a hundred of the most busiest
 
02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
boat ramps in the state
 
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
and taught them how to take simple
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
actions to clean drain and dry their
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
boats to prevent the spread of unwanted
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
plants and animals you might have heard
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
of milfoil before obviously preventing
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
the spread of invasive species is is
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
good for the ecology but it's also good
 
02:07:53.629 --> 02:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
for for anyone who wants to use the
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
Lakes they invasive species are
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous they cause Recreation trouble
 
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:01.820 align:start position:0%
difficult to drive your boat
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
once you get an invasive species it's
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
very expensive to manage nearly
 
02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:09.659 align:start position:0%
impossible to get rid of and obviously
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
clean invasive free Lakes are really
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
important for our economy
 
02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
so this bit this program that we run is
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
supported by the grant through a grant
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
supported by these fees and we really
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
are asking for some time for the state
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to figure this out and
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
also possibly solutions to be figured
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
out on the federal level other states
 
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
that have split out to these costs
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they have seen large
 
02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
reductions in revenues coming in for
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
their invasive species management and we
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
just can't afford for that to happen
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh so I urge you to support this bill
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%

02:09:08.330 --> 02:09:08.340 align:start position:0%

02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
from Des and that Grant is just under
 
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollars every
 
02:09:14.209 --> 02:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
year and then we leverage an additional
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
nearly eight hundred thousand dollars in
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%

a quick minute to show up in support of
 
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
this bill I just learned this bill this
 
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
weekend actually uh when some colleagues
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
around and friends and colleagues around

Silver Lake and uh one of my
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
fellow members from Merrimack a
 
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor representative Healy told me
 
02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
about this bill and I think it's a great
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
idea and I applaud the sponsors for
 
02:13:12.169 --> 02:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
making it a short study committee with
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
the report due just this year in
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
November so it won't drag on I think
 
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea to study how the use
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
of these fees can be efficiently used
 
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I definitely support and I'd be
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
happy to serve on that study committee I
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently serve on resources and we have
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
an interest in this area as well and I
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
hope the transportation committee looks
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
favorably on this bill I'm a lifelong
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
boat owner both a power boater and
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
currently a sailboat owner there's a lot
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
of important issues addressed in this
 
02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:45.430 align:start position:0%
of important issues addressed in this
bill

02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
including how the Coast Guard fees are
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
currently used and how they might be
 
02:13:51.550 --> 02:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
used in the future
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
so really that's all I wanted to say I
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
know that the Silver Lake Association
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
supports the bill I'm not sure if they
 
02:13:58.970 --> 02:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
were already here apologies for my late
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
arrival and some of the other Lake
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
Associations so I hope you look
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
favorably on the bill and I'd be happy
 
02:14:09.649 --> 02:14:09.659 align:start position:0%

02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
who's in the back for moral support
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
I come to you this morning in support of
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and to provide provide you
 
02:15:26.689 --> 02:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
with a little background information
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Marine Patrol receives
 
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.7 million dollars
 
02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:31.910 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.7 million dollars
annually

02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
annually
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
that is part of the recreational boating
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
safety fund the national recreational
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
voting safety fund distributed by the
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
the receipt of those funds like many
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds is contingent upon
 
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
participation in various Federal
 
02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:46.850 align:start position:0%
participation in various Federal
programs

02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
and and one of those programs is the
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
national boat registration laws
 
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
during a recent desk audit of our
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
program the Coast Guard comes around to
 
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
each state every two years
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they discovered that at the time we
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
register boats in our state
 
02:16:09.649 --> 02:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
we are violating federal law
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
when we collect funds for
 
02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
the Des Lake restoration fund the fish
 
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
and game search and rescue fund the fish
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
and game Public Access fund and the peas
 
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
ports and harbors dredging fund
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
those funds for which we collect money
 
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
at the time of boat registrations are
 
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
not acceptable under federal statute
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the Coast Guard has identified that
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
and put us on notice that until we
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
correct that we are jeopardizing our
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
annual disbursement of the recreational
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
voting safety Monies
 
02:16:49.129 --> 02:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
so after working closely with the r d
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
committee last year in an interim study
 
02:16:54.049 --> 02:16:54.059 align:start position:0%
explaining to them the background and
 
02:16:55.969 --> 02:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
the issues related to the collection of
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
those funds we come before you today uh
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
asking for this study Commission
 
02:17:05.089 --> 02:17:05.099 align:start position:0%
it is to look at not where these funds
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
are being spent
 
02:17:09.290 --> 02:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
but how are we going to make up for the
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
collection of these funds that we are
 
02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
collecting illegally
 
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
through the boat registration process
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
that is the issue at hand and and beyond
 
02:17:21.889 --> 02:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
that if you get into the weeds uh it
 
02:17:24.889 --> 02:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
becomes a little more uh complicated
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
because there are multiple agencies
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
involved that receive these critical uh
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
funds for their programs
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
in addition this bill does ask for the
 
02:17:39.049 --> 02:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
authority uh in rule making for the
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety to recognize
 
02:17:41.399 --> 02:17:42.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety to recognize
current

02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
code of federal regulations as it
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
pertains to definitions
 
02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
pertains to definitions
um

02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
the industry boating industry like every
 
02:17:53.209 --> 02:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
industry right now technology is taking
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
off faster than what our lawmakers can
 
02:17:56.929 --> 02:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
keep up with
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
electric power for one is is is uh is on
 
02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:02.660 align:start position:0%
the verge in the Boating Market as well
 
02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
efoils I can go on down the list
 
02:18:07.549 --> 02:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
and currently in New Hampshire it is
 
02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
structured so that anytime there is a
 
02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
structured so that anytime there is a
new

02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh creation of a new vessel
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
new equipment changing equipment
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
requirements it needs to come before you
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
for those changes
 
02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
but in the automotive side of the house
 
02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle side of the house
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature has just authorized the
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner to recognize those changes
 
02:18:32.929 --> 02:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
that occur with the federal statutes for
 
02:18:34.610 --> 02:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
those specific areas
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so we're just asking for
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
essentially a housekeeping issue that'll
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
allow the state to keep up with the
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
terms and Trends in the industry by
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
recognizing Federal code
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
I've passed around a reference sheet
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
to you so that you can specifically look
 
02:18:53.929 --> 02:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
at those definitions and where in the
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
federal statutes they are so that you
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
can see it's only addressing definitions
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
of a personal watercraft so that we
 
02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
don't have our own or if oils they've
 
02:19:06.110 --> 02:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
changed the labels to life jackets
 
02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:07.129 align:start position:0%
changed the labels to life jackets
recently

02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:07.139 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh we're calling them type one two three
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
four and five they're now done by a
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
number assignment so it's those types of
 
02:19:16.129 --> 02:19:16.139 align:start position:0%
things that that are housekeeping in
 
02:19:17.810 --> 02:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
nature with this bill
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
and then the study committee as we've
 
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've said related specifically to the
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
collection of these revenues for our
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
partner agencies
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
as far as the membership or who you
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
solicit information from certainly we
 
02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
did recognize uh the ports and harbors
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
and his director or designee because of
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that dredging fund along with Fish and
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
Game Des
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to entertain any questions you
 
02:19:45.049 --> 02:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
may have at this time
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.710 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
questions

02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get the numbers right so I I
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say 1.75 million
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um that is federal funding that we we
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
received that would be jeopardized if we
 
02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
continue to collect boat fees and
 
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
distribute it the way we currently
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
distribute it is that correct yes sir
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's it likely would be a
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
percentage because the registration
 
02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:18.710 align:start position:0%
percentage because the registration
program

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we are required to
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
um engage in with the feds is only one
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
portion of that 1.7 million there's also
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
accident reporting that we we uh are
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
required to submit to the feds which
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
which we do annually so I I anticipate
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
if the feds would say New Hampshire
 
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
you haven't changed things we're taking
 
02:20:40.010 --> 02:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
away your money it would be a percentage
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
so um of the
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
of the money that we collect currently
 
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
for boat registrations how much how much
 
02:20:58.370 --> 02:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
is that that gets distributed amongst
 
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
all of those different those three or
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
four different organizations
 
02:21:05.090 --> 02:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
how much is how much in both fees are we
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
Distributing so
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and I know Des will correct me I'm
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
wrong I think it's 950 per vote that we
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
register goes to Des for the lake
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
restoration fund and you can use a rule
 
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
of thumb in New Hampshire recently if
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
you can't figure out a hundred thousand
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
boats a year registered in New Hampshire
 
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
that that's a fairly accurate number so
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
950 per boat
 
02:21:29.809 --> 02:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
one dollar per boat goes to the fishing
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
five dollars per boat
 
02:21:41.809 --> 02:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
goes to the fishing game Public Access
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
fund which is your ramp repairs and and
 
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh Construction
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
and two dollars per boat goes to the
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
dredging fund uh overseen uh by the
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
folks down at peas for the for the
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
coastal dredging
 
02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
um quick math at 17.50
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
and and so that's what we're talking
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
about is 17 I'm sorry follow-up sorry
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:08.690 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
um

02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
so that's 1750
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
would have to come from
 
02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
some other source in order to go into
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
those pools that you're talking about
 
02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
those different organizations
 
02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
or we lose a portion of that 1.75 is
 
02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
that and the total amount of money that
 
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
those 1750 that we
 
02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
we collect from all boat fees I'm I'm
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
looking over you you must have the
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
number there there's a the total amount
 
02:22:43.809 --> 02:22:43.819 align:start position:0%
of money other than the 1750 per boat
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
What's the total amount that we're
 
02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:48.050 align:start position:0%
What's the total amount that we're
Distributing

02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
Distributing
 
02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
you'd multiply that times the number of
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
votes we register each year and so it's
 
02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
approximately a hundred thousand
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand votes I think a year
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
correct give or take five or six
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
depending upon the year okay
 
02:23:01.849 --> 02:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
now I I will add one more thing in the
 
02:23:03.889 --> 02:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
defense of the folks from peas
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
the person who is boating on the
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
Seacoast must identify at the time of
 
02:23:09.410 --> 02:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
their registration that they are a
 
02:23:10.969 --> 02:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
Seacoast voter for that two dollars to
 
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
be collected and and unfortunately a lot
 
02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
of boaters don't do that and therefore
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh to say they're getting two hundred
 
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year is not the case
 
02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
so there are others those that's getting
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
into the weeds but those are some of the
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Finer Things that hopefully this study
 
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
commission will look at
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
last question last question is there
 
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
another committee that could do this
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know the answer to that
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
um maybe some of your peers might might
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
have an answer to that the issue at hand
 
02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
is where you have multiple agents one
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
one agency collecting multiple agencies
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
benefiting and now we're being told by
 
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
the Coast Guard those multiple agencies
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
can't be funded by that one boat
 
02:23:58.010 --> 02:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
registration process
 
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
some states are using a secondary decal
 
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:02.330 align:start position:0%
some states are using a secondary decal
program

02:24:02.330 --> 02:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:24:04.849 --> 02:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
where they have a decal you you have to
 
02:24:07.610 --> 02:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
purchase for 17.50 let's say and then
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
those funds are dispersed but it it's
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
now an Administration expense decal
 
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
expense another agency the voters
 
02:24:17.770 --> 02:24:17.780 align:start position:0%
getting hit for a second transaction
 
02:24:19.849 --> 02:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:24:22.370 --> 02:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
a dilemma
 
02:24:25.969 --> 02:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you so much thank
 
02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
you all for your questions
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
with that I have no other pink cards for
 
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm going to close to close the
 
02:24:39.730 --> 02:24:39.740 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 137
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh right now our next bill Herring is at
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
one o'clock so we'll take a lunch and
 
02:24:54.730 --> 02:24:54.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
carrying on hb22 they're required to use
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
seat belts during the operation of a
 
03:32:22.010 --> 03:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle in the chair light to call
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
up a representative recognize
 
03:32:25.130 --> 03:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative vayu
 
03:32:29.650 --> 03:32:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.660 --> 03:32:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
House Transportation committee for the
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Dan
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
vayu I represent Hillsboro 34 in Amherst
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce hb22 I am fully
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
aware that I'm not the first to
 
03:32:50.210 --> 03:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
introduce this type of Bill I'm also
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
well aware of the history of these bills
 
03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I completely understand that New
 
03:32:55.849 --> 03:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire values personal Liberty and
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the absence of a mandatory seat
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
belt law is a badge of honor and the
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die state
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
we also put a lot of value in personal
 
03:33:04.190 --> 03:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility where we accept the
 
03:33:06.170 --> 03:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
consequences of our actions
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
much of our philosophy of personal
 
03:33:09.290 --> 03:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
freedoms based on John Stuart Mill who
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
said that we should enact laws only in
 
03:33:14.090 --> 03:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
respect to those actions of each with
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
which concern the interest of other
 
03:33:15.479 --> 03:33:16.670 align:start position:0%
which concern the interest of other
people

03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:33:18.410 --> 03:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
but he also said that laws may be
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
justified to compel an individual to
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
bear his fair share in the common
 
03:33:21.239 --> 03:33:22.130 align:start position:0%
bear his fair share in the common
defense

03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
defense
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
or in any other joint work
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to the interests of society
 
03:33:28.969 --> 03:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
of which he enjoys the protection and
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
that a person may cause evil to others
 
03:33:32.210 --> 03:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
not only by his actions but by his
 
03:33:32.220 --> 03:33:33.170 align:start position:0%
not only by his actions but by his
inaction

03:33:33.170 --> 03:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
inaction
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that in either case he is justly
 
03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
accountable to them for injury
 
03:33:39.889 --> 03:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
failing to wear a seat belt only works
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
as an individual for individual freedom
 
03:33:44.269 --> 03:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
or victimless crime
 
03:33:46.190 --> 03:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
if it does not if it does no harm to
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
others and the individual Bears entirely
 
03:33:49.969 --> 03:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the consequences
 
03:33:53.450 --> 03:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
of their actions or in action
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
willful failure to properly use
 
03:33:56.450 --> 03:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
passenger restraints when they're
 
03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
available is not a victimless crime
 
03:34:01.610 --> 03:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
in the event of a crash any unsecured
 
03:34:03.950 --> 03:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
object including a human body can become
 
03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
a projectile causing injury to others in
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
03:34:08.570 --> 03:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
at 30 miles an hour an unrestrained
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
passenger weighing 150 pounds exerts the
 
03:34:13.729 --> 03:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
force of more than two tons 4 500 pounds
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
as it crashes against another object
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
including other passengers
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
when a passenger behind the driver is
 
03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
unrestrained the odds of a belt
 
03:34:24.050 --> 03:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
restrained driver sustaining a fatal
 
03:34:28.070 --> 03:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
injury was increased by 137 percent
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
when the passenger behind the driver was
 
03:34:31.729 --> 03:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
unbelted the likelihood of the driver
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
fatality due to an unrestrained rear
 
03:34:36.650 --> 03:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
left passenger increased further
 
03:34:40.010 --> 03:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
119 to 197 percent in the presence of an
 
03:34:42.410 --> 03:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
additional unrestrained passenger
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the middle of right seats
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
the risk to other vehicle occupants is
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
also significantly increased not just
 
03:34:51.170 --> 03:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
the driver
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
imagine you the damage you could do to a
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
child or another adult simply by Falling
 
03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
on them now imagine following on them at
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
30 miles an hour
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
who's going to be in that seat when you
 
03:35:02.929 --> 03:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
hit them is it going to be a grandchild
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
a child
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
a spouse
 
03:35:07.370 --> 03:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
what kind of damage you're going to do
 
03:35:09.050 --> 03:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
when you hit them
 
03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
unrestrained occupants are also 30 times
 
03:35:12.769 --> 03:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
more likely to be ejected from the
 
03:35:12.779 --> 03:35:13.910 align:start position:0%
more likely to be ejected from the
vehicle

03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:35:15.650 --> 03:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
one percent of restrained occupants are
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
ejected compared to almost a third of
 
03:35:19.490 --> 03:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
unrestrained documents
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
once ejected almost 80 percent
 
03:35:25.010 --> 03:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
die as a result
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's also a likelihood that a person
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
ejected from a vehicle will land on the
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
roadway where they'll become just
 
03:35:31.790 --> 03:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
another piece of road debris
 
03:35:33.410 --> 03:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
that other drivers will attempt to avoid
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
often unsuccessfully possibly causing a
 
03:35:39.170 --> 03:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
secondary crash and more damage injuries
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
or fatalities
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
one person neglecting to wear a seat
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
belt increases the likelihood that
 
03:35:47.090 --> 03:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
others in the vehicle will neglect to
 
03:35:49.010 --> 03:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
wear theirs as well putting everyone at
 
03:35:49.020 --> 03:35:52.849 align:start position:0%
wear theirs as well putting everyone at
risk

03:35:52.849 --> 03:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
if we assume that the unrestrained
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle occupants accept full
 
03:35:58.010 --> 03:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the consequences
 
03:35:59.389 --> 03:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
then we must assume that they will bear
 
03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
the burden of the medical expenses for
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the injuries
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
they cause they will bear the cost of
 
03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
supporting the families of those killed
 
03:36:08.690 --> 03:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
or permanently disabled
 
03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
their surviving families will bear the
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
burden of Long-Term Care Nursing Care
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
and nursing care for those who survive
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
but whose injuries render them unable to
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
care for themselves
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
we talk about debt but we don't always
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
talk about the injuries
 
03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
you're far more likely to be injured
 
03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
often seriously
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
and often with permanent lifelong
 
03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities or pain
 
03:36:34.969 --> 03:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
you must also assume that they will
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
reimburse the First Responders and
 
03:36:38.330 --> 03:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
medical personnel of whom they enjoyed
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
and expect the protection
 
03:36:42.110 --> 03:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
who will be charged with making every
 
03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
effort to save their life
 
03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
heal their injuries or clean up their
 
03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
heal their injuries or clean up their
remains

03:36:48.050 --> 03:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
remains
 
03:36:49.490 --> 03:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
we often talk about having clear
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that something is effective
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
before acting
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
seat belts work there is no statistical
 
03:36:55.680 --> 03:36:57.349 align:start position:0%
seat belts work there is no statistical
twist

03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
twist
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
I offer one statistic that should be
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
persuasive to everyone
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
the national usage rate for seat belts
 
03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
is 90.4 percent
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
but 50 of deaths are to those who are
 
03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:14.510 align:start position:0%
but 50 of deaths are to those who are
unrestrained

03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
unrestrained
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
so of the 9.6 percent of people who
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
drive without seat belts
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
they account for almost half or over
 
03:37:22.910 --> 03:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
half of the deaths in this country not
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
not including the injuries that go along
 
03:37:28.370 --> 03:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the usage rate is only
 
03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
about 75 percent and it's been creeping
 
03:37:32.040 --> 03:37:32.990 align:start position:0%
about 75 percent and it's been creeping
up

03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:37:35.450 --> 03:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
only recently
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
imagine how many deaths
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
account come along with that extra 15 we
 
03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
had just been up to the national average
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
as Dan Goodman AAA pointed on prior
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
testimony usage is depending on a
 
03:37:49.030 --> 03:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool of Education
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
engineering and enforcement
 
03:37:53.210 --> 03:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
auto manufacturers have done their part
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
in engineering safer vehicles
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
by making seat belts more comfortable
 
03:37:57.889 --> 03:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
and less restrictive installing
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
persistent reminder Chimes that never
 
03:38:00.410 --> 03:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
time out
 
03:38:02.929 --> 03:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
designing safer passenger compartments
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
and even going so far as to design dual
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
stage airbags to account for the impact
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
of unrestrained passengers occupants
 
03:38:11.210 --> 03:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety spends a
 
03:38:13.130 --> 03:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
lot of time and money on education
 
03:38:15.650 --> 03:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
they purchase ads and sponsor events but
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
research has shown that marketing
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
I sent you all a paper by Paul slope Dr
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
Paul slovick one of the top researchers
 
03:38:24.349 --> 03:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
on risk perception and decision making
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
if you've read a book on leadership or
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
decision making you probably heard his
 
03:38:30.769 --> 03:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
name referenced
 
03:38:32.330 --> 03:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
he's internationally known and very
 
03:38:34.190 --> 03:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
renowned in his profession
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
with all the marketing skills of
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
professional advertisers and the
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
knowledge and skill of renowned Scholars
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
the most creative and scientifically
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
designed marketing campaigns weren't
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
successful in persuading people to wear
 
03:38:45.889 --> 03:38:45.899 align:start position:0%
seat belts which led directly in the
 
03:38:47.809 --> 03:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
1980s the implementation of mandatory
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
seatbelt laws literally everywhere in
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
the country
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
the burden of convincing people to use
 
03:38:58.370 --> 03:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
seat belts lies on with law enforcement
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
they're forced to do marketing campaigns
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
if they know what are ineffective they
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
cajole they plead and it's simply
 
03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
scientifically unrealistic to expect
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
them to make the kind of progress we
 
03:39:10.250 --> 03:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
need to make
 
03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
and 40 Years of effort New Hampshire has
 
03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
only recently achieved 75 usage rate
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
when much of the country is already over
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
90 percent and has been there for quite
 
03:39:18.349 --> 03:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
some time
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is costing lives
 
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
this bill provides the Third Leg of the
 
03:39:24.170 --> 03:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
stool by providing a very limited
 
03:39:26.269 --> 03:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism it's a secondary
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
law which means you can't be pulled over
 
03:39:30.650 --> 03:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
simply for not wearing a seat belt it
 
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.330 --> 03:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's likely that New Hampshire's
 
03:39:37.370 --> 03:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
progress increasing seat belt usage is
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
more a factor of enforcement efforts in
 
03:39:41.150 --> 03:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
the other 49 states
 
03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:42.779 align:start position:0%
the message that we send by not having a
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
law is that it's okay to not wear a
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
seatbelt in New Hampshire
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm certain there are people who come
 
03:39:48.710 --> 03:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
into the state in the immediately click
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
the release on their seat belt as soon
 
03:39:52.010 --> 03:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
as they hit the state line
 
03:39:54.170 --> 03:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
putting themselves and others at risk
 
03:39:56.809 --> 03:39:56.819 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't get to everyone we
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
can't get everyone to obey the law
 
03:40:01.250 --> 03:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
especially if they disagree with it
 
03:40:02.809 --> 03:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
but at least we can send a consistent
 
03:40:05.330 --> 03:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
message the seat belts work and we would
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony my
 
03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:12.830 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony my
introduction

03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
03:40:14.929 --> 03:40:14.939 align:start position:0%
be glad to understand any questions
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:40:16.439 --> 03:40:18.469 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:40:23.090 --> 03:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and your
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
time about the marketing program I know
 
03:40:29.450 --> 03:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
at past debates in this issue I've been
 
03:40:31.610 --> 03:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
here 13 years and we've heard similar
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
bills for Florence
 
03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:33.710 align:start position:0%
bills for Florence
um

03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
and but um which does not say this one
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
isn't timely but um oh we should do the
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
marketing are those it's a marketing
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
campaign and strength and passing this
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
law are those in any way inconsistent or
 
03:40:48.290 --> 03:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive or could we do both
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
at the same time I think it's important
 
03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
to do both at the same time
 
03:40:52.500 --> 03:40:53.570 align:start position:0%
to do both at the same time
um

03:40:53.570 --> 03:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:53.580 --> 03:40:55.070 align:start position:0%
um
enforcement

03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
any of the three legs alone won't be
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
completely effective I think you have to
 
03:41:00.429 --> 03:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
have an enforcement mechanism to
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.809 --> 03:41:07.819 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:41:11.279 --> 03:41:12.170 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious about
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
um why you on on page uh two I guess
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
um line
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
19 why you left in the uh the person
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
that is a passenger in a motor vehicle
 
03:41:30.530 --> 03:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
for hire
 
03:41:30.540 --> 03:41:31.910 align:start position:0%
for hire
um

03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
if you believe that uh having someone
 
03:41:36.969 --> 03:41:36.979 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back seat
 
03:41:40.190 --> 03:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
can become the missile why why would you
 
03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
leave that there and and have them
 
03:41:43.969 --> 03:41:43.979 align:start position:0%
become that missile
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
in putting this together I researched a
 
03:41:47.090 --> 03:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
lot of other state laws and that was a
 
03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
consistent element in almost all of them
 
03:41:50.929 --> 03:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
and I think it's because the
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility would then fall on the
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
the company that owns the vehicle to try
 
03:41:59.330 --> 03:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
to persuade people and
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that it would be difficult to
 
03:42:05.090 --> 03:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
enforce that on people I don't think
 
03:42:07.190 --> 03:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's a statement that it's a wrong thing
 
03:42:09.170 --> 03:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
to do but I think it's just a
 
03:42:12.170 --> 03:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
recognition that an Uber driver or a
 
03:42:13.729 --> 03:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
taxi driver is not going to always be
 
03:42:15.530 --> 03:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
persuasive if people don't want to
 
03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
buckle up and they shouldn't be
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
penalized for it
 
03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm also curious why you believe that
 
03:42:28.010 --> 03:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
people that cross the border into New
 
03:42:28.020 --> 03:42:29.570 align:start position:0%
people that cross the border into New
Hampshire

03:42:29.570 --> 03:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:42:29.580 --> 03:42:30.889 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um immediately

03:42:30.889 --> 03:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
um immediately
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
disconnect their seatbelt
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's based on conversations that I've
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
had with State Police officials
 
03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:39.010 align:start position:0%
had with State Police officials
um

03:42:39.010 --> 03:42:39.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
also posts that I've seen in tourist
 
03:42:44.269 --> 03:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
sites on Facebook people saying New
 
03:42:46.190 --> 03:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it right I was able to
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
drive in and took off my seat belt and
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
it was such a relief to be in a state
 
03:42:51.650 --> 03:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
that has this kind of freedom to me
 
03:42:51.660 --> 03:42:52.610 align:start position:0%
that has this kind of freedom to me
that's

03:42:52.610 --> 03:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know kind of
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
the wrong message we want to send and
 
03:42:58.190 --> 03:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I said that in my my
 
03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:01.250 align:start position:0%
that's why I said that in my my
presentation

03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr chair so you're saying
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
freedom is the wrong message we want to
 
03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:09.050 align:start position:0%
freedom is the wrong message we want to
send

03:43:09.050 --> 03:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
send
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
no we want to have freedom but we want
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
to make people accountable for their
 
03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
decisions and accountable for their
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
ideas and we want to send a consistent
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
message that we we hold people
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
accountable for their
 
03:43:22.610 --> 03:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
for things that that have effects on
 
03:43:25.490 --> 03:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
others that your right to Freedom ends
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
at the tip of my nose
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
and that you not wearing a sequel is not
 
03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
a reckless crime that it does affect
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
others and it is consequential and we
 
03:43:35.929 --> 03:43:35.939 align:start position:0%
should have an interest in enforcing
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of a
 
03:43:37.319 --> 03:43:40.510 align:start position:0%
that kind of a
policy

03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.729 --> 03:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:43:45.650 --> 03:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you and if you give
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
a chance if you can fill the pink card
 
03:43:49.389 --> 03:43:49.399 align:start position:0%
for me I'd appreciate it
 
03:43:52.210 --> 03:43:52.220 align:start position:0%
chair now like to recognize
 
03:43:55.610 --> 03:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Suzanne Vale
 
03:43:58.450 --> 03:43:58.460 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chair
 
03:44:15.070 --> 03:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
03:44:17.570 --> 03:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
transportation committee
 
03:44:17.580 --> 03:44:18.349 align:start position:0%
transportation committee
um

03:44:18.349 --> 03:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm a former member of this committee
 
03:44:22.610 --> 03:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
and a former co-sponsor of this bill and
 
03:44:28.490 --> 03:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor once again today
 
03:44:31.690 --> 03:44:31.700 align:start position:0%
um so I find myself here before you to
 
03:44:34.849 --> 03:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I've said in the past and
 
03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
that I find that when you prepare
 
03:44:39.769 --> 03:44:39.779 align:start position:0%
yourself and your child for travel by
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
wearing your own seat belt and by
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
wearing by using appropriate restraints
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
in your vehicle you have the best chance
 
03:44:49.130 --> 03:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
of survival on New Hampshire highways in
 
03:44:49.140 --> 03:44:50.990 align:start position:0%
of survival on New Hampshire highways in
2023

03:44:50.990 --> 03:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
2023
 
03:44:53.210 --> 03:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
today you'll hear countless statistics
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
that show that seat belts save lives
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
they save quality of life and they
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
reduce trauma to individuals involved in
 
03:45:03.650 --> 03:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
an accident the degree of human
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
suffering can be sharply reduced and
 
03:45:08.809 --> 03:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's why we are asking people to wear
 
03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
these seat belts my concerns and my
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
support from the bill comes from my
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
recognition that our personal choices
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
affect more than just our own personal
 
03:45:22.370 --> 03:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
lives they affect law enforcement and
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
all emergency responders that arrive out
 
03:45:27.290 --> 03:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
of motor vehicle accident
 
03:45:29.570 --> 03:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
responders in New Hampshire must face
 
03:45:32.570 --> 03:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
exacerbated and extended consequences of
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
their time on the road responding
 
03:45:37.190 --> 03:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
responding to motor vehicle casualties
 
03:45:39.050 --> 03:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
and we're not just talking about
 
03:45:41.570 --> 03:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
statistics we're talking about we're not
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
just talking about cost and we're really
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
not talking about any one aspect of what
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
happens when people don't wear a
 
03:45:49.969 --> 03:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
seatbelt and they're involved in a motor
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.210 --> 03:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
what is an overwhelming amount of
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that we need to protect
 
03:45:59.809 --> 03:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
citizens by making seat belt use
 
03:46:02.090 --> 03:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
mandatory has not been persuasive in the
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
past but it should be today with the
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
exception supplied in the bill to use
 
03:46:08.570 --> 03:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
safety equipment that's already in your
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
car and must be in working condition in
 
03:46:13.130 --> 03:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
order for it to pass inspection
 
03:46:15.530 --> 03:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
with that I will conclude my testimony
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
however brief it might be I just want to
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
get the point across that the human
 
03:46:21.889 --> 03:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
suffering that's caused by not wearing
 
03:46:23.389 --> 03:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
seat belts
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
may be a cost that we cannot really
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
recognize as a true cost but it really
 
03:46:31.729 --> 03:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
does have a dollar value and this is a
 
03:46:33.889 --> 03:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
really important bill to get our state
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
in line with other states where safety
 
03:46:38.450 --> 03:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
is a priority thank you so much and I'll
 
03:46:40.610 --> 03:46:40.620 align:start position:0%

03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
um our mission at the office of Highway
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
Safety is to reduce crashes and to
 
03:47:59.809 --> 03:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
eliminate fatalities we do this through
 
03:48:01.550 --> 03:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
a variety of ways to include funding
 
03:48:03.610 --> 03:48:03.620 align:start position:0%
educational and enforcement activities
 
03:48:07.250 --> 03:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
all designed with this mission in mind
 
03:48:09.170 --> 03:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety sees this
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
pending legislation at the top of our
 
03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
list the priorities to help accomplish
 
03:48:13.790 --> 03:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
our goal
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I am proud to represent our office
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
before this committee
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
my testimony will revolve around facts
 
03:48:23.150 --> 03:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
data and personal experiences as a
 
03:48:24.830 --> 03:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
31-year trooper regarding seat belt
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
usage in New Hampshire in the hopes of
 
03:48:28.250 --> 03:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
assisting this committee and hopefully
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the decision making
 
03:48:32.450 --> 03:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is a fact New Hampshire is the only
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
state in the nation
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
without a mandatory seat belt law for
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
people over the age of 18.
 
03:48:43.010 --> 03:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
what I have come to learn in my two
 
03:48:45.050 --> 03:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
years in the office of Highway Safety is
 
03:48:46.849 --> 03:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
that there is a belief amongst many
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we can accomplish the voluntary use
 
03:48:52.849 --> 03:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
of seat belts through education and
 
03:48:52.859 --> 03:48:54.290 align:start position:0%
of seat belts through education and
Outreach

03:48:54.290 --> 03:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
Outreach
 
03:48:56.809 --> 03:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
data suggests that that belief is
 
03:48:56.819 --> 03:48:58.969 align:start position:0%
data suggests that that belief is
inaccurate

03:48:58.969 --> 03:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
the national highway traffic safety
 
03:49:03.170 --> 03:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
administration funds visual seat belt
 
03:49:06.170 --> 03:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
use surveys in all 50 states on a yearly
 
03:49:06.180 --> 03:49:07.309 align:start position:0%
use surveys in all 50 states on a yearly
basis

03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:49:11.090 --> 03:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
the study done in 2021 shows 27 states
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
have seatbelt use rates above 90 percent
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
44 states are above 80 percent
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the 50 states in the nation New
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is dead last at 75.5
 
03:49:28.250 --> 03:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
one in four individuals observed driving
 
03:49:29.929 --> 03:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
on the roads of New Hampshire do so
 
03:49:29.939 --> 03:49:32.450 align:start position:0%
on the roads of New Hampshire do so
unrestrained

03:49:32.450 --> 03:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
unrestrained
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
to put that into perspective
 
03:49:36.170 --> 03:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
think of this fact in the following
 
03:49:38.809 --> 03:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
terms the next time the entire New
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives
 
03:49:42.590 --> 03:49:42.600 align:start position:0%

03:49:45.170 --> 03:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
all 400 or so strong
 
03:49:47.929 --> 03:49:47.939 align:start position:0%
look around the room and consider that
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
100 of your colleagues will drive
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
unrestrained when they head home that
 
03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:54.410 align:start position:0%
unrestrained when they head home that
day

03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.050 --> 03:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
there is also a belief but that those
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
who choose not to utilize the seat belt
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
commit a victimless crime representative
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
made mention to this that harms only
 
03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:05.030 align:start position:0%
made mention to this that harms only
themselves

03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
on this past Thanksgiving morning a
 
03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
single vehicle rollover crash occurred
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the city of Portsmouth
 
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
of the six young adults inside the
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle the driver was properly
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
restrained and suffered minor injury
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
the four individuals in the back seat
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
were unrestrained
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
all four were ejected
 
03:50:26.090 --> 03:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
suffered significant traumatic injuries
 
03:50:30.530 --> 03:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
and one of the individuals lost her life
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
I could say with first-hand knowledge
 
03:50:34.250 --> 03:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
that there are many victims of this
 
03:50:34.260 --> 03:50:35.150 align:start position:0%
that there are many victims of this
crash

03:50:35.150 --> 03:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
crash
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
First Responders trying valiantly to
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
save the lives of those ejected
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
family members that were told that their
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
loved one loved ones were badly injured
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
some suffering injuries so severe that
 
03:50:48.769 --> 03:50:48.779 align:start position:0%
they are likely life-altering one family
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
was told that their loved one had not
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
survived that crash
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
I will conclude my testimony with a
 
03:50:55.729 --> 03:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
personal experience regarding the use of
 
03:50:58.370 --> 03:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
seat belts in January 2016 a college
 
03:51:00.410 --> 03:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
student was returning from dinner to
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
campus at Franklin Pierce University in
 
03:51:02.399 --> 03:51:03.410 align:start position:0%
campus at Franklin Pierce University in
Rindge

03:51:03.410 --> 03:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
Rindge
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
as he rounded a corner on Route 202 in
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
Peterborough the driver noticed a
 
03:51:09.530 --> 03:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
vehicle coming at him head on in his
 
03:51:12.290 --> 03:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
Lane and at a high rate of speed
 
03:51:13.969 --> 03:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
the young man driving took evasive
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
action however he was unable to avoid a
 
03:51:16.020 --> 03:51:17.330 align:start position:0%
action however he was unable to avoid a
collision

03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
collision
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
the speeding vehicle struck him in the
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
area of the driver's side front wheel
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
at what would later be determined by the
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state police car unit as
 
03:51:27.530 --> 03:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
88 miles an hour
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
the victim's vehicle went into a spin
 
03:51:31.490 --> 03:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
and he rolled several times coming to
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
rest on its roof in the middle of route
 
03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:34.429 align:start position:0%
rest on its roof in the middle of route
202.

03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
202.
 
03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
this young man who was wearing a seat
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
belt lost Consciousness as a result of
 
03:51:40.130 --> 03:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
the impact and when emergency Personnel
 
03:51:42.370 --> 03:51:42.380 align:start position:0%
arrived he was found hanging upside down
 
03:51:45.290 --> 03:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
suspended in his seat belt
 
03:51:46.849 --> 03:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
First Responders would later tell me
 
03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
that this young man would clearly have
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
suffered significant injury and likely
 
03:51:51.889 --> 03:51:51.899 align:start position:0%
would have been ejected had he not worn
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
his seatbelt in all likelihood the seat
 
03:51:57.530 --> 03:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
belt saved his life
 
03:51:59.330 --> 03:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
as the offending driver went off to New
 
03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Prison to serve his
 
03:52:01.969 --> 03:52:01.979 align:start position:0%
three to five year sentence the young
 
03:52:03.650 --> 03:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
man who was the victim
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
went on to complete his degree at
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce within 12 hours of
 
03:52:10.010 --> 03:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
completing his last class there he was
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
sworn in as a New Hampshire state
 
03:52:11.460 --> 03:52:12.769 align:start position:0%
sworn in as a New Hampshire state
trooper

03:52:12.769 --> 03:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
trooper
 
03:52:14.450 --> 03:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
where he is now four and a half years
 
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
into a successful career
 
03:52:18.530 --> 03:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to tell you that that Trooper
 
03:52:21.889 --> 03:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
seat belts are the single best way to
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
avoid injury or death should you be
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
involved in a motor vehicle crash that
 
03:52:30.290 --> 03:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
is a fact
 
03:52:31.729 --> 03:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank the committee for
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
their time and I'm happy to answer any
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have

thank you so much any
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee

chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
question can you explain the primary and
 
03:52:49.370 --> 03:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
secondary on your colorful chart
 
03:52:51.050 --> 03:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
primary seat belt law is essentially
 
03:52:52.969 --> 03:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
what representative vayu said primary
 
03:52:54.650 --> 03:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
seat belt law can be enforced without
 
03:52:56.210 --> 03:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
any other motor vehicle violations
 
03:52:58.969 --> 03:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
whereas a secondary seat belt law can be
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
enforced once uh the car has been
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
stopped for something else whether it be
 
03:53:04.729 --> 03:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
speed or any other type of motor vehicle
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%

03:53:51.410 --> 03:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
two daughters one daughter who started
 
03:53:53.809 --> 03:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
driving last year another daughter who
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
started driving this year
 
03:53:58.849 --> 03:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
and so I'm very invested in this bill
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
I've been at Parkland for six years I
 
03:54:03.290 --> 03:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
also serve as the vice chair for the
 
03:54:04.849 --> 03:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
trauma medical Review Committee here at
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
I'm also on that committee under Trauma
 
03:54:10.849 --> 03:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
Nurse representative for the state so
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
I have the honor of representing all the
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
nurses in the state regarding trauma so
 
03:54:17.809 --> 03:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
I just have a couple of patients that I
 
03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
can talk to you about just this year at
 
03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:21.050 align:start position:0%
can talk to you about just this year at
Parkland

03:54:21.050 --> 03:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
Parkland
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh recently with all the icy conditions
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
we've had we saw a family of four
 
03:54:29.150 --> 03:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
um both the driver and the passenger in
 
03:54:31.550 --> 03:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
the front were restrained that two kids
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the back were also restrained and
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
they lost control on the highway High
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
rate of speed they rolled multiple times
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
and they were all able to self-extricate
 
03:54:42.769 --> 03:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
they all came to Parkland
 
03:54:45.290 --> 03:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
um none of them had any major injuries
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
they were all discharged home
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
also this year we had a individual who
 
03:54:54.530 --> 03:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
his car impacted with a pole he was not
 
03:54:54.540 --> 03:54:55.729 align:start position:0%
his car impacted with a pole he was not
restrained

03:54:55.729 --> 03:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
restrained
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh his his airbag did deploy but his
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
head went through the windshield uh he
 
03:55:02.929 --> 03:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
was asystolic on this team which means
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
that he basically his heart was not not
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
beaded on the scene EMS did resuscitate
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
or attempt to resuscitate they were not
 
03:55:12.530 --> 03:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
able to get him back when he got to us
 
03:55:14.809 --> 03:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
he still had no heartbeat we worked him
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
up briefly and he died in the ER
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and then just today there's this
 
03:55:20.520 --> 03:55:21.469 align:start position:0%
um and then just today there's this
morning

03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
as you guys are aware we've we had a lot
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
of icy conditions this morning we had
 
03:55:26.990 --> 03:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
quite a few uh car crashes that came
 
03:55:28.189 --> 03:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
into the ER
 
03:55:30.170 --> 03:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
a couple of those patients were also
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
involved in rollovers they were all
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
restrained they were all worked up they
 
03:55:37.130 --> 03:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
were all discharged home
 
03:55:37.140 --> 03:55:38.090 align:start position:0%
were all discharged home
um

03:55:38.090 --> 03:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
let me just see I've also done a PSA on
 
03:55:43.130 --> 03:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
teen safety recently just talking about
 
03:55:44.450 --> 03:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
seat belt use
 
03:55:47.150 --> 03:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh one thing I know from going with my
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
kids with their education so they are
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
educated as teenagers to wear seat belts
 
03:55:52.969 --> 03:55:52.979 align:start position:0%
they see all the videos they know the
 
03:55:55.729 --> 03:55:55.739 align:start position:0%
dangers and they're also aware that in
 
03:55:57.290 --> 03:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at the age of 18 they
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
could remove those seat belts and as the
 
03:56:02.090 --> 03:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
trooper mentioned behind us so the
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
accident Portsmouth there were
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
individuals there who were in their
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
early twenties who'd all gone through
 
03:56:08.330 --> 03:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
that training and they did remove their
 
03:56:09.769 --> 03:56:09.779 align:start position:0%
seat belts so
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
we do need more incentive to get people
 
03:56:13.849 --> 03:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
to wear their seat belts it does save
 
03:56:13.859 --> 03:56:15.769 align:start position:0%
to wear their seat belts it does save
lives

03:56:15.769 --> 03:56:15.779 align:start position:0%
lives
 
03:56:18.410 --> 03:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
and that's my testimony if you guys have
 
03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you so much any
 
03:56:23.210 --> 03:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you so much thank
 
03:56:25.319 --> 03:56:29.990 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you so much thank
you

03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
chair now like to recognize Gary Woods
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%

03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill and is seeking
 
03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.650 --> 03:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you

nhms's New Hampshire Medical Society for
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
those who may not know the anachronym
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
um my name is Gary Woods
 
03:57:06.530 --> 03:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm in strong support of House Bill 222
 
03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
from a variety of venues first of all I
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
understand the basic science behind it
 
03:57:15.610 --> 03:57:15.620 align:start position:0%
as I was originally a physicist through
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
graduate school before I went to medical
 
03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:19.490 align:start position:0%
graduate school before I went to medical
school

03:57:19.490 --> 03:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:57:19.500 --> 03:57:20.889 align:start position:0%
school
um

03:57:20.889 --> 03:57:20.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:23.469 --> 03:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
became an orthopedic surgeon
 
03:57:25.969 --> 03:57:25.979 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
with the recipient sometimes two and
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
three in the morning of the people
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
you've heard talked about it was up to
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
us to
 
03:57:35.570 --> 03:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
to put the pieces back together if we
 
03:57:37.490 --> 03:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
possibly could
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I kind of give a little bit of my own
 
03:57:46.969 --> 03:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
history which gives give you an idea of
 
03:57:49.610 --> 03:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
why I'm here but also a little bit of
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
why we're all here uh first of all a
 
03:57:54.650 --> 03:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
hundred years or 50 years ago we didn't
 
03:57:56.090 --> 03:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
have cars so this would have been a
 
03:57:58.130 --> 03:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
non-issue obviously
 
03:57:58.140 --> 03:57:58.849 align:start position:0%
non-issue obviously
um

03:57:58.849 --> 03:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:02.210 --> 03:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
I have long contact with the safety belt
 
03:58:02.220 --> 03:58:03.490 align:start position:0%
I have long contact with the safety belt
issue

03:58:03.490 --> 03:58:03.500 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:58:06.050 --> 03:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
again from the basic science perspective
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
but the medical perspective both through
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
the emergency room but also the
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up care which you've heard
 
03:58:12.720 --> 03:58:13.790 align:start position:0%
follow-up care which you've heard
mentioned

03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:58:13.800 --> 03:58:16.130 align:start position:0%
mentioned
um

03:58:16.130 --> 03:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:18.410 --> 03:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
first of all I was in practice started
 
03:58:22.969 --> 03:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
in 76 my first office partner with a MIT
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
trained engineer he was a senior faculty
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
member and we ran an 80 bed Orthopedic
 
03:58:32.150 --> 03:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
award at the teaching Hospital
 
03:58:32.160 --> 03:58:34.309 align:start position:0%
award at the teaching Hospital
um

03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
he did the engineering work initially
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
for safety builds or General Motors and
 
03:58:44.150 --> 03:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
Ford was under contract and published
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
the scientific data but showed the
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
efficacy of safety builds
 
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
as a consequence he sought to have a
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
legislation for New York which was
 
03:59:01.550 --> 03:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
passed the first in the nation
 
03:59:04.969 --> 03:59:04.979 align:start position:0%
the state of New of New York awarded him
 
03:59:07.150 --> 03:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
the Excalibur award
 
03:59:10.729 --> 03:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
for the service to the people and
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
citizens of of New York it's the highest
 
03:59:16.670 --> 03:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
award you can give a in a private
 
03:59:16.680 --> 03:59:18.710 align:start position:0%
award you can give a in a private
citizen

03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's that contact both in the basic
 
03:59:23.450 --> 03:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
science and the educational and
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
legislative part that I moved here in
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
1982 to continue that work I got a grant
 
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
from the motor vehicle manufacturers
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
Association where they gave Monies to
 
03:59:38.689 --> 03:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
each state I ran that for five or six
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
years but they realized that wait a
 
03:59:42.000 --> 03:59:43.189 align:start position:0%
years but they realized that wait a
minute

03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
minute
 
03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
as you heard New Hampshire is the only
 
03:59:48.410 --> 03:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't have legislation for
 
03:59:48.420 --> 03:59:50.710 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't have legislation for
adult

03:59:50.710 --> 03:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
adult
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
safety belts they said we've done our
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
job since there's only one state left we
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
lost our money and now we've been trying
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.050 --> 04:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
so it's with that background that I
 
04:00:04.809 --> 04:00:04.819 align:start position:0%
approached this problem
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to skip some of the data
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
you've heard that and you'll probably
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
hear more of it but instead I'd like to
 
04:00:13.849 --> 04:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
focus on two issues the petitional
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
potential negative effects of safety
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
belts and how safety belts are an
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
effective preventive measure
 
04:00:22.849 --> 04:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
negative effects
 
04:00:25.370 --> 04:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
in Nash in in New Hampshire we're
 
04:00:28.250 --> 04:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes very much made aware uh that
 
04:00:30.889 --> 04:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
one of the most visible was a newspaper
 
04:00:33.130 --> 04:00:33.140 align:start position:0%
publisher at the union leader Naki Loeb
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
was involved in a vehicle accident and
 
04:00:39.410 --> 04:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
it was clearly stated that had she been
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
wearing a safety belt she would be dead
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
and indeed that's true
 
04:00:45.610 --> 04:00:45.620 align:start position:0%
the reason was
 
04:00:49.849 --> 04:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
she was a passenger and a post-world War
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
II Jeep vehicle now you remember what
 
04:00:56.689 --> 04:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
they look like other than
 
04:00:59.090 --> 04:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
the little windshield that comes up on a
 
04:01:01.490 --> 04:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
hinge there's nothing above your seat
 
04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
in a rollover she was indeed saved
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
because she was thrown free had she been
 
04:01:09.050 --> 04:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
a safety belt and that she would have
 
04:01:10.729 --> 04:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
been crushed
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
04:01:14.450 --> 04:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
not the vehicles we drive today
 
04:01:16.250 --> 04:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
they're very much different
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
the work that was done by Dr States as I
 
04:01:18.600 --> 04:01:19.550 align:start position:0%
the work that was done by Dr States as I
mentioned

04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:01:21.650 --> 04:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
and the industry itself took the
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
initiative to put in measures so that
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
they're easily available easily used and
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
very efficacious
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
did you do have a minor
 
04:01:34.969 --> 04:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
negative effect nothing's perfect
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
even the best medication has some side
 
04:01:37.199 --> 04:01:38.510 align:start position:0%
even the best medication has some side
effects

04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
effects
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
not using safety belts
 
04:01:44.929 --> 04:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
because there's a small
 
04:01:44.939 --> 04:01:46.670 align:start position:0%
because there's a small
percent

04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
then it might be dangerous
 
04:01:50.450 --> 04:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
can because first of all you might not
 
04:01:52.250 --> 04:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
be using it properly and that's where
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of belt injuries come
 
04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
from from misuse
 
04:01:59.389 --> 04:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
but the perspective of just not using it
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be like if you're a skier and most
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
of us are here in New Hampshire
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's a small a percent even if you do
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
the best you can to get your skis and
 
04:02:10.610 --> 04:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
your your bindings everything fit just
 
04:02:10.620 --> 04:02:11.870 align:start position:0%
your your bindings everything fit just
right

04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:02:14.269 --> 04:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's a small percent that they're
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to release early and cause you
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
major injury
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want to take a small percent
 
04:02:22.250 --> 04:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
chance you don't want that to happen so
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
to avoid that small percent
 
04:02:26.040 --> 04:02:27.590 align:start position:0%
to avoid that small percent
chance

04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
chance
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to bolt your bolts to your
 
04:02:30.120 --> 04:02:32.090 align:start position:0%
you're going to bolt your bolts to your
skis

04:02:32.090 --> 04:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
skis
 
04:02:34.490 --> 04:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
they won't release early that way you've
 
04:02:37.370 --> 04:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
avoided that very small percent but
 
04:02:40.729 --> 04:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
you've exposed yourself to horrific
 
04:02:40.739 --> 04:02:47.870 align:start position:0%
you've exposed yourself to horrific
consequences

04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.550 --> 04:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
we also hear as the topics being brought
 
04:02:54.290 --> 04:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
infringing on our personal freedoms it
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
is a negative effect
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
that one must ask whose freedom
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
and you've heard allusion to the
 
04:03:01.199 --> 04:03:02.510 align:start position:0%
and you've heard allusion to the
consequences

04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
04:03:05.450 --> 04:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
not only for the person who sustains the
 
04:03:08.809 --> 04:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
injury but the families
 
04:03:11.210 --> 04:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
for the employer he has to if you're out
 
04:03:12.769 --> 04:03:12.779 align:start position:0%
of work
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
disrupts production disrupts him so
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's the consequences that you see
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
after that
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
and also if you have long-term
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
difficulties you expect
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
your neighbor
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
me to take care of you
 
04:03:30.600 --> 04:03:32.510 align:start position:0%
me to take care of you
right

04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
now let me ask you
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
if you really said I really have to have
 
04:03:40.010 --> 04:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
my freedoms
 
04:03:42.889 --> 04:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
and I will I'm as a consequence I'm
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
willing to sign a waiver
 
04:03:46.729 --> 04:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
that if I need long-term care because
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'm a quad
 
04:03:51.170 --> 04:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
and costing a million dollars a year
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh for the state to take care of me
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
no you don't have to do that because
 
04:03:58.130 --> 04:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
what you're asking you want your
 
04:03:58.140 --> 04:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
what you're asking you want your
freedoms

04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
freedoms
 
04:04:01.969 --> 04:04:01.979 align:start position:0%
but I have no freedom I have to pay
 
04:04:01.979 --> 04:04:03.050 align:start position:0%
but I have no freedom I have to pay
taxes

04:04:03.050 --> 04:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
to take care of you
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
we have to go back on what is the common
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
good you do what you can if you've done
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
what you can
 
04:04:16.370 --> 04:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to participate at
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
two or three in the morning even if you
 
04:04:19.370 --> 04:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.269 --> 04:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
first of all you've heard that you have
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
better control of your car and I won't
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
go through all of that
 
04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
there's much diminished extent of direct
 
04:04:42.889 --> 04:04:42.899 align:start position:0%
injury being ejected or indirectly
 
04:04:42.899 --> 04:04:43.729 align:start position:0%
injury being ejected or indirectly
um

04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
that won't go over all that you've heard
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
that story and it's somewhat obvious
 
04:04:47.760 --> 04:04:48.769 align:start position:0%
that story and it's somewhat obvious
anyway

04:04:48.769 --> 04:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:04:52.250 --> 04:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
in closing what I would like to do
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
is to ask you a question
 
04:04:57.050 --> 04:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a physician
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
although I'm retired I'm a physician and
 
04:05:03.290 --> 04:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.530 --> 04:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
and it said it would save say well on
 
04:05:09.050 --> 04:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
average 13 lives a year and Untold
 
04:05:09.060 --> 04:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
average 13 lives a year and Untold
injuries

04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
but only I could sign it
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
what would you think if I put that
 
04:05:18.170 --> 04:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
prescription in my pocket
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
and walked out
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
leaving 13 to 15 people dead
 
04:05:28.969 --> 04:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
how do you think that would go with the
 
04:05:30.840 --> 04:05:31.849 align:start position:0%
how do you think that would go with the
public

04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
how do you think that would go with the
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
I have such a prescription
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
you can
 
04:05:54.889 --> 04:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
you can sign the prescription
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
that saves lives
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
and prevents injuries and it says right
 
04:06:00.000 --> 04:06:00.769 align:start position:0%
and prevents injuries and it says right
here

04:06:00.769 --> 04:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:06:04.010 --> 04:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
signed New Hampshire legislator and I
 
04:06:05.689 --> 04:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
leave that with you
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:10.010 --> 04:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
04:06:10.020 --> 04:06:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
committee

04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee

representative Sinclair
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:06:18.410 --> 04:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
it seems like you've done a lot of work
 
04:06:20.330 --> 04:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
from what I've just heard in your
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
testimony up with the manufacturers uh
 
04:06:25.969 --> 04:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
over your the course of your career has
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
there been any encouragement from your
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
group or other groups for the public
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
safety tool to get the manufacturers uh
 
04:06:37.010 --> 04:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
to make the vehicles unable to start
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
until the belt is engaged like they've
 
04:06:44.150 --> 04:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
got the technology now to make it so I
 
04:06:46.490 --> 04:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
can't put my car in gear without tapping
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
the brake first so as an example
 
04:06:51.050 --> 04:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes there were that was
 
04:06:54.889 --> 04:06:54.899 align:start position:0%
considered way back probably I'm taking
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
a guess here probably mid 90s is that
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
far back that was considered
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
um and it was elected not to do that for
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up follow-up
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
would you maybe in light of all the
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
testimony here and even with these
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
figures maybe give a push again for that
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
I would certainly entertain that uh yeah
 
04:07:22.010 --> 04:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a sidebar uh it does it
 
04:07:24.530 --> 04:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
has a tendency in getting going down
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
that rabbit hole what we have currently
 
04:07:30.170 --> 04:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
in place is free
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
easy to use and we know is just
 
04:07:36.110 --> 04:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
immensely successful
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you and trying to go even that
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
step further would might negate that
 
04:07:42.479 --> 04:07:44.630 align:start position:0%
step further would might negate that
progress

04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
progress
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
chair now like to recognize Roger
 
04:07:58.969 --> 04:07:58.979 align:start position:0%

Richard I'm 60 years old native of New
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire born in Manchester Notre Dame
 
04:08:18.359 --> 04:08:20.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire born in Manchester Notre Dame
Hospital

04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
04:08:22.490 --> 04:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
I had never worn a seatbelt in my own
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle
 
04:08:27.889 --> 04:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
been driving the roads for 45 years
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
I did wear a seat belt for 33 years at
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
my job I was a mailman I had to or I was
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to get fired or if I got in an
 
04:08:39.889 --> 04:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
accident I could not get my bills paid
 
04:08:42.349 --> 04:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
so I made a choice
 
04:08:44.090 --> 04:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
stay at the post office because a
 
04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
long-term benefit that time was good for
 
04:08:46.620 --> 04:08:47.870 align:start position:0%
long-term benefit that time was good for
myself

04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:08:50.090 --> 04:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
I could have left I could have made a
 
04:08:50.100 --> 04:08:51.050 align:start position:0%
I could have left I could have made a
choice

04:08:51.050 --> 04:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
there are people behind me that are in
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that can also make the
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
choice when they say oh I see people
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
this way that way mangled you have the
 
04:08:59.040 --> 04:09:00.650 align:start position:0%
this way that way mangled you have the
choice

04:09:00.650 --> 04:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
we are guaranteed oh excuse me I was I
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
was also called In This Very building
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
over 30 years ago a child hater because
 
04:09:12.530 --> 04:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
I opposed the children's seat belt not
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
because I hate children because it's
 
04:09:16.250 --> 04:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
called incrementalism
 
04:09:18.530 --> 04:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
it went from age they told me oh you're
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
just too you think way too much went
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
from 6 12 18 and you've been knocking on
 
04:09:26.330 --> 04:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
my door ever since shame on this it's
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
really wrong to tell people we only
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
worry about the children and then try to
 
04:09:32.809 --> 04:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
back door you it's not good okay it's
 
04:09:34.250 --> 04:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
not good for a native of New Hampshire
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
to be backdoored
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
I've been in New Hampshire for 56 out of
 
04:09:42.110 --> 04:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
the 60 years I was in the Army for four
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
years defending our Liberty our New
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way of life
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
I don't want to give it up
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
if you want to wear a seatbelt please do
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
it you have it don't make me I've heard
 
04:09:56.210 --> 04:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
all kinds of stuff here about
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
accountability well I am accountable I
 
04:10:00.650 --> 04:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
have been accountable and I make my
 
04:10:02.330 --> 04:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
children accountable I'm trying to make
 
04:10:06.170 --> 04:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
um talking about oh the taxes the taxes
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
of the people that get an accident
 
04:10:12.769 --> 04:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
without without these seat belt well
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
people get in accidents with seat belts
 
04:10:16.849 --> 04:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
and without seat belts and the cost is
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same hospitals are
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
outrageous now the taxes we have
 
04:10:26.330 --> 04:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
141 people I believe last year dinar and
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
our our highways
 
04:10:31.870 --> 04:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
40 000 in the highways Across the Nation
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
141 without a seat belt and still close
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
to 40 000 had died with seat belts
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see the scale
 
04:10:45.290 --> 04:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
the taxation part again
 
04:10:45.300 --> 04:10:46.309 align:start position:0%
the taxation part again
um

04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:48.410 --> 04:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
I have noticed for years and years and
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
years we have a drug epidemic that's
 
04:10:53.689 --> 04:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
costing us all all
 
04:10:56.889 --> 04:10:56.899 align:start position:0%
okay a lot of money Narcan
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing you name it everything because
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
we create it and I mean we and I'm gonna
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
specifically say
 
04:11:06.889 --> 04:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
doctors were involved in the creation of
 
04:11:08.769 --> 04:11:08.779 align:start position:0%
it so when a doctor talks to me about
 
04:11:11.809 --> 04:11:11.819 align:start position:0%
saving money on taxes think about what
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
you created first they gave drugs away
 
04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
like they're going out of style now I
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
have to pay and now you want me to take
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
my my Liberty and just give it up
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
because of payment it doesn't make sense
 
04:11:27.170 --> 04:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
to me the scales aren't there again
 
04:11:29.150 --> 04:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
um the Constitution the reason why I am
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
so adamant I my principles have not
 
04:11:32.640 --> 04:11:34.370 align:start position:0%
so adamant I my principles have not
changed

04:11:34.370 --> 04:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:11:36.410 --> 04:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
I believe in the Constitution I believe
 
04:11:38.330 --> 04:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
I defended it I took an oath just like
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
every one of you took an oath uphold the
 
04:11:42.410 --> 04:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution against enemies foreign and
 
04:11:42.420 --> 04:11:43.670 align:start position:0%
Constitution against enemies foreign and
domestic

04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
04:11:45.530 --> 04:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
I believe anyone that goes after the
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution is an enemy I don't care
 
04:11:50.090 --> 04:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
where they're from
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution covers all of us equally
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter your race your
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
color your Creed anything
 
04:11:57.960 --> 04:12:01.450 align:start position:0%
color your Creed anything
foreign

04:12:01.450 --> 04:12:01.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.689 --> 04:12:04.699 align:start position:0%
state constitution guarantees me
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
unalienable right of Liberty
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
I looked it up in the dictionary Liberty
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
is the right to choose
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
I have that right to choose
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
now article 3 of our state constitution
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the parentheses and I I'm not going
 
04:12:23.090 --> 04:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
to pull it up okay I'm going to give it
 
04:12:24.530 --> 04:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
to you paraphrase that might be a word
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
or two off please correct me and I will
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
accept whatever you say on it
 
04:12:33.790 --> 04:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's about Society
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
organization and purpose
 
04:12:38.570 --> 04:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
we're all in a society here
 
04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
when men enter into a state of society
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
they surrender up some of their natural
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
rights to ensure the protection of
 
04:12:49.250 --> 04:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
others if the law is not as equivalent
 
04:12:52.610 --> 04:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
the surrender is void 1784.
 
04:12:55.130 --> 04:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
now let me give a little for people that
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
might not have understood what I said
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
when men enter and when men enter into a
 
04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
state of society we surrender up some of
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
our natural rights I told you my natural
 
04:13:07.370 --> 04:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
right is Liberty do I Surrender up my
 
04:13:10.250 --> 04:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
Liberty my choice to choose I don't
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
think I Surrender it's unalienable
 
04:13:15.170 --> 04:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
they surrender map to ensure the
 
04:13:17.570 --> 04:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
protection of others wait a minute my
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
Liberty of freedom of speech and a movie
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
theater is suspended because others are
 
04:13:26.150 --> 04:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
involved because if I yell fire
 
04:13:29.330 --> 04:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
Stampede people are dead
 
04:13:33.650 --> 04:13:33.660 align:start position:0%

04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
not anybody else I've heard projectiles
 
04:13:40.969 --> 04:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
and again I've been to every single
 
04:13:42.290 --> 04:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
meeting except for one because my
 
04:13:44.809 --> 04:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
grandchild was in surgery since it
 
04:13:44.819 --> 04:13:48.710 align:start position:0%
grandchild was in surgery since it
started

04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.720 --> 04:13:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
I lost my track
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
the accountability part
 
04:13:57.650 --> 04:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
icle 4 of our constitution guarantees us
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
a conscience
 
04:14:02.269 --> 04:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
I have automobile insurance never went
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
without it I have health insurance never
 
04:14:07.370 --> 04:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
went without it I have disability
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
insurance never went without it I've got
 
04:14:12.170 --> 04:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
jobs and held jobs with sick leave and
 
04:14:14.689 --> 04:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
vacation time and different things
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
I've been accountable
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I need to take the hit
 
04:14:21.889 --> 04:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
because I'm accountable and I'm also
 
04:14:23.150 --> 04:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
teaching other people how to be
 
04:14:25.250 --> 04:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
accountable we should not have to take a
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
hit on our Liberty Liberty because
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
somebody thinks whoa I I saw this I saw
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
that these people are mangled yes it
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
happens people can make on bicycles fall
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
off horses die
 
04:14:40.370 --> 04:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
airbags airbags are in automobiles
 
04:14:40.380 --> 04:14:42.170 align:start position:0%
airbags airbags are in automobiles
airbags

04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
airbags
 
04:14:44.150 --> 04:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
are not reliable
 
04:14:45.650 --> 04:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
companies are going out of business
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
worldwide because they're airbags are
 
04:14:47.699 --> 04:14:49.630 align:start position:0%
worldwide because they're airbags are
defective

04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
defective
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
seat belts number one thing I believe
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
seat belts cause in an accident is a
 
04:14:57.650 --> 04:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
dissection of the Carotid artery because
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
it grabs you right there and the first
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
thing they do is they look at you and
 
04:15:02.929 --> 04:15:02.939 align:start position:0%
they look to see if your pupils are
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
dilated because it's called Horner
 
04:15:04.080 --> 04:15:05.150 align:start position:0%
dilated because it's called Horner
syndrome

04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
one of the number one things so wearing
 
04:15:09.290 --> 04:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
a seat belt could injure me or it could
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
not injure me wearing a seatbelt or not
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
wearing a seatbelt I believe I have the
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
same faith
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter to me again 45 years
 
04:15:21.410 --> 04:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
legally in New Hampshire I'm still here
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
not that I'm I'm boasting about it but
 
04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen to everybody and
 
04:15:28.849 --> 04:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
everybody should not have to take the
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's also been said marketing didn't
 
04:15:37.560 --> 04:15:38.689 align:start position:0%
it's also been said marketing didn't
work

04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
well why do I still hear my tax money
 
04:15:44.450 --> 04:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
going into the radio waves about oh
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
buckle up your kids oh they sound like
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
wolves make them sound like wolves the
 
04:15:50.689 --> 04:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
kids are bad why do we do that if it's
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
not working why are we making our kids
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
sound bad we've already buckled them up
 
04:15:56.450 --> 04:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be good
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
I I don't think I have any more to say I
 
04:16:00.530 --> 04:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and um
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
I oppose this and for our constitution
 
04:16:06.290 --> 04:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%

04:16:19.370 --> 04:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
Constitution very closely I tried my
 
04:16:19.380 --> 04:16:22.510 align:start position:0%
Constitution very closely I tried my
best

04:16:22.510 --> 04:16:22.520 align:start position:0%

questions
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
so you don't wear one because you don't
 
04:16:35.450 --> 04:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
like being told what to do or okay or
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
let me say so or is it because they're
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable uncomfortable and that
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
would if I did start wearing it I'd be
 
04:16:44.809 --> 04:16:44.819 align:start position:0%
violating another law that you people
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
passed would be the distraction law
 
04:16:50.269 --> 04:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
I feel comfortable not wearing it I'm
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
not distracted if I'm wearing it I'm
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
distracted I'm always I'd be violating
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
another loss so which way do I go again
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%

04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you very
 
04:17:03.840 --> 04:17:04.670 align:start position:0%

much
 
04:17:06.530 --> 04:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay chair now I'd like to recognize Dan
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
Goodman from AAA
 
04:17:11.450 --> 04:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill and also has some
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and for the record
 
04:17:40.610 --> 04:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Goodman and I'm the
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
public affairs manager for AAA Northern
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
New England and I'm here in support of
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:17:45.479 --> 04:17:47.809 align:start position:0%
the bill
um

04:17:47.809 --> 04:17:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's it I'll try not to repeat some of
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
the the facts and figures that have been
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
04:17:56.210 --> 04:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
um the simplest
 
04:17:59.330 --> 04:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
and most cost-effective way that we can
 
04:18:02.330 --> 04:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
reduce injuries deaths and Associated
 
04:18:04.849 --> 04:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
economic costs on New Hampshire highways
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
today is by buckling up your safety belt
 
04:18:13.130 --> 04:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
in the most recent study survey that is
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:18:16.130 --> 04:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
they say that seat belts across the
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
country saved almost 15 000 lives
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
it's estimated if New Hampshire had a
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
seat belt lock today
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
that we would save lives serious
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
injuries and up to 22 million dollars in
 
04:18:29.570 --> 04:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
Associated costs
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
and part of that is due to
 
04:18:34.969 --> 04:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
that inpatient costs for unbelted crash
 
04:18:38.090 --> 04:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
victims are 55 percent higher than
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
belted crash victims
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
according to the most recent studies if
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
you buckle up in the front seat of your
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
your car you reduce the injury of a
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
fatal injury by 45 percent
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
and moderate to your critical injury by
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.729 --> 04:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:19:01.429 --> 04:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
it this might make some members happy or
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
we did our first or we recently did a
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
survey of AAA members and non-members
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire
 
04:19:12.530 --> 04:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
to see if they supported a seat belt law
 
04:19:15.349 --> 04:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
it was and 91 percent
 
04:19:18.490 --> 04:19:18.500 align:start position:0%
support of seat belt law
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
so today this is a bill that if it
 
04:19:24.250 --> 04:19:24.260 align:start position:0%
passes will save lives decrease injuries
 
04:19:26.929 --> 04:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
and lower the associated social costs
 
04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
associated with a crash this is
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
supported across the state Across the
 
04:19:31.319 --> 04:19:33.530 align:start position:0%
supported across the state Across the
Nation

04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
Nation
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned I'll repeat it
 
04:19:38.450 --> 04:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
because it's it's for us who are in this
 
04:19:40.370 --> 04:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
field that's an alarming
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
thing to say but New Hampshire is the
 
04:19:43.490 --> 04:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
only state
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
the only state without a seat belt law
 
04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
consequently we have the lowest safety
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
belt use in the country
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
and the highest unbelted fatality rate
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
at 58 percent
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the other states off
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
top my head around
 
04:20:02.269 --> 04:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
us do but I do know that I believe
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont is 38 percent
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
so 38 percent of their fatalities are
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
unbelted and we are over half it's a
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's a very Stark difference
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:20:17.330 --> 04:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I get oh the last thing I'll say in
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
on the back of my chart I uh include
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
some statistics on you know what the
 
04:20:24.410 --> 04:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
seat belt uses in our in our compared to
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
the states around us as was mentioned
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
the national average is the
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
Captain better may have had more
 
04:20:33.650 --> 04:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
up-to-date data I had 20 21 data
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so it was 91.6 was the national
 
04:20:38.450 --> 04:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
average Vermont at 89.2 percent in Maine
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
at 91.8 percent
 
04:20:43.130 --> 04:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
and you can see our unbelted fatality
 
04:20:45.769 --> 04:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
rate over the last five years
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
um it is improving but it's still I
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
think unacceptable as we've we've talked
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
on multiple highway safety issues one
 
04:20:55.490 --> 04:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
victim one fatality is just too many
 
04:20:55.500 --> 04:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
victim one fatality is just too many
um

04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know safety belts are designed to
 
04:21:00.889 --> 04:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
help the motorists maintain position
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel to better control the
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle during a skidder Collision
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
safety belt become standard because they
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
help ride down the force of a crash and
 
04:21:12.170 --> 04:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
reduce the impact between the occupant
 
04:21:15.050 --> 04:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
and the vehicle interior interior safety
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
belt significantly reduced injury the
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
risk excuse me of being thrown from a
 
04:21:19.680 --> 04:21:20.809 align:start position:0%
risk excuse me of being thrown from a
vehicle

04:21:20.809 --> 04:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
and with that that's uh my testimony I'm
 
04:21:26.809 --> 04:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you um could you
 
04:21:35.929 --> 04:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
give us the number of people that you
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
surveyed in New Hampshire do you have
 
04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
that number
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
um you said 91 of your survey
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
um agreed to for seat belts for New
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but how many people did you
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
survey do you know I will I will email
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
you that
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
um they just told me when I when I asked
 
04:21:53.090 --> 04:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
the statisticians
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
um in our department I uh they just told
 
04:21:57.290 --> 04:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
me it was statistically significant
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
because I asked how well does this
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
represent AAA members which is 520 530
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
000 members in the state of New
 
04:22:06.050 --> 04:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our population and they
 
04:22:07.010 --> 04:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
just told me it statistically
 
04:22:09.110 --> 04:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
significant but I'll follow up I didn't
 
04:22:10.490 --> 04:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
ask exactly how many but I will get you
 
04:22:11.809 --> 04:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
that information thank you for the
 
04:22:11.819 --> 04:22:12.590 align:start position:0%
that information thank you for the
question

04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you and
 
04:22:18.410 --> 04:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
you get the data here in your handout it
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
says lack of safety belts drugged and
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and speeding are
 
04:22:25.800 --> 04:22:27.050 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and speeding are
those

04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
all the same line like with unseated or
 
04:22:33.530 --> 04:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
unbelted people no no no those are just
 
04:22:35.929 --> 04:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
the top reasons independent and many of
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
in many of those happen at the same time
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
but that they're independent they are
 
04:22:42.530 --> 04:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
just the top reasons we are seeing an
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
increase in fatalities in this state
 
04:22:47.210 --> 04:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for the question I
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you and
 
04:22:51.290 --> 04:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
um I I had asked I want to have this on
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
the record because I know we talked
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
about this before but has has AAA
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
encouraged manufacturers to do their
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
part to make it
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
um technical that make it technically
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
impossible to start your vehicle without
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
the uh belts being
 
04:23:08.809 --> 04:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
engaged through make up for all the
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
people who are not doing it
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm unaware
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
if we've ever engaged in manufacturers
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
to have that discussion
 
04:23:17.570 --> 04:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
um it was interesting to hear with Dr
 
04:23:19.969 --> 04:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
Woods please said about that but it's
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
something I I think it's a it's a good
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
conversation to to continue I I'd like
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
to as a triple A Member I hope you do
 
04:23:28.250 --> 04:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you for the
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
question representative sellers
 
04:23:33.229 --> 04:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
so on your second paragraph here you
 
04:23:38.090 --> 04:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
have especially in bold print it says
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
according to a 22 2023 survey of AAA
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
members and non-members of New Hampshire
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
all right so our the AAA members all of
 
04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents
 
04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
this was a survey that was only for AAA
 
04:23:56.929 --> 04:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
members and now so it was only for New
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes follow-up
 
04:23:59.640 --> 04:24:01.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes follow-up
follow-up

04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:24:04.130 --> 04:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
my second question is
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
you're here representing AAA why are you
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
actually putting in non AAA members I'm
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
a triple A Member and I'm just wondering
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
to me are you representing Triple A or
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
are you
 
04:24:17.630 --> 04:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
representing AAA and others
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question I I
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
do work for AAA in representing Triple A
 
04:24:24.530 --> 04:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I will
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to representative
 
04:24:27.889 --> 04:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
Crawford as well I'll follow up with the
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
the statisticians to figure out to
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
determine why they chose to include
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
members and AAA members in the same
 
04:24:34.199 --> 04:24:35.210 align:start position:0%
members and AAA members in the same
survey

04:24:35.210 --> 04:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
does that is that acceptable yeah I
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
think it would I think it would clear up
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
your numbers thank you
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I too am a triple A Member and
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
I have a marketing degree my guess is
 
04:24:54.530 --> 04:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
going to be is that uh
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
um is that probably you just took a
 
04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
survey you hired somebody to do a survey
 
04:24:59.809 --> 04:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
of drivers many of whom are AAA members
 
04:25:01.729 --> 04:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
so that was probably you were probably
 
04:25:03.530 --> 04:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
actually sampling drivers some of whom
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
are many of whom are AAA members and
 
04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
some of whom aren't many who aren't but
 
04:25:10.010 --> 04:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
my question is the unbuilted fatality
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
rate what are you dividing by what since
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
I assume um
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
I assume probably there's lots of car
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
accidents where no one is killed like in
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
probably some of those people are
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
unbelted so what exactly what exactly is
 
04:25:25.370 --> 04:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
it you're a dividing what by what to get
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
that 58 percent
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
um this data comes from the state and my
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
assumption is and uh feel for the office
 
04:25:38.530 --> 04:25:38.540 align:start position:0%
of Highway Safety uh feel free to
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
correct me here but I believe it's they
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
look at the number of fatalities and
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
then they determine how many then you
 
04:25:47.809 --> 04:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
know in those police reports you can
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
determine if they're wearing their seat
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
belt if they weren't wearing their seat
 
04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
belt so it's the number of fatalities
 
04:25:55.130 --> 04:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
where they were not wearing a seat belt
 
04:25:58.969 --> 04:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
and so it's the percentage of that total
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
that sounds plausible to me I'm going to
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
infer for example that about 60 of the
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
people who die in car crashes aren't
 
04:26:07.969 --> 04:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
belted even though only 25 percent of
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
them are in fact unbelted according to
 
04:26:13.729 --> 04:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
the other numbers we have okay thanks
 
04:26:16.130 --> 04:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:26:16.140 --> 04:26:23.630 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
representative

04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.929 --> 04:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
wondering how many uh fatalities there
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
are wearing belts
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
again I I if I'm wrong in explaining
 
04:26:40.010 --> 04:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
this data highway safety please jump in
 
04:26:42.410 --> 04:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
here or clarify this after my testimony
 
04:26:45.649 --> 04:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
but I would assume it is
 
04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
so if in 2022 the unbeltailed fatality
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
rate is 50 58 I don't know if it would
 
04:26:55.490 --> 04:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
exactly be 42 percent I know that maybe
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
some the it's an unknown that's my
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
assumption I I I don't know if that's a
 
04:27:03.290 --> 04:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
fact but it could be as high as 42
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
percent for the most recent I would just
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
think it's the you know you want to get
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
to 100 so it's
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
you subtract 58 from 100 and you get 42.
 
04:27:13.729 --> 04:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:15.410 --> 04:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:27:17.330 --> 04:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you so much thank
 
04:27:17.340 --> 04:27:20.269 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you so much thank
you

04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
chair do I like to recognize Eric Martin
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire cot
 
04:27:28.010 --> 04:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill who is asking for
 
04:27:30.290 --> 04:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you this is on correct
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for allowing me to speak
 
04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
I have been here on two previous
 
04:27:39.410 --> 04:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
opportunities to speak in support of
 
04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
similar bills and I'm here again today
 
04:27:42.410 --> 04:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned to speak in support of
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 222 as a point of background
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a trauma surgeon at Dartmouth
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock I've been there going on 12
 
04:27:50.689 --> 04:27:50.699 align:start position:0%
years currently I'm the trauma medical
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
director at that institution I share the
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
role of chair and co-chair I'm the chair
 
04:27:56.929 --> 04:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire trauma medical
 
04:27:59.929 --> 04:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
Review Committee I'm the chair of the
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter of the committee
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
on trauma which is an organization of
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
I have not I was not you know I'm not a
 
04:28:11.090 --> 04:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
native born New Hampshire person I get
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
that but uh for point of reference I
 
04:28:14.570 --> 04:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
spent five years in the Marine Corps
 
04:28:16.250 --> 04:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
serving our country for the same rights
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
as everybody else so I do choose to live
 
04:28:19.729 --> 04:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I've been here seven
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
years 17 years and I I have no plans on
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
leaving and I hope to retire here
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here representing myself as a
 
04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
citizen as well as a trauma surgeon and
 
04:28:30.050 --> 04:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
the co team membership
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
I last spoke here five years ago and I
 
04:28:34.130 --> 04:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
know that because I look back at my my
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
notes and there was a my testimony there
 
04:28:37.610 --> 04:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
where I shared a story of two young men
 
04:28:41.210 --> 04:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
who died it was very emotional still is
 
04:28:43.610 --> 04:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
um but I felt like trying to share that
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
story again is going to be the loss
 
04:28:45.359 --> 04:28:46.429 align:start position:0%
story again is going to be the loss
because

04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
we hear about all these reasons as to
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
why we don't need seat belts because
 
04:28:52.130 --> 04:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
it's a personal choice I think these two
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
young men died in their 20s probably
 
04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
because when I was in my 20s I did a lot
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
of silly things too but overall I was
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the laws and try to do
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
the right thing but you kind of need
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
those guidances those moments to allow
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
you to live long enough to learn the
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
responsible choices that are required to
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
to become a you know a member of society
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
and a contributing member of society
 
04:29:17.090 --> 04:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
both of their lives were cut short so as
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
as much as it is hard to talk about that
 
04:29:20.330 --> 04:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
story I thought I would talk about some
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
data and I got this data from the New
 
04:29:23.929 --> 04:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire office of Highway Safety it
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
was shared with me we talked about a lot
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
of numbers but to your point of how many
 
04:29:29.090 --> 04:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
people were died and this has died at
 
04:29:32.450 --> 04:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
over 2022 or excuse me 2020 to 2022 so a
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
three-year Collective numbers and this
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire data there were 116
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle deaths or driver deaths of
 
04:29:41.450 --> 04:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
people who were unrestrained versus uh
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
47 deaths for drivers who were
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
restrained and if you look at the
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
passenger data there were 30 people
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
killed who are not wearing their
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
seatbelts and only 12 killed while
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
wearing their seatbelts so when I do
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
that math it equates to being over 50
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
percent increase in your mortality by
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
not wearing a seat belt so we've heard
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
all the benefits we've heard lots of
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
stories I had many points here that I
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
was going to use as counter arguments to
 
04:30:04.849 --> 04:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
all the other arguments that I've heard
 
04:30:06.130 --> 04:30:06.140 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to be repetitive or you
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
know redundant in the things that I've
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
said there's been pretty good evidence
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
about the financial costs of shared
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
amongst all of us I think that's true
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
I've I've had patients in our
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
Institution for months you know it's the
 
04:30:22.969 --> 04:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
deaths in some ways are easier if you're
 
04:30:24.530 --> 04:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
dead at the scene that is a personal
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
choice you've died that your family has
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
to pay the price for that the four-month
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
child old child of the first individual
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
that I declared dead that night 11 years
 
04:30:36.050 --> 04:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
ago he's still paying that price it's
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's the financial burden that is shared
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
amongst all of us and it's millions of
 
04:30:42.110 --> 04:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
dollars as was shared these these
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals may not have insurance they
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
not may not be as responsible as Mr
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
Richard in the back and have insurance
 
04:30:49.490 --> 04:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
and there are many people who are not
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
held accountable and that cost gets
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
shared amongst all of us and it's not
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
just the cost to have them survive it's
 
04:30:58.010 --> 04:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
the long-term care when they severe you
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
know severe traumatic brain injuries and
 
04:31:01.010 --> 04:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
they need full care the rest of their
 
04:31:02.809 --> 04:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
life and they go on disability so there
 
04:31:04.729 --> 04:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
are expenses that are shared amongst all
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
of us for many years that people don't
 
04:31:06.720 --> 04:31:08.510 align:start position:0%
of us for many years that people don't
appreciate

04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:31:10.370 --> 04:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
but on my drive here I started thinking
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
about how can I share the realities of
 
04:31:15.170 --> 04:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
Our Lives as medical providers and
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's the daily ins and outs and and
 
04:31:19.250 --> 04:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
Health Care is strained it's been
 
04:31:20.689 --> 04:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
strained but it's certainly worse now
 
04:31:22.849 --> 04:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
and Healthcare is triage and triage
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
starts with the sickest person and no
 
04:31:25.729 --> 04:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
matter what environment whether you're
 
04:31:27.410 --> 04:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
in the Ed waiting room or you're at the
 
04:31:29.330 --> 04:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
scene of an accident so if Mr Richard
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
crashes into you and a head-on collision
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
and is ejected from the vehicle he is
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
much more likely to be severely injured
 
04:31:36.110 --> 04:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
and you might be driving your car
 
04:31:38.689 --> 04:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
wearing your seatbelt but you may also
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
have some critical injuries that may not
 
04:31:43.250 --> 04:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
be as acutely apparent so the the first
 
04:31:44.450 --> 04:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
person who's going to go to the hospital
 
04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
is the one who's more injured so that
 
04:31:48.649 --> 04:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
might be most likely Mr Richard so
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
they're right there your your ability to
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
make a fair and equal Choice was taken
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
away from you because you don't come to
 
04:31:56.809 --> 04:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
the game with the same amount of
 
04:31:58.370 --> 04:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility you don't come to the
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
game with the same amount of expected
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
care because in Northern New Hampshire
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
there are limited resources limited
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
pre-hospital providers limited small
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals that have understaffed so when
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
they roll into the hospital everything
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
stops no matter what hospital you're at
 
04:32:14.809 --> 04:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
everything stops all the attention goes
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
to the sickest patient so if your loved
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
one is there for a heart attack or a
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
stroke or any other medical problem that
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
those two nurses and that one provider
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
in that institution are going to get
 
04:32:25.010 --> 04:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
shifted and you're going to be left
 
04:32:27.170 --> 04:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
alone it's a reality of the situation
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's a reality at our institution we're
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
a busy hospital we say no to people more
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
now than we ever have so if I have to
 
04:32:35.210 --> 04:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
say no to Colebrook that means they're
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to go four hours by ground
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
to you know Elliott or Portsmouth or
 
04:32:41.210 --> 04:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
some other large hospital so all of
 
04:32:43.370 --> 04:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
these decisions have Downstream effects
 
04:32:45.649 --> 04:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
that do affect all of us but we didn't
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
make the wrong choice we made the right
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
choice we were trying to be responsible
 
04:32:50.450 --> 04:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
we're trying to wear our seat belts we
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
try to do the right things but there are
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
costs to us when other people don't make
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
that same decision
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
it reminds me every day
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
04:33:13.849 --> 04:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
you know there are four parts to a
 
04:33:15.650 --> 04:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
trauma system there's the pre-hospital
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
providers who day and night are out
 
04:33:19.250 --> 04:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
there risking their lives there's a
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
hospital that take care of these people
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
when they arrive there's the rehab part
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
where people go to to try to get back to
 
04:33:26.330 --> 04:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
a normal sense of life and be productive
 
04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
members of society and there's injury
 
04:33:30.170 --> 04:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
prevention and yeah we do a lot of
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
education but you've heard how it's
 
04:33:33.529 --> 04:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
three parts and the one part that we
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
don't have is the legal part it's a
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
secondary bill
 
04:33:36.840 --> 04:33:38.029 align:start position:0%
secondary bill
it's

04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:33:40.131 --> 04:33:40.141 align:start position:0%
it's probably as far as a seatbelt bill
 
04:33:42.170 --> 04:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
goes I think probably the most benign
 
04:33:45.170 --> 04:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
but it will change it will change lives
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I I when I do the math looking at
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers over the five years I
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
estimate they're probably 50 to 100
 
04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
deaths that could have been prevented
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
over the last five years from the time I
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
last spoke so
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
04:34:03.289 --> 04:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
committee representative Sykes
 
04:34:06.051 --> 04:34:06.061 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you sir for
 
04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question you may not be the
 
04:34:09.650 --> 04:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
right person to ask you but we'll get
 
04:34:09.660 --> 04:34:10.849 align:start position:0%
right person to ask you but we'll get
started

04:34:10.849 --> 04:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
started
 
04:34:10.859 --> 04:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
started
um

04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:14.570 --> 04:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell most of the data
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
that we've been hearing today is the
 
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
numbers of
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
unvelted versus belted fatalities
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
do we keep data about belted versus
 
04:34:24.840 --> 04:34:26.929 align:start position:0%
do we keep data about belted versus
unbelted

04:34:26.929 --> 04:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
unbelted
 
04:34:29.330 --> 04:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
serious injuries
 
04:34:32.090 --> 04:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
we have a data of who's as far as
 
04:34:35.570 --> 04:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
injured yes belted and unbalted I think
 
04:34:37.849 --> 04:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
the data collected of
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
the severity of those injuries for from
 
04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire standpoint would be
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
difficult because we don't have a good
 
04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
Collective data repository but I think
 
04:34:47.330 --> 04:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
National Data will tell you that your
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
injury severity goes up when you're not
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
wearing a seatbelt and when you're
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
injected that's what I'm trying to get
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
to okay
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:35:01.730 --> 04:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:03.890 --> 04:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
so with that I have no other pink cards
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
so at this point I'll end the public
 
04:35:09.769 --> 04:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.209 --> 04:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:35:13.250 --> 04:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
that was getting the hot water here is
 
04:35:15.230 --> 04:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
it possible to ask
 
04:35:17.090 --> 04:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
the trooper another question that
 
04:35:19.010 --> 04:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:25.070 --> 04:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
sure since if he'd be so kind to come
 
04:35:25.080 --> 04:35:27.410 align:start position:0%
sure since if he'd be so kind to come
back

04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:27.420 --> 04:35:32.269 align:start position:0%
 
huh

04:35:32.269 --> 04:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate this representative
 
04:35:35.810 --> 04:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
Sinclair thank you
 
04:35:35.820 --> 04:35:36.890 align:start position:0%
Sinclair thank you
um

04:35:36.890 --> 04:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
sir I'm just curious here it says here
 
04:35:43.750 --> 04:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
in in the uh line 16 the position
 
04:35:46.010 --> 04:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
provisions of this section shall be
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
enforceable only as a secondary offense
 
04:35:50.810 --> 04:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
when the police officer detains the
 
04:35:53.449 --> 04:35:53.459 align:start position:0%
driver for a suspected violation
 
04:35:56.209 --> 04:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:35:59.689 --> 04:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
if they're not guilty of that suspected
 
04:35:59.699 --> 04:36:01.490 align:start position:0%
if they're not guilty of that suspected
offense

04:36:01.490 --> 04:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
offense
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
and they did not have their seatbelt on
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
would they then be able to give a ticket
 
04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
for the seat belt even though what they
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
originally start for did not constitute
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
I guess that would be an issue for the
 
04:36:15.410 --> 04:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
courts right so if if there was a
 
04:36:16.609 --> 04:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
summons issued for whatever the original
 
04:36:19.490 --> 04:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
violation was that will not mean that he
 
04:36:21.890 --> 04:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
or she will not have the right to
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
um could test that charge
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
and contest the seat belts in the same
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
direction the same way I think I know
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
what you're asking but
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
um no if I what I mean is let's say uh
 
04:36:37.330 --> 04:36:37.340 align:start position:0%
let's say my car touched the white line
 
04:36:40.730 --> 04:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
and the officer has probable cause I
 
04:36:42.289 --> 04:36:42.299 align:start position:0%
think perhaps this person is driving
 
04:36:45.410 --> 04:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence or something like
 
04:36:48.170 --> 04:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
that and is finds out that no none of
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
that applies but I'm not wearing a seat
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
belt would they then be able to give me
 
04:36:54.051 --> 04:36:54.061 align:start position:0%
a ticket for the seat belt although I'm
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
not charged with anything else yes if
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
they were if the stop was made for a
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
valid motor vehicle violation
 
04:37:02.929 --> 04:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
even though there was no motor vehicle
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
violation at the time other in other
 
04:37:08.330 --> 04:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
words I wasn't I wasn't drunk I wasn't
 
04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
driving impaired or anything like that
 
04:37:11.570 --> 04:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay you're good to go but you're not
 
04:37:12.890 --> 04:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
wearing a seatbelt so now I'm going to
 
04:37:14.209 --> 04:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
give you a ticket for that right but my
 
04:37:16.250 --> 04:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
guess is in your scenario the stop
 
04:37:17.631 --> 04:37:17.641 align:start position:0%
wasn't made because you were drunk the
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
stop was made because you went over the
 
04:37:20.449 --> 04:37:20.459 align:start position:0%
white line which is a totally separate
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
thing so if you're talking about the
 
04:37:24.650 --> 04:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
violation would still exist you just may
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
not be impaired in your scenario you
 
04:37:30.410 --> 04:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
could be stopped for speeding and you
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
stop for any vote any multitude of
 
04:37:34.730 --> 04:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
things right and you would have their if
 
04:37:36.890 --> 04:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
you were found if you were given a
 
04:37:38.029 --> 04:37:38.039 align:start position:0%
summons or you're arrested for the
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
original charge you'd have the
 
04:37:40.849 --> 04:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contest that at any point
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
in time okay thank you
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and this is along those same
 
04:37:50.449 --> 04:37:50.459 align:start position:0%
lines in in your opinion
 
04:37:53.570 --> 04:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
um is the bill a weaker bill because it
 
04:37:56.449 --> 04:37:56.459 align:start position:0%
is uh based on secondary offense rather
 
04:38:02.209 --> 04:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I don't know that I'm
 
04:38:05.390 --> 04:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
really in the position states weaker
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
what I would say is this uh I am for
 
04:38:08.400 --> 04:38:10.689 align:start position:0%
what I would say is this uh I am for
whatever

04:38:10.689 --> 04:38:10.699 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh requires people who wear seatbelts
 
04:38:17.090 --> 04:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
so if if it's enforceable after a
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
regular car stop and people will put
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
them on then
 
04:38:21.410 --> 04:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
um for that maybe people will put them
 
04:38:22.670 --> 04:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
on knowing if I get stopped for
 
04:38:24.289 --> 04:38:24.299 align:start position:0%
something else I'm going to have you
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to have to deal with the
 
04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
seat belt issue after I'm for whatever
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
makes people put seat belts on it this
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
is not at least I can speak only for
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
myself this is not an excuse to stop
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
cars and to write tickets this is about
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%

05:00:15.708 --> 05:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
I've never liked anything that had to do
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
with safety seats that dealt with ages
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
where children at that age or those ages
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
are all over the place as far as height
 
05:00:28.190 --> 05:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
and weight that seems to be making more
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
sense but I don't see anything in the
 
05:00:32.400 --> 05:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
sense but I don't see anything in the
bill

05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
that we should be concerned about for
 
05:00:38.930 --> 05:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
itlings so I would suggest that be the
 
05:00:38.940 --> 05:00:40.368 align:start position:0%
itlings so I would suggest that be the
motion

05:00:40.368 --> 05:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
