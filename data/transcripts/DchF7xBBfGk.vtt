00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:50.450 align:start position:0%
so we are going to take amendment House
 
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:56.990 align:start position:0%
bill 50 in 63 first on I wanted to make
 
00:12:59.680 --> 00:12:59.690 align:start position:0%
a short statement before we start which
 
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:04.670 align:start position:0%
is that I seem to have been derelict at
 
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.130 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this term in getting
 
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.170 align:start position:0%
people to understand that our committee
 
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
under the rules has a responsibility to
 
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
on on make sure that dedicated funds
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
that are being changed or dedicated
 
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
funds that are new on are working
 
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:28.460 align:start position:0%
appropriately are sourced appropriately
 
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.170 align:start position:0%
on are raising the right kind of money
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
for the job and vice versa on and on
 
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:42.230 align:start position:0%
this is why we spend a fair amount of
 
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
time on some things that you may think
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
are the policy of prior committee this
 
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
both of these bills actually fall into
 
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:53.590 align:start position:0%
this category
 
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:00.830 align:start position:0%
so represent bursting has a question or
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
a comment or both
 
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:14.740 align:start position:0%
and I won't want him to talk um could
 
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:20.860 align:start position:0%
you unmute madam chair this is a second
 
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:23.470 align:start position:0%
committee bill and I would just like you
 
00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
to refresh our memory on what that means
 
00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:28.689 align:start position:0%
to be a second committee bill and does
 
00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:30.939 align:start position:0%
that mean there are any boundaries on
 
00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:34.269 align:start position:0%
this discussion or is the breadth of the
 
00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:36.459 align:start position:0%
discussion limited to the dedicated fund
 
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:39.610 align:start position:0%
or we will or will we be revisiting
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
policy aspects of this bill that were
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
discussed by the prior committee
 
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:46.629 align:start position:0%
judiciary on their February 5th exact
 
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:51.790 align:start position:0%
session well if we are going to discuss
 
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:53.980 align:start position:0%
the amendment which I thought was most
 
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.170 align:start position:0%
of the reason for this work session on
 
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:01.420 align:start position:0%
the work session is changing the policy
 
00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:06.579 align:start position:0%
of the first committee so I think to
 
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
that extent we are going to have in the
 
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:13.300 align:start position:0%
sense that in our sense of a dedicated
 
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:18.670 align:start position:0%
fund which has to be be tailored to the
 
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:21.490 align:start position:0%
objective of the fund the objective has
 
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:25.660 align:start position:0%
to be clear and the the both the
 
00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:28.449 align:start position:0%
sourcing and the amount of money has to
 
00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:34.949 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to to that fund and in
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
removing this from governor and council
 
00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:40.779 align:start position:0%
which in the public hearing this
 
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.110 align:start position:0%
committee discussed was on not
 
00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
appropriate within the administrative
 
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:52.629 align:start position:0%
structure of the state and putting it
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:02.980 align:start position:0%
adjusting the subsection before the one
 
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:04.660 align:start position:0%
that was dealt with in the first
 
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:10.990 align:start position:0%
committee to mirror the section that was
 
00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:15.939 align:start position:0%
dealt with in that on we have
 
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:21.970 align:start position:0%
I have a new amendment which does deal
 
00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:23.949 align:start position:0%
with the policy of the first committee
 
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:27.789 align:start position:0%
and and change it somewhat from what it
 
00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:29.229 align:start position:0%
had been before particularly in the
 
00:16:32.129 --> 00:16:32.139 align:start position:0%
aspects of what a dedicated fund does
 
00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:38.229 align:start position:0%
and how it operates so on it is a little
 
00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:40.929 align:start position:0%
difficult to figure out the boundaries
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
on this one and an appropriate response
 
00:16:51.229 --> 00:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
could be simply to take the bill and
 
00:16:55.289 --> 00:16:55.299 align:start position:0%
either interim study or ITL it so that
 
00:16:58.679 --> 00:16:58.689 align:start position:0%
it can go back to the to the sponsor and
 
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:04.809 align:start position:0%
be submitted as as a clean bill -
 
00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:06.789 align:start position:0%
whichever committee is considered
 
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:08.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate next term because we may
 
00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:10.659 align:start position:0%
have different people deciding which
 
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:14.860 align:start position:0%
bills go where okay so it sounds to me
 
00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:16.419 align:start position:0%
like you're going to allow a lot a lot
 
00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:19.529 align:start position:0%
of latitude and well you don't know the
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
boundaries I think on one of the
 
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:35.350 align:start position:0%
objectives of the bill was to remove the
 
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:40.750 align:start position:0%
control from the AG's office - anywhere
 
00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:45.009 align:start position:0%
else and that was fairly clear in the
 
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:48.850 align:start position:0%
original on in the public hearing I
 
00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:54.269 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would not have a
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
discussion of what we learned in the
 
00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:04.149 align:start position:0%
public hearing on particularly if five
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
people are going to to do the same
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
discussion we do have the additional
 
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:16.570 align:start position:0%
problem that on the people who would
 
00:18:19.889 --> 00:18:19.899 align:start position:0%
have been opposed to the bill did not
 
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:21.970 align:start position:0%
notice the bill going through the first
 
00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:26.649 align:start position:0%
committee and are ready to appear right
 
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
now which is to try
 
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:32.150 align:start position:0%
late but this whole procedure is a
 
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.180 align:start position:0%
trifle late because not just a Kovac but
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
of the the lack of complete presentation
 
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:47.870 align:start position:0%
either in our public hearing or in the
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing apparently of the first
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
committee I understand it was only
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
represented by the AG's person who is
 
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:02.570 align:start position:0%
here in the audience I believe so you're
 
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:04.910 align:start position:0%
gonna allow testimony even though this
 
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:07.850 align:start position:0%
is a work session because the certain
 
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
parties were unaware of the first time
 
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
the bill was heard but can you extend
 
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:17.950 align:start position:0%
that courtesy to all parties oh yes on
 
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
the trouble is we you have a great
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
number of people in the audience that
 
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
would wish to talk I hope that they will
 
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:30.100 align:start position:0%
if they hear someone else saying
 
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:34.370 align:start position:0%
something that they will not feel that
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
they have to repeat it and I hope the
 
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.090 align:start position:0%
same would be true of the four people
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
that three or four people that seem to
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
be on the other side I'm not sure where
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
they all are right I have no idea if
 
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:51.650 align:start position:0%
they want to speak or not they're just
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
here to make themselves available to the
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee should they be it's alright as
 
00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:58.940 align:start position:0%
far as I know but perhaps some of them
 
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.270 align:start position:0%
want to speak yeah well it is difficult
 
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:09.260 align:start position:0%
in this format because on unless someone
 
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.350 align:start position:0%
inside the committee knows what they'd
 
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:16.910 align:start position:0%
have to offer on it we can't find out
 
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
until they've talked it goes
 
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:23.450 align:start position:0%
but I'm confident you will Shepherd us
 
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:24.740 align:start position:0%
to the promised land
 
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:36.530 align:start position:0%
I will try so I think the the amendment
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
came from represent Burstein and
 
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.210 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane representative
 
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:43.850 align:start position:0%
bursting is the one on the committee so
 
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.250 align:start position:0%
I think he ought to explain the
 
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:49.790 align:start position:0%
amendment I hope everybody has read it
 
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:52.850 align:start position:0%
they half the committee didn't get it
 
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.130 align:start position:0%
till recently thank you madam chair as
 
00:20:59.890 --> 00:20:59.900 align:start position:0%
we all know this is a second committee
 
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:03.890 align:start position:0%
bill the bill was originally in
 
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:05.900 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and then it came to
 
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:08.450 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house on February 19th
 
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.220 align:start position:0%
and passed 329 221 the motion was ought
 
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:16.310 align:start position:0%
to pass so it seems from that first vote
 
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.170 align:start position:0%
that there's a tremendous appetite from
 
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:20.990 align:start position:0%
the house for the spirit of this bill
 
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.380 align:start position:0%
and when ways and means again it's work
 
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:27.410 align:start position:0%
on the bill my notes showed that the
 
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.020 align:start position:0%
chair had some significant problems with
 
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:31.670 align:start position:0%
the bill regarding the technical
 
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:33.860 align:start position:0%
application of the bill not the spirit
 
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.410 align:start position:0%
of the bill but the implementation of it
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
so this amendment tried to address all
 
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:42.620 align:start position:0%
of that and I believe it did I just as
 
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.010 align:start position:0%
concise as I can be this money redirects
 
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:49.900 align:start position:0%
funds from the drug forfeiture fund to
 
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:52.750 align:start position:0%
you go towards treatment instead of
 
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
enforcement the sponsor of the bill and
 
00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:58.580 align:start position:0%
I were very careful to be as fair as we
 
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:00.770 align:start position:0%
can and depending on the situation it's
 
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:03.260 align:start position:0%
possible law enforcement could actually
 
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
receive bigger reimbursements than they
 
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:07.580 align:start position:0%
were receiving before but once they
 
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.490 align:start position:0%
reimburse for everything all
 
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expenses related to the
 
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:17.420 align:start position:0%
prosecution after that the money would
 
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
go towards drug treatment to be
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of HHS
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
thank you we did not in our public
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
hearing discussed the the removal from
 
00:22:49.419 --> 00:22:49.429 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the dedicated fund of on
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
a number of the mechanisms for drug
 
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.090 align:start position:0%
enforcement on that that are in the bill
 
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
and we did not do it because there was
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
nobody present who could talk to us
 
00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:14.549 align:start position:0%
about that on except on the gentleman
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Justice who did
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
not have at that time sheets that I
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
think we got afterwards about where
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
exactly the money was being spent at
 
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
different times and how much money which
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
is under $500,000 a year was going into
 
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.110 align:start position:0%
it and mr. Locke the attorney Locke from
 
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.210 align:start position:0%
the AG's office did provide this I
 
00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:53.789 align:start position:0%
believe it was after the commentary it's
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
been quite a while now so perhaps we
 
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:03.620 align:start position:0%
should start by having him talk about
 
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.100 align:start position:0%
where the money has been been going and
 
00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:11.909 align:start position:0%
how much of it we know that 10% of it
 
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.070 align:start position:0%
went to Health and Human Services but we
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
don't know where the rest of it was
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
going except through this represent me
 
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:28.710 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to interrupt you let you know
 
00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:30.029 align:start position:0%
that representative of Romney said his
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
hand up don't look to recognize him
 
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:36.809 align:start position:0%
first or the attorney I think we should
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
rip his phone recognizer up scent of a
 
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
bra me first because
 
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.010 align:start position:0%
and he's been talking with where the
 
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:49.790 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office I believe
 
00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
Sanford Bharani okay yep thank you rob
 
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.330 align:start position:0%
you get you're absolutely correct that
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
the bill that came to us was flawed not
 
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:02.810 align:start position:0%
necessarily always means kind of way but
 
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:05.550 align:start position:0%
it was going to direct the funds to the
 
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
governor and we heard from attorney
 
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.250 align:start position:0%
Fenella the governor's a prime attorney
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
that that they don't have they don't
 
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:15.390 align:start position:0%
have this question to spend that money
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
it has to go to an agency so then then
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that was in my last meeting then we
 
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.030 align:start position:0%
received this amendment and when I look
 
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
at the amendment and I do want others to
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
look at this when you go to the bottom
 
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:34.460 align:start position:0%
two the number two when the amendment
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
modifies women and it that's where it
 
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
gives the authority for the dispense for
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
the phone to the DHHS and takes it away
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General the only
 
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
problem is that when you look at the
 
00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:58.770 align:start position:0%
current statute when you look at Roman
 
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:03.390 align:start position:0%
two and three it still says that the
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
AG's office is is responsible for
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the governor and
 
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
Executive Council and that the attorney
 
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:17.850 align:start position:0%
general's office shall adopt rules so
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment as is is flawed
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
from my perspective so so just goes on
 
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.020 align:start position:0%
I think the amenities work adopt this
 
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:35.490 align:start position:0%
and we could talk about policy later on
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
but those are just some perturbations I
 
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
made and anybody else wants to react to
 
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:42.500 align:start position:0%
that or so the same thing that I saw
 
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
should raise your hand I guess for now
 
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:51.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mister I clarify we're talking
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mister I clarify we're talking
about

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.450 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:01.649 align:start position:0%
RSA 318 b-17 B which I had sent to the
 
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:06.450 align:start position:0%
entire committee and sections Roman 1
 
00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:12.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
and reports that's the top port the
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
bottom the sex decision
 
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.210 align:start position:0%
change was to amend RSA 318 being : 17
 
00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.070 align:start position:0%
Dead Sea and we read that the SD gives
 
00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:39.809 align:start position:0%
the DNA chaste responsibility for that
 
00:27:41.629 --> 00:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
fund takes it away from the Attorney
 
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.090 align:start position:0%
General which okay but it's it's silent
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
when it comes to woman two and three and
 
00:27:59.479 --> 00:27:59.489 align:start position:0%
they in the current statute where the AG
 
00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:04.529 align:start position:0%
is still responsible for reporting and
 
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:19.830 align:start position:0%
adopting rules right the whole
 
00:28:24.589 --> 00:28:24.599 align:start position:0%
forfeiture process right so I you know
 
00:28:26.989 --> 00:28:26.999 align:start position:0%
the options we have is just to do what
 
00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:28.529 align:start position:0%
you earlier said is to either I kill
 
00:28:35.239 --> 00:28:35.249 align:start position:0%
this bill or study it or devote at least
 
00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:37.259 align:start position:0%
as bill just amendments gonna have to be
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
fixed again and I guess at the end of
 
00:28:43.729 --> 00:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
our discussion here whether it's worth
 
00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:46.220 align:start position:0%
trying to fix this amendment or not
 
00:28:48.229 --> 00:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
everything that al me represent aims
 
00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:50.269 align:start position:0%
would like to be recognized I'm
 
00:28:55.489 --> 00:28:55.499 align:start position:0%
representative Eames yeah thank you
 
00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:57.979 align:start position:0%
I just I want to second what
 
00:28:59.989 --> 00:28:59.999 align:start position:0%
representative Romney has just pointed
 
00:29:01.579 --> 00:29:01.589 align:start position:0%
out that there's still technical
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill
 
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
as it would be amended by the proposed
 
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:10.410 align:start position:0%
amendment that he has pointed out there
 
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:13.770 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an issue there and I
 
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:17.850 align:start position:0%
also find myself puzzling over the fact
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
that the proposed amendment has two
 
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:25.710 align:start position:0%
agencies taking money out of the drug
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund with I think an unclear
 
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.170 align:start position:0%
line between the two if you look at the
 
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:38.370 align:start position:0%
new paragraph that's being introduced at
 
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:45.090 align:start position:0%
seventeen B a row and five the from the
 
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:47.670 align:start position:0%
funds available in the drug forfeiture
 
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:51.630 align:start position:0%
fund the Department of Justice job pay
 
00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the first subparagraph is basically
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
the expenses of the proceeding that
 
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
generates the fund so that's that's a in
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
effect that's saying that the the net
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
after expenses will be in the drug will
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
still be in the drug forfeiture fund
 
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:10.350 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
but the second item is is I think
 
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
open-ended it's reimburse all direct
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
costs incurred in the arrest and
 
00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:23.070 align:start position:0%
prosecution of a person that would be
 
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
any person for a criminal violation of
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
this chapter on a case-by-case basis so
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's an ongoing potential expense for
 
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
draw down by the Department of Justice
 
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
and well that activity is going on in
 
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.450 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice on the other
 
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:44.790 align:start position:0%
side with now the Department of Health
 
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:47.790 align:start position:0%
and Human Services enabled to draw this
 
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.210 align:start position:0%
phone any balance remaining in the drug
 
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.170 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund is administered by the
 
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
private Health and Human Services well
 
00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:58.770 align:start position:0%
what is that balance it's a dynamic
 
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.150 align:start position:0%
situation and with one agency and the
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
other agency both involved it seems to
 
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:15.510 align:start position:0%
me it's a recipe for trouble that's this
 
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
one those are my comments thank you
 
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:22.580 align:start position:0%
thank you on representative Southworth
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
has his hand up thank you
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
I want to echo the other concerns and in
 
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:32.750 align:start position:0%
terms of the discussion of the hearing
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're really shifting not
 
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.030 align:start position:0%
from the merits of the bill or you know
 
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.070 align:start position:0%
the good intentions so on things that
 
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:42.530 align:start position:0%
were voted before we really need to
 
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.010 align:start position:0%
decide is it ready for primetime is it
 
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.510 align:start position:0%
something that really be ready for a
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
June boat and I almost think we don't
 
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
have all the information we need to
 
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
decide that except that the more we talk
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
the more complicated it gets to improve
 
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:06.650 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you on I'd like to
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
point out also that the fund is supposed
 
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:13.430 align:start position:0%
to be administered in Health and Human
 
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.130 align:start position:0%
Services but on only the balance
 
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.030 align:start position:0%
remaining in the fund after DOJ has done
 
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:25.850 align:start position:0%
the expenditures allowed in the new
 
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:30.410 align:start position:0%
section one on are supposed to go to
 
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:36.250 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I don't I
 
00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
think does the does the committee want
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
to hear from the woman from Health and
 
00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:47.540 align:start position:0%
Human Services that is present in the
 
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
audience that has been following this
 
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:53.330 align:start position:0%
bill apparently it being raised in the
 
00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:57.140 align:start position:0%
answer thumbs up or thumbs down yes
 
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:01.340 align:start position:0%
thumbs up or thumbs down I don't think
 
00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
we've got thumbs here but raising your
 
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:12.820 align:start position:0%
hand we have at least we have two people
 
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
requesting that 3/4 there more of them
 
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.210 align:start position:0%
okay so I and I think that I didn't
 
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
beforehand that I didn't manage to get
 
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:29.810 align:start position:0%
my lists printed out as the people that
 
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:31.290 align:start position:0%
were in the audience
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
on Jen do you have the woman from the
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
heo Higgins her name it represent so
 
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.650 align:start position:0%
Higgins miss Oh Higgins if you could
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
raise your hand you'll pop up to the top
 
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:56.510 align:start position:0%
of the list for us it's just a long list
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
it is a very long list we saw earlier I
 
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:05.370 align:start position:0%
think this is the first time any of us
 
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:08.250 align:start position:0%
are having to deal with this kind of
 
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:14.850 align:start position:0%
complication in I don't see her now
 
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:16.950 align:start position:0%
unless she's one of the phone numbers I
 
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:20.490 align:start position:0%
think we saw her earlier and she's not
 
00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:30.929 align:start position:0%
there now okay so um representative Lang
 
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:35.419 align:start position:0%
has his hand physically up yes yes
 
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:39.650 align:start position:0%
represent of Lang if you could and
 
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.050 align:start position:0%
representative Romney has his hand up he
 
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:46.350 align:start position:0%
would know probably what's going on
 
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:49.410 align:start position:0%
we'll ask her first and represent Lang
 
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:52.820 align:start position:0%
if you can use the raise hand on
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
function in the panelists participants
 
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:01.650 align:start position:0%
on your I would have loved to do that
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
except that's not working for me I can't
 
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
raise my hand that's why I was doing
 
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
this okay
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
raise your hand is at the very bottom of
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the panelists list unless you are on a
 
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:17.490 align:start position:0%
Mac in which case it is under other down
 
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:19.250 align:start position:0%
there somehow
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you click participants I found it
 
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
ok great so I think that we will we will
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
ask rip senator from me first
 
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:36.570 align:start position:0%
Wow Jennifer o'higgins has reappeared oh
 
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:38.850 align:start position:0%
good raised her hand would you like to
 
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.319 --> 00:35:48.329 align:start position:0%
okay miss O'Hagan's you're on hi there
 
00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:50.369 align:start position:0%
this is Jennifer Oh Higgins I'm the
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
senior policy analyst for behavioral
 
00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
health and legislative liaison I was had
 
00:35:59.120 --> 00:35:59.130 align:start position:0%
called in since I don't have great
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
internet connection so then when you
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
called on me I had to relog into zoom so
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about that confusion so we
 
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.170 align:start position:0%
received the amendment yesterday so we
 
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:12.690 align:start position:0%
haven't really had time to do a whole
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal review at this point but I think
 
00:36:17.359 --> 00:36:17.369 align:start position:0%
that we have a little bit of confusion
 
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.010 align:start position:0%
between you know section 1 and section 2
 
00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:22.109 align:start position:0%
of the bill where it with the Department
 
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:23.790 align:start position:0%
of Justice currently administering the
 
00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:26.549 align:start position:0%
fund and the second piece of the bill
 
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.530 align:start position:0%
having you know the fund be administered
 
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.010 align:start position:0%
by DHHS I think there's there's
 
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:34.530 align:start position:0%
currently that 10-percent set-aside for
 
00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:37.950 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I don't know that we have the
 
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:41.190 align:start position:0%
expertise in the department to be able
 
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:44.430 align:start position:0%
to reimburse for costs incurred by
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
arrests and prosecutions I think that
 
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:49.470 align:start position:0%
that expertise does the live with the
 
00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:52.349 align:start position:0%
DOJ so I would you know send it off to
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
them for that question as far as
 
00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:56.670 align:start position:0%
administering and any funding around
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and recovery that
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
is where you know our expertise would
 
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:03.630 align:start position:0%
would come into play and if you have any
 
00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:06.059 align:start position:0%
questions for me I'm happy to try to
 
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.030 align:start position:0%
field them as best I can
 
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:11.630 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone who has
 
00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
questions mr. Higgins representives
 
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:23.910 align:start position:0%
Lange thank you so I I'm reading this
 
00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:26.069 align:start position:0%
the way I I'm reading it is that after a
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
forfeiture first the Department of
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
Justice pays its expenses under one in
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
two of subsection 5 they're responsible
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice is responsible
 
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:41.270 align:start position:0%
for allocating those funds and then
 
00:37:43.789 --> 00:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
anything that's left over at the end of
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year except for 10% so 90% of
 
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:49.290 align:start position:0%
whatever balance is left over is then
 
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.650 align:start position:0%
shifted to Health and Human Services for
 
00:37:54.859 --> 00:37:54.869 align:start position:0%
treatment is that who I'm reading this
 
00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.190 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe mr. Higgins can
 
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
answer that since they seem to have just
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment yesterday but the
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
balance yes the balance seems to shift
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
over that at that point but all of this
 
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:18.690 align:start position:0%
money is going into the drug forfeiture
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
fund and is going in from work by the
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
DOJ on before that shifts of the 10%
 
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:37.310 align:start position:0%
happens yet in section 2 it says that
 
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:42.650 align:start position:0%
the fund is going to in the Treasury is
 
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:45.750 align:start position:0%
going to be administered entire entirely
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Health and Human
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
Services so presumably the DOJ would
 
00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:55.650 align:start position:0%
have to report back for what seems to be
 
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:58.110 align:start position:0%
the majority of the money to the
 
00:38:59.600 --> 00:38:59.610 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:02.810 align:start position:0%
in order to get permission to spend it
 
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
and that seems a little unworkable to me
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
anyway Eames eager to contribute did you
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
put your handbag down you say okay I
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
think you're James has his hand up
 
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:36.510 align:start position:0%
apparently headed up earlier no I just
 
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:39.270 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to representative
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
Lange's points and just I think if you
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
look closely a new language
 
00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.250 align:start position:0%
subparagraphs one and two that the take
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
out from the fund is broader than what
 
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:03.620 align:start position:0%
you think it might be or what you
 
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:08.770 align:start position:0%
suggested it might be on first blush the
 
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:11.710 align:start position:0%
there's two paragraphs it's one is very
 
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:15.940 align:start position:0%
clear it's a reasonable cost of the the
 
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceeding to is broader than
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
the forfeiture proceeding it's all
 
00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:28.660 align:start position:0%
direct costs in the arrest and
 
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:31.420 align:start position:0%
prosecution of a person on a
 
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:33.490 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.450 align:start position:0%
so it's anticipating many cases
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
case-by-case reimbursement of costs
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing it's beyond the
 
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.020 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceeding if it said in
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
their reimburse all direct costs
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
incurred in the arrest and prosecution
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
of a person involved in the matter
 
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:00.700 align:start position:0%
referenced in subparagraph one it would
 
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:03.820 align:start position:0%
be contained by that particular case
 
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:05.350 align:start position:0%
where the money with there was
 
00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
generating them the money that's going
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
to the drug drug forfeiture fund but
 
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.010 align:start position:0%
it's not it's much broader that's my
 
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
point and that's a problem thank you on
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
Brooks and berstein has his hand up yeah
 
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:26.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's currently we're reimbursing for
 
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:32.380 align:start position:0%
this it isn't and that's what we're
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
doing right now representative Eames but
 
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:38.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a dynamic aspect of ongoing I
 
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:41.830 align:start position:0%
mean the money is not dispersed until
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
after everything is finished that's how
 
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.090 align:start position:0%
it's currently working this doesn't
 
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:50.890 align:start position:0%
change that so um while your point about
 
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:54.610 align:start position:0%
it being ongoing costs and the dinah
 
00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:57.700 align:start position:0%
sysm regarding that that's going on
 
00:41:59.970 --> 00:41:59.980 align:start position:0%
right now and they get and those
 
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:02.020 align:start position:0%
reimbursements made to law enforcement
 
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:05.620 align:start position:0%
for all out-of-pocket expenses this
 
00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't vary respond yes yeah the
 
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:16.030 align:start position:0%
problem in my trying to respond to that
 
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.130 align:start position:0%
gets to I think the problem that we're
 
00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
gets to I think the problem that we're
encountering

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:19.890 align:start position:0%
encountering
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have anybody
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
maybe this proceeding isn't well set up
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
to give us the full picture of how this
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
fund operates has operated is intended
 
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
to operate in the future we're digging
 
00:42:43.329 --> 00:42:43.339 align:start position:0%
into a policy in an activity area that
 
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:46.530 align:start position:0%
we're not expert in and I don't know
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
exactly how its operated in the past my
 
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:55.770 align:start position:0%
sense is that that these phrases they
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
weren't in subparagraphs before have
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
enabled the Department of Justice to
 
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:08.130 align:start position:0%
reimburse for proceedings that reach
 
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:10.170 align:start position:0%
beyond particular proceedings that
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually generate the funds but I don't
 
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:13.890 align:start position:0%
know that for a fact
 
00:43:18.289 --> 00:43:18.299 align:start position:0%
so one of the difficulties that I have
 
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:23.430 align:start position:0%
and why I leaned towards towards sending
 
00:43:28.039 --> 00:43:28.049 align:start position:0%
this bill back for reworking so that it
 
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:30.930 align:start position:0%
can be properly reviewed by a first
 
00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:34.829 align:start position:0%
committee is that that we're operating
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
on thin ice we don't really understand
 
00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:39.809 align:start position:0%
the full dimensions of this thing and we
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
can't thank you rips in and aims on
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
representing Brahmi
 
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:53.730 align:start position:0%
is next and then represented streams his
 
00:43:58.579 --> 00:43:58.589 align:start position:0%
point perhaps Shawn could add some some
 
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:00.329 align:start position:0%
information as to how the phone actually
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
works today I'd like to make sure we
 
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:10.410 align:start position:0%
hear from the chief Foskey from Bedford
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
who understands the police changed whom
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
they've been they've been studying this
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
for a couple of weeks so now so I think
 
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.510 align:start position:0%
they have some things they want to say
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
as well thank you thank you do I
 
00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:24.089 align:start position:0%
understand they received the amendment
 
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:28.230 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago so I provided it to
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.730 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago so I provided it to
them

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:29.740 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:34.210 align:start position:0%
what IQ and focuses our site didn't see
 
00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.339 --> 00:44:41.349 align:start position:0%
whenever you sent it out it got
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
forwarded on I didn't send it out until
 
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:50.530 align:start position:0%
extremely recently because I didn't
 
00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:53.609 align:start position:0%
receive it until extremely recently on
 
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
read perhaps on
 
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
I cannot remember his his name the
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
charlatan the police chief briefed on
 
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:18.910 align:start position:0%
skeet some ski thank you it is he
 
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:23.500 align:start position:0%
willing to speak for a minute is he on
 
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.010 align:start position:0%
this list yeah just a minute I wish
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
these lists were alphabetical its
 
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:33.820 align:start position:0%
alphabetical by first name which makes
 
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:35.980 align:start position:0%
it a little challenging he's raised his
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
hand for us thank you thank you so we
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
would like to he's he's on now an
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
episode the Sun ski I think yes good
 
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:52.990 align:start position:0%
morning can you hear me yes okay great
 
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:55.300 align:start position:0%
madam chair and members of the committee
 
00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:58.660 align:start position:0%
for giving the Chiefs of Police a few
 
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:02.380 align:start position:0%
moments to discuss this and I'll go
 
00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:05.190 align:start position:0%
directly to the core of your discussion
 
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:07.660 align:start position:0%
which I think I may be able to help you
 
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:12.790 align:start position:0%
with and and if I may in my own farm
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
background vernacular this is a chicken
 
00:46:18.089 --> 00:46:18.099 align:start position:0%
in the egg sort of discussion here with
 
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:21.310 align:start position:0%
respect to the source of these funds the
 
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.330 align:start position:0%
way that this bill is amended and likely
 
00:46:30.089 --> 00:46:30.099 align:start position:0%
to be administered by DHHS a non-law
 
00:46:32.609 --> 00:46:32.619 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency will eventually
 
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:34.930 align:start position:0%
result in the fund going to zero over
 
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:38.830 align:start position:0%
time and the reason why this assumption
 
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:41.410 align:start position:0%
is being made by the Chiefs is that the
 
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
funds in
 
00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:45.270 align:start position:0%
the drug asset forfeiture fund go
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
directly to support the investigations
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
that result in the seizures from drug
 
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:53.310 align:start position:0%
traffickers that replenish the fund and
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
over time when you siphon off funds for
 
00:46:59.360 --> 00:46:59.370 align:start position:0%
a non-law enforcement investigative
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
purpose eventually there will be less
 
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:03.230 align:start position:0%
funds available to conduct
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
investigations and they're at they're
 
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:06.870 align:start position:0%
for the source of the funds will
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
eventually dry up so as amended we
 
00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.070 align:start position:0%
believe that over time that this
 
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:15.500 align:start position:0%
administration readmit astray ssin of
 
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:18.570 align:start position:0%
what was originally intended to support
 
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:21.270 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking investigations and
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
shift the burden from the taxpayer to
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
the drug trafficker will eventually
 
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:29.780 align:start position:0%
result in the shifting back to the
 
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:32.370 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and that's why we are opposed
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
to it simply because it will eventually
 
00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:39.270 align:start position:0%
result in the dilution and the
 
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:41.070 align:start position:0%
elimination of the funds available to
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations and therefore no
 
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham had his hand
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
out still we had heard some testimony
 
00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
about how the existing funds are managed
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
I guess of the AG's office and most of
 
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
my what I saw was you know wasn't very
 
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
sophisticated accounting so the there
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
was significant portion of money that
 
00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
was kind of building up because it was
 
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:27.630 align:start position:0%
being held probably I believe you know
 
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:29.550 align:start position:0%
because it couldn't be released since
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
your final dispensation and the case
 
00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:34.590 align:start position:0%
might not have been heard yet so there
 
00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
was kind of more funds there then then
 
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:44.190 align:start position:0%
were active and and that's at such time
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
they felt that the disposition of a case
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
was final that's when the funds were
 
00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:52.539 align:start position:0%
being apportioned
 
00:48:59.130 --> 00:48:59.140 align:start position:0%
and back to police for those who brought
 
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:00.910 align:start position:0%
in the funds are presumably for
 
00:49:03.989 --> 00:49:03.999 align:start position:0%
additional investigative purposes or the
 
00:49:05.999 --> 00:49:06.009 align:start position:0%
other uses that were in there so I just
 
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:10.660 align:start position:0%
thought I would bring that bring that
 
00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
back in and follow up to representative
 
00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:19.419 align:start position:0%
Eames and our representative first in
 
00:49:23.579 --> 00:49:23.589 align:start position:0%
his comments thank you represent
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:24.419 align:start position:0%
his comments thank you represent
estrellas

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:24.429 align:start position:0%
estrellas
 
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:29.140 align:start position:0%
would that imply that who would think
 
00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:31.779 align:start position:0%
that a performance audit would be in
 
00:49:42.299 --> 00:49:42.309 align:start position:0%
order for this program ever since - no I
 
00:49:53.299 --> 00:49:53.309 align:start position:0%
would think so so are their
 
00:49:58.499 --> 00:49:58.509 align:start position:0%
representatives bursting did you have
 
00:50:00.509 --> 00:50:00.519 align:start position:0%
your hand up again or had it not gone
 
00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
down it's up thank you I think I want to
 
00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:08.859 align:start position:0%
just sort of power onto what
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham was saying and
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
I believe that one of the motivations
 
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:17.650 align:start position:0%
for the original bill was the lack of
 
00:50:21.569 --> 00:50:21.579 align:start position:0%
transparency as a matter of fact if
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
justice gives New Hampshire a d-minus
 
00:50:27.299 --> 00:50:27.309 align:start position:0%
ranking for forfeiture transparency and
 
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:29.650 align:start position:0%
accountability and I believe
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane the prime
 
00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:33.849 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill would like to speak
 
00:50:39.149 --> 00:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
more to that so I requested he'd be
 
00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:43.179 align:start position:0%
permitted to speak okay could we bring
 
00:50:49.099 --> 00:50:49.109 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.259 --> 00:50:52.269 align:start position:0%
I'm blanking on his first name so that
 
00:50:55.199 --> 00:50:55.209 align:start position:0%
we can find it unless he'll raise his
 
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
hand he's ready to go okay good
 
00:51:05.269 --> 00:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
Thank You members of the committee am I
 
00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:06.939 align:start position:0%
able to be heard right
 
00:51:11.399 --> 00:51:11.409 align:start position:0%
yes okay I want to thank you all for
 
00:51:13.229 --> 00:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak we
 
00:51:15.149 --> 00:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
have worked hard on this bill and I
 
00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
think as you could see with the previous
 
00:51:18.779 --> 00:51:18.789 align:start position:0%
vote on the House floor that it is
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
something that the goal is is achievable
 
00:51:24.929 --> 00:51:24.939 align:start position:0%
and something that a great many of the
 
00:51:28.019 --> 00:51:28.029 align:start position:0%
representatives want to see happen part
 
00:51:30.209 --> 00:51:30.219 align:start position:0%
of that is transparency because as we've
 
00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:33.309 align:start position:0%
seen there is ZERO accountability for
 
00:51:35.699 --> 00:51:35.709 align:start position:0%
any amount of the monies except for the
 
00:51:39.209 --> 00:51:39.219 align:start position:0%
10% that goes to thhs right now the rest
 
00:51:41.179 --> 00:51:41.189 align:start position:0%
of the money goes into a black hole
 
00:51:45.539 --> 00:51:45.549 align:start position:0%
where we are told that you know just
 
00:51:48.089 --> 00:51:48.099 align:start position:0%
trust us it's being used for further
 
00:51:50.459 --> 00:51:50.469 align:start position:0%
arrests I want to also point out that
 
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:55.650 align:start position:0%
the the insinuation that arrests and
 
00:51:58.169 --> 00:51:58.179 align:start position:0%
prosecution of drug trafficking will
 
00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:00.779 align:start position:0%
cease if they don't have this money is
 
00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:06.819 align:start position:0%
fallacious and the the mere insinuation
 
00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:08.439 align:start position:0%
that we would stop arresting people is
 
00:52:13.189 --> 00:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
really a ridiculous one in my opinion
 
00:52:16.799 --> 00:52:16.809 align:start position:0%
there is not going to be a halt to law
 
00:52:19.709 --> 00:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement prosecution and arrest of
 
00:52:23.459 --> 00:52:23.469 align:start position:0%
drug traffickers in the state it will
 
00:52:26.099 --> 00:52:26.109 align:start position:0%
not happen we will continue to arrest
 
00:52:30.149 --> 00:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
but we have a terrible problem with our
 
00:52:33.209 --> 00:52:33.219 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis we've lost 68 more people
 
00:52:36.769 --> 00:52:36.779 align:start position:0%
to the opioid crisis so far this year
 
00:52:43.919 --> 00:52:43.929 align:start position:0%
that's just this year in 2020 and we're
 
00:52:45.689 --> 00:52:45.699 align:start position:0%
going to continue seeing these numbers
 
00:52:48.689 --> 00:52:48.699 align:start position:0%
especially with this opioid crisis
 
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
converging with the the Kovich shutdown
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
we saw it during the Kovich shutdown
 
00:52:58.229 --> 00:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
that treatment programs were being
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
stopped that people were not they people
 
00:53:04.049 --> 00:53:04.059 align:start position:0%
who were working and trying to become
 
00:53:04.059 --> 00:53:04.649 align:start position:0%
who were working and trying to become
sober

00:53:04.649 --> 00:53:04.659 align:start position:0%
sober
 
00:53:08.099 --> 00:53:08.109 align:start position:0%
lost their jobs which pushed them back
 
00:53:12.239 --> 00:53:12.249 align:start position:0%
into isolation and desperation and turn
 
00:53:15.989 --> 00:53:15.999 align:start position:0%
them back to drugs this money can go
 
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:18.140 align:start position:0%
very far inmate
 
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:19.700 align:start position:0%
sure that we can continue providing
 
00:53:23.339 --> 00:53:23.349 align:start position:0%
services and it makes the person who
 
00:53:28.029 --> 00:53:28.039 align:start position:0%
victimized these people pay for their
 
00:53:30.849 --> 00:53:30.859 align:start position:0%
recovery it is taking the ill-gotten
 
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:34.750 align:start position:0%
gains from the drug trafficking and
 
00:53:37.809 --> 00:53:37.819 align:start position:0%
using it to restore people and to give
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
them hope and to change their lives
 
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:44.210 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that if there are any
 
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:46.490 align:start position:0%
minor details that we need to iron out
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
continue still going on with this this
 
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:51.650 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean we tried our best to
 
00:53:53.799 --> 00:53:53.809 align:start position:0%
address every issue that was brought up
 
00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:56.450 align:start position:0%
in the last public hearing that that you
 
00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:01.460 align:start position:0%
guys found but we are willing to
 
00:54:04.839 --> 00:54:04.849 align:start position:0%
continue working on this and clean it up
 
00:54:06.849 --> 00:54:06.859 align:start position:0%
in any way that you think is necessary
 
00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:08.569 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it passes muster
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
because the goal is achievable and it's
 
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:13.970 align:start position:0%
an it's a worthwhile goal to be able to
 
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.150 align:start position:0%
provide this money to those who need
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
help recovering from the drug
 
00:54:29.259 --> 00:54:29.269 align:start position:0%
traffickers okay thank you I would like
 
00:54:35.519 --> 00:54:35.529 align:start position:0%
to go to both mr. Locke Attorney lock on
 
00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:42.950 align:start position:0%
and to mr. Higgins again to ask how much
 
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:45.970 align:start position:0%
money they think we are talking about
 
00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:48.529 align:start position:0%
relative to the amount of money that is
 
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:53.380 align:start position:0%
going to that goal already elsewhere on
 
00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:00.349 align:start position:0%
but do we just moved his hand
 
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:02.210 align:start position:0%
representative about me do you want to
 
00:55:11.769 --> 00:55:11.779 align:start position:0%
say something first oh you just if you
 
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:15.460 align:start position:0%
don't mind so if more money is going to
 
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:18.500 align:start position:0%
treatment then where is the money coming
 
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.130 align:start position:0%
from to the
 
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:23.410 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the only other place if
 
00:55:26.519 --> 00:55:26.529 align:start position:0%
it's a zero-sum game play said that it
 
00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:27.849 align:start position:0%
comes from the taxpayers
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
whether it be property taxpayers or a
 
00:55:33.809 --> 00:55:33.819 align:start position:0%
state you know taxpayers can fund the
 
00:55:38.249 --> 00:55:38.259 align:start position:0%
enforcement port and that's where I'm
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's where I get confused because just
 
00:55:42.299 --> 00:55:42.309 align:start position:0%
saying you're doing this because you
 
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:43.900 align:start position:0%
want more money to go into Jordan
 
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:47.410 align:start position:0%
treatment but that's fine but what about
 
00:55:48.809 --> 00:55:48.819 align:start position:0%
where does the money come from
 
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.130 align:start position:0%
eventually we're gonna be paying that
 
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:52.569 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it sounds like they're going
 
00:55:55.499 --> 00:55:55.509 align:start position:0%
to be paying or for something here it
 
00:56:01.529 --> 00:56:01.539 align:start position:0%
was that correct we we already pay for
 
00:56:05.849 --> 00:56:05.859 align:start position:0%
drug enforcement this small amount when
 
00:56:07.799 --> 00:56:07.809 align:start position:0%
it comes to the overall size of the
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
police budget is almost nothing to them
 
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:16.210 align:start position:0%
we are not going to stop the law
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement just because this money is
 
00:56:23.099 --> 00:56:23.109 align:start position:0%
redirected this this is a twofold bill
 
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
it increases the transparency because it
 
00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:31.089 align:start position:0%
now gives a dedicated fund to that money
 
00:56:34.019 --> 00:56:34.029 align:start position:0%
that is drug forfeiture money from the
 
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.130 align:start position:0%
criminals and puts it under the spending
 
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:38.410 align:start position:0%
for those programs where it's
 
00:56:40.289 --> 00:56:40.299 align:start position:0%
accountable and we can see where it's
 
00:56:42.779 --> 00:56:42.789 align:start position:0%
going which will increase the
 
00:56:44.609 --> 00:56:44.619 align:start position:0%
transparency of this entire drug
 
00:56:49.999 --> 00:56:50.009 align:start position:0%
forfeiture process and on top of it the
 
00:56:54.569 --> 00:56:54.579 align:start position:0%
law enforcement budget is is not even
 
00:56:57.299 --> 00:56:57.309 align:start position:0%
going to decrease by a hundredth of a
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
percent because of this it's ridiculous
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
to think that that this small amount is
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
making a dent at all in what we've
 
00:57:05.779 --> 00:57:05.789 align:start position:0%
already paid funding for law enforcement
 
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:07.990 align:start position:0%
law enforcement activities are going to
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
continue to go on we have federal grant
 
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:13.210 align:start position:0%
money that we use continually for drug
 
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:15.730 align:start position:0%
enforcement that the federal authorities
 
00:57:17.579 --> 00:57:17.589 align:start position:0%
are involved in it and when they get
 
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:19.150 align:start position:0%
involved with the drug forfeiture they
 
00:57:20.579 --> 00:57:20.589 align:start position:0%
get their bite of our money as well
 
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:22.450 align:start position:0%
before they take before we get to take
 
00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:26.829 align:start position:0%
our portion so this is not a situation
 
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:29.380 align:start position:0%
that's going to shift taxpayer money
 
00:57:32.039 --> 00:57:32.049 align:start position:0%
suddenly to increase the police budget
 
00:57:33.539 --> 00:57:33.549 align:start position:0%
the police already have their budget and
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
they are already
 
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:38.490 align:start position:0%
using that money to arrest people and
 
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:40.690 align:start position:0%
convict them and that's not going to
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
stop but these facilities need it we
 
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:49.030 align:start position:0%
just lost last year our only youth
 
00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:50.500 align:start position:0%
residential facility in New Hampshire
 
00:57:55.799 --> 00:57:55.809 align:start position:0%
for treatment it shut down and we don't
 
00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:57.130 align:start position:0%
have another one right now
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
and mrs. Johnston who lost her son last
 
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving is is on the phone
 
00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:06.250 align:start position:0%
listening as well and she had to send
 
00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:09.369 align:start position:0%
her son to California for residential
 
00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:12.069 align:start position:0%
treatment do we want to be the state
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
that has to export our children with
 
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:18.250 align:start position:0%
drug abuse problems so that they can
 
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
have treatment or do we want to be able
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
to take care of our children and make
 
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:27.130 align:start position:0%
them whole again Thank You
 
00:58:30.079 --> 00:58:30.089 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane I have
 
00:58:33.329 --> 00:58:33.339 align:start position:0%
representatives hands I want to
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
interrupt this and introduce some facts
 
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:43.510 align:start position:0%
to this I would like to listen to MS
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
O'Higgins talk about how much money I
 
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:50.290 align:start position:0%
hope she has this it doesn't have to be
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
precise how much money is being spent on
 
00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:56.140 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis right now by the state
 
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:02.650 align:start position:0%
and then on on attorney Rock talk about
 
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:08.250 align:start position:0%
how much money would be left after the
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable expenses of forfeiture
 
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:12.970 align:start position:0%
proceedings and reimbursement of all
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
direct costs in the rest and protection
 
00:59:23.609 --> 00:59:23.619 align:start position:0%
so could we call again on news O'Hagan's
 
00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:30.869 align:start position:0%
would she be willing to come up Jenny oh
 
00:59:34.859 --> 00:59:34.869 align:start position:0%
yeah she's label - hi there I would have
 
00:59:38.039 --> 00:59:38.049 align:start position:0%
to get back to you on which portions are
 
00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:40.750 align:start position:0%
state license verses our grants and
 
00:59:42.299 --> 00:59:42.309 align:start position:0%
pieces like that so I wouldn't be able
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:51.940 align:start position:0%
here what part of it is grants and what
 
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:56.380 align:start position:0%
part of it is is state money the
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
question is how much is the state
 
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:04.180 align:start position:0%
spending right now I'm not sure I'd have
 
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:07.450 align:start position:0%
to get back to you okay you don't have
 
01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:10.750 align:start position:0%
any idea whether it's millions tens of
 
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:23.290 align:start position:0%
millions or 250 thousand dollars I'm
 
01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:26.740 align:start position:0%
sorry then muted and unmuted back and
 
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
forth we I mean we have several large
 
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:33.700 align:start position:0%
grants including a block a block grant
 
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.010 align:start position:0%
as well as the state opioid response
 
01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
grant currently that you know is fifty
 
01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:40.780 align:start position:0%
five million dollars so nope it's not
 
01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:43.870 align:start position:0%
two hundred fifty thousand but you know
 
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:45.700 align:start position:0%
again we I would have to just like break
 
01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:47.710 align:start position:0%
out those investments based on what your
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
what information you're looking for
 
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:54.310 align:start position:0%
thank you but it's it's in the tens of
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
millions thank you yes okay
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
attorney Locke could could you get on
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
and talk to us about roughly how much
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
money is left over after you pay for the
 
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:19.870 align:start position:0%
items that are in section one the
 
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:22.630 align:start position:0%
reasonable expenses of forfeiture
 
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:28.210 align:start position:0%
proceedings and the reimbursement of
 
01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.110 align:start position:0%
sure I'm happy to kind of talk a little
 
01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:42.430 align:start position:0%
bit about that unfortunately I can't
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
give you concrete because of obviously
 
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:47.770 align:start position:0%
from year to year based on the number of
 
01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:49.870 align:start position:0%
forfeitures we do but the the value of
 
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
the different forfeit but also it's
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:53.770 align:start position:0%
going to depend a little bit on how this
 
01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:57.130 align:start position:0%
gets construed if it gets construed as
 
01:01:59.490 --> 01:01:59.500 align:start position:0%
you get reimbursed kind of as the
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is done so for example if we
 
01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:04.849 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of $2,000 and that money can
 
01:02:06.579 --> 01:02:06.589 align:start position:0%
only be used to reimburse the
 
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:08.690 align:start position:0%
investigation that led seizure of that
 
01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:11.809 align:start position:0%
$2,000 that is going to probably see a
 
01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:15.049 align:start position:0%
far less false far amount of money make
 
01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:17.329 align:start position:0%
its way to digest
 
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:20.930 align:start position:0%
then if the forfeiture were whether we
 
01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:21.980 align:start position:0%
could take all the forfeitures and
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
aggregate and reimburse costs the issues
 
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:29.690 align:start position:0%
here of some of the and some of the
 
01:02:31.779 --> 01:02:31.789 align:start position:0%
other issues that tie into this in terms
 
01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:33.410 align:start position:0%
of reimbursement and relying upon
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is the fact that from
 
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:39.410 align:start position:0%
seizure of the funds to confine all
 
01:02:41.559 --> 01:02:41.569 align:start position:0%
disposition of the forfeiture proceeding
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
that can take months if not years the
 
01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
complete and that is a required aspect
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
before a forfeiture can be completed and
 
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:52.250 align:start position:0%
the doctor receives those funds is that
 
01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:53.690 align:start position:0%
there has to be a conviction and then
 
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:56.980 align:start position:0%
the forfeiture proceeding was all and so
 
01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:00.019 align:start position:0%
there isn't you know there isn't kind of
 
01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:01.670 align:start position:0%
this that there's going to need to be
 
01:03:04.089 --> 01:03:04.099 align:start position:0%
essentially if before that reimbursement
 
01:03:06.279 --> 01:03:06.289 align:start position:0%
can occur that money is being put
 
01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:09.829 align:start position:0%
forward by taxes at that point I mean if
 
01:03:12.609 --> 01:03:12.619 align:start position:0%
there's no other funds abroad and I
 
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:14.150 align:start position:0%
really hope you can hear me because if
 
01:03:18.759 --> 01:03:18.769 align:start position:0%
you almost stop moving oh we can hear
 
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
you yes you can still talk could you
 
01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:28.910 align:start position:0%
could you just give a rough estimate of
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
what proportion of the $500,000 is
 
01:03:36.809 --> 01:03:36.819 align:start position:0%
actually under $500,000 but I comes in
 
01:03:42.339 --> 01:03:42.349 align:start position:0%
to this drug forfeiture fund that would
 
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
be available to go out after the
 
01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:52.609 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and direct costs I I don't
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
know if I could give you a good estimate
 
01:03:55.839 --> 01:03:55.849 align:start position:0%
of that honestly I worked I spoke with
 
01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:58.130 align:start position:0%
our director of administration of that
 
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:00.500 align:start position:0%
would look like and it just it's such a
 
01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:02.450 align:start position:0%
fundamental change to the model we'd
 
01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:04.309 align:start position:0%
have to account for kind of all the
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
hours that are putting into just doing
 
01:04:10.299 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
forfeitures on our end let alone the ten
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
County Attorneys offices hunt police
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
departments that do this work across the
 
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
Dave we don't those numbers we just
 
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:19.140 align:start position:0%
don't have access to to make that
 
01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:23.790 align:start position:0%
determination on their end would you say
 
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.010 align:start position:0%
that that at most half of the money
 
01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:31.350 align:start position:0%
available in that fund would be able to
 
01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
to go on to to determination by the
 
01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:45.150 align:start position:0%
did you say that most half I would be on
 
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:46.650 align:start position:0%
the generous end I think after the
 
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursements there would not be a
 
01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:50.490 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money left to go
 
01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so now I think we can go back
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
there are four hands under panelists the
 
01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:08.070 align:start position:0%
first students were upset over he he's
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
had his hand up the number for quite a
 
01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
while very faint if you could speak up
 
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.130 align:start position:0%
representative O'Leary okay I put this
 
01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
brand new talk with my chief he needs
 
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:53.130 align:start position:0%
the money from this and route 111
 
01:05:57.290 --> 01:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
through Hudson it's a corridor they did
 
01:05:59.780 --> 01:05:59.790 align:start position:0%
a study on stops and there's a guy here
 
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:02.610 align:start position:0%
in town even when as far as suing the
 
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:05.450 align:start position:0%
police department only to find out that
 
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:09.330 align:start position:0%
the number of people stopped to a quote
 
01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:11.970 align:start position:0%
both Hispanic were actually carrying
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
drugs because they had masked plates
 
01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
they were coming up from Lawrence the
 
01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
issue is not whether or not we need drug
 
01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement money as Jim representative
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
explained had said the issue is
 
01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
what accounting takes place I don't want
 
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
to attack the attorney general's office
 
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:37.170 align:start position:0%
but attorney Locke just said we just
 
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:39.630 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers or the question
 
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:42.210 align:start position:0%
is who is keeping track of the numbers
 
01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
what is happening where is the money
 
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.109 align:start position:0%
what is happening where is the money
going

01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:52.820 align:start position:0%
not to individual CEO and our CEOs but
 
01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
informing witnesses or or for behind
 
01:07:01.099 --> 01:07:01.109 align:start position:0%
this apartment at this location for a
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
drug Buy I don't care about that I just
 
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:07.290 align:start position:0%
want the general categories out where
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
they can be seen in public and people
 
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
know that this money isn't a slush fund
 
01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
for the AG and for the police
 
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:19.940 align:start position:0%
departments they need the money but as
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
the vote house showed no one knows where
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
this money is it's a big black hole and
 
01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:29.849 align:start position:0%
in other states have reflected
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
negatively upon the good work in New
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of their behavior so
 
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:38.010 align:start position:0%
we need to get this right and I would
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that we retain this
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
and get it right so that we can push it
 
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:54.170 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
Romy what's next a fund in excess of a
 
01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:14.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the general fund that
 
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
goes away with this because it's under
 
01:08:26.599 --> 01:08:26.609 align:start position:0%
the same section as as section 17 C so
 
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's one one thought the other one is
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to hear from I guess
 
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:34.710 align:start position:0%
there's two issues outstanding there's
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
concern about transparency
 
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
that the what does what does the AG's
 
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:43.770 align:start position:0%
office Shimano Hurlock do in terms of
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
reporting annually to the governor and
 
01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
the Executive Council I mean what is
 
01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:51.370 align:start position:0%
present to them in number one and number
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
two for representative on the prime
 
01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:06.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor and and for was in Aberdeen
 
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's a contradiction in what's being
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
said because rigs are postings that
 
01:09:17.579 --> 01:09:17.589 align:start position:0%
actually the police enforcement officers
 
01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:20.980 align:start position:0%
would get more funds from this amendment
 
01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:24.819 align:start position:0%
and but the prime sponsor is arguing
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
that they're getting too much and that
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
we need more to go to the to the
 
01:09:32.849 --> 01:09:32.859 align:start position:0%
treatment so I'm not quite sure what it
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
is which way I need I need represents
 
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
blame to try to react to that and
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
perhaps Shawn law can react to my first
 
01:09:49.530 --> 01:09:49.540 align:start position:0%
comment well I mean would you like me to
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Lane first okay
 
01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:58.270 align:start position:0%
we cannot spend the whole two hours on
 
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:02.410 align:start position:0%
this thank you madam chair thank you yes
 
01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:04.570 align:start position:0%
with a question representative of Romney
 
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think that the way I heard
 
01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:09.670 align:start position:0%
representative Burstein comment he was
 
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:11.470 align:start position:0%
saying it is possible that a police
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
department could get more under the new
 
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:19.660 align:start position:0%
way of doing this and that is because we
 
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:21.610 align:start position:0%
are actually taking into account their
 
01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:23.470 align:start position:0%
actual reimbursement for their costs
 
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:27.550 align:start position:0%
that they've expended rather than just
 
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:31.950 align:start position:0%
giving them a lump sum or a disbursement
 
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:36.210 align:start position:0%
in general so yes there's there's
 
01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:39.150 align:start position:0%
because we also take that out first
 
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:41.980 align:start position:0%
there's a chance that not that DHHS
 
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:44.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't get much but on those large drug
 
01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
busts and those large confiscations once
 
01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:50.030 align:start position:0%
the conviction is made and
 
01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:52.490 align:start position:0%
we reimburse all the expenses incurred
 
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:54.620 align:start position:0%
through the arrests in the trial
 
01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:57.980 align:start position:0%
DHHS will get some money and no it's not
 
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:00.260 align:start position:0%
a dependable amount but every bit that
 
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
we can give to some of these treatment
 
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:10.730 align:start position:0%
facilities helps thank you I want to
 
01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:12.980 align:start position:0%
recognize rips and in flying and then
 
01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:15.860 align:start position:0%
represent Burstein and then represented
 
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:19.780 align:start position:0%
southwards and then I want to call on
 
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
Chris Shea with a question thank you
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:27.890 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is I'm a little
 
01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:30.110 align:start position:0%
confused by the conversation that it
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
will cost taxpayers money because in the
 
01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
amendment at least it reimburses all the
 
01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:38.090 align:start position:0%
cost of an investigation back to the law
 
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:41.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency for the seizure so I
 
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:44.540 align:start position:0%
don't see a taxpayer paying a fee here
 
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:46.010 align:start position:0%
that they're not already paying so
 
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:47.450 align:start position:0%
they're getting the same reimbursement I
 
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.050 align:start position:0%
think the issue at hand is that under
 
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:55.810 align:start position:0%
the current law 45% of the funds are
 
01:11:59.280 --> 01:11:59.290 align:start position:0%
returned to the arresting agency
 
01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:02.450 align:start position:0%
responsible for the seizure and yet
 
01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:04.310 align:start position:0%
there's no direct correlation that 45%
 
01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:06.050 align:start position:0%
was relative to their cost that could
 
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:07.790 align:start position:0%
have cost them more than 45% of the
 
01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
seizure could have cost some less than
 
01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:11.630 align:start position:0%
45% of the season I think what this bill
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment is trying to do is to not
 
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:17.470 align:start position:0%
make this worse is to make sure that
 
01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:19.790 align:start position:0%
agencies get the appropriate amount of
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
money if it's more than 45% they'll get
 
01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
more than 45% if it's less than 45% then
 
01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:27.230 align:start position:0%
no recoup their costs and not create a
 
01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:30.470 align:start position:0%
fund to to start doing other
 
01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
investigations that may or may not be
 
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:34.970 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I think it's really for
 
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:36.710 align:start position:0%
the eight for the prosecutions that are
 
01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:38.540 align:start position:0%
necessary that result in forfeiture and
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then sending the rest of the money
 
01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:42.980 align:start position:0%
over to treatment where it belongs so I
 
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:46.100 align:start position:0%
guess I'm unless I'm reading that wrong
 
01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:48.260 align:start position:0%
I don't see an expense going backs to
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer for these events that in
 
01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:52.730 align:start position:0%
fact the agencies are being reimbursed
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
for the actual cost and not just an
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary 45% number that isn't relative
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
to their costs at all now yes I wanna
 
01:13:05.379 --> 01:13:05.389 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it's in the eye of
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
whoever is doing the accounting of this
 
01:13:18.109 --> 01:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
but represented Burstein thank you let
 
01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:20.130 align:start position:0%
me address what representative of Romney
 
01:13:22.879 --> 01:13:22.889 align:start position:0%
said about we struck the million dollars
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
out of that any money in excess that
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
would go to the general fund
 
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:28.650 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the past four years
 
01:13:31.459 --> 01:13:31.469 align:start position:0%
how much money came in and we've never
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
even approached a million dollars I
 
01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
think that the most we did was in fiscal
 
01:13:40.129 --> 01:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
2018 where we took in a little more than
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars other than that
 
01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:45.150 align:start position:0%
the years I'm looking at around two
 
01:13:47.359 --> 01:13:47.369 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand for two years and three
 
01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:50.250 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty seven thousand for one
 
01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:52.110 align:start position:0%
of the other years of that money
 
01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:57.630 align:start position:0%
DHHS got 36 for 2019 DHHS got thirty six
 
01:14:00.379 --> 01:14:00.389 align:start position:0%
thousand DOJ got one hundred and sixty
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
nine thousand and a local police and
 
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:05.250 align:start position:0%
state police got one hundred and sixty
 
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:07.770 align:start position:0%
one thousand but we're not trying to cut
 
01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:09.389 align:start position:0%
anybody's budget here
 
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.090 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that introduction
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
should not be funded this this way they
 
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
go through a budget process like every
 
01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:21.690 align:start position:0%
other agency we're just trying to steer
 
01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:25.770 align:start position:0%
more money towards DHHS in some cases
 
01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:28.590 align:start position:0%
and and as we crafted this amendment
 
01:14:30.439 --> 01:14:30.449 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane and I were well
 
01:14:32.479 --> 01:14:32.489 align:start position:0%
aware of this there can be some cases
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
where law enforcement will get a bigger
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
reimbursement than they got before they
 
01:14:40.129 --> 01:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
should get if they have out-of-pocket
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
expenses by all means they should be
 
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:46.730 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for those the bill and I
 
01:14:49.399 --> 01:14:49.409 align:start position:0%
believe everyone on this call voted yes
 
01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
the first time around that doesn't bind
 
01:14:53.959 --> 01:14:53.969 align:start position:0%
you the second time around but I'm under
 
01:14:56.109 --> 01:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
the impression that there's an appetite
 
01:14:59.779 --> 01:14:59.789 align:start position:0%
for this to get more funding towards
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
treatment if that's if your opinion is
 
01:15:05.569 --> 01:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
changed on that I'd love to know that
 
01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:07.969 align:start position:0%
but I'm operating under the premise that
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
100% of the Ways and Means Committee
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
supported this the first time and that's
 
01:15:13.549 --> 01:15:13.559 align:start position:0%
why I'm working so hard to try and
 
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:24.270 align:start position:0%
I don't believe very many of us had read
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
the bill originally so on the first
 
01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:32.970 align:start position:0%
committee vote is yes always something
 
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:34.890 align:start position:0%
that we have to take a look at when we
 
01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
do see the bill but on South Worth was
 
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
next and then I do want to ask Chris Jay
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
to talk to us as well thank you thank
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
you madam chair am I on now yes
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
again thank you I want to echo the
 
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:56.180 align:start position:0%
comments of my usual seatmate
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative you Larry I'm just
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
wondering at what point it would be in
 
01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
order to do a straw vote for those who
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
are interested in retraining this bill
 
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
have difficulty in figuring out it just
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
occurred to me last night that we might
 
01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
want to do straw votes I don't think
 
01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to do straw votes are we
 
01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
Jim I don't know that you're not allowed
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
per se especially since it's not an
 
01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.050 align:start position:0%
official vote by any means and you're
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
making clear that it's a straw vote
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the best way that you would
 
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:40.710 align:start position:0%
want to approach that since you
 
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
generally just do a raising of hands you
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
could probably tried to do that
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
virtually if you want to do and we can't
 
01:16:59.360 --> 01:16:59.370 align:start position:0%
see everybody function yeah okay before
 
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:02.010 align:start position:0%
we do Oh representative will ascend
 
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:04.310 align:start position:0%
stand up earlier and it's back
 
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:07.530 align:start position:0%
representative will Griffith excuse me
 
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:10.530 align:start position:0%
well it's okay I'm curious if we can use
 
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:13.530 align:start position:0%
the poll function through zoom to do
 
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:15.450 align:start position:0%
something like that I don't think that
 
01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:18.140 align:start position:0%
we have that available in this yeah okay
 
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:24.210 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:30.630 align:start position:0%
and we need to I I want us to listen to
 
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:36.010 align:start position:0%
Christopher Chris Shea from El Bao and
 
01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:38.890 align:start position:0%
he is not from the audit division I
 
01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
can't remember whether he has ever been
 
01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:43.540 align:start position:0%
on the audience division but whether he
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
thinks that a performance audit of the
 
01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:53.250 align:start position:0%
accounting by DOJ for this program is
 
01:17:58.980 --> 01:17:58.990 align:start position:0%
something that could be done and he may
 
01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:01.330 align:start position:0%
not want to apply on whether it would be
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
useful or not
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
I represent mommy I heard the question
 
01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:08.290 align:start position:0%
and yes I did work on the audit division
 
01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:11.890 align:start position:0%
for on the performance ten years you
 
01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:14.710 align:start position:0%
could do a performance audit as part of
 
01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
a performance audit they would look at
 
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:17.910 align:start position:0%
the finances but what they would be
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
probably focused on and I say probably
 
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:23.170 align:start position:0%
because performance audits go through
 
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:26.170 align:start position:0%
the joint committee so they would give
 
01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:27.820 align:start position:0%
the charge to the performance audit over
 
01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:28.870 align:start position:0%
the performance audit oversight
 
01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:31.030 align:start position:0%
committee would give the charge to our
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
owners as to what they would like
 
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:34.510 align:start position:0%
addressed if you're looking at
 
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:36.970 align:start position:0%
efficiencies or effectiveness of how the
 
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
monies being spent or if it's being
 
01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:41.860 align:start position:0%
spent in the place was that the
 
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
legislature thought it was going based
 
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:45.490 align:start position:0%
on the way the statutes are written and
 
01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something a performance
 
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:48.850 align:start position:0%
thought it could look at if you're more
 
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:52.630 align:start position:0%
interested in accounting for did money
 
01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
go to the right agencies in the right
 
01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:57.580 align:start position:0%
amounts that might be a financial audit
 
01:18:59.730 --> 01:18:59.740 align:start position:0%
but a performance thought it could look
 
01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
at that as well and a performance audit
 
01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:07.780 align:start position:0%
could look and on whether the accounting
 
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:10.300 align:start position:0%
was broken down in sufficient detail to
 
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:12.370 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out whether it was
 
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:15.310 align:start position:0%
doing what the legislature wanted that's
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
doing what the legislature wanted that's
correct

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:15.850 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:17.410 align:start position:0%
yeah the performance audits was they
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
would do that as part of a performance
 
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:20.530 align:start position:0%
audit they would look at the money
 
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:22.570 align:start position:0%
that's been appropriated to a program
 
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:24.340 align:start position:0%
that's being audited and is it being
 
01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
spent the correct way it's just not a
 
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
financial audit it's just more of a you
 
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:32.890 align:start position:0%
a but the audit has the ability to bring
 
01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:35.170 align:start position:0%
financial auditors in if nests excuse me
 
01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
if necessary if they wanted
 
01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:41.950 align:start position:0%
more of a financial audit that they
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
could you know include as part of an
 
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:47.290 align:start position:0%
performance audit but I think it
 
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:50.130 align:start position:0%
depending on the scope of the question
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
definitely a performance audit could be
 
01:19:55.050 --> 01:19:55.060 align:start position:0%
done and it might be useful in terms of
 
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:56.370 align:start position:0%
just understanding whether this
 
01:19:59.130 --> 01:19:59.140 align:start position:0%
particular fund is paying for the
 
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:01.300 align:start position:0%
programs that it was intended to pay for
 
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
and achieving the results that were
 
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:07.930 align:start position:0%
expected and then just making sure the
 
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:09.130 align:start position:0%
money goes to the right buckets
 
01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:11.310 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps with the question
 
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:15.070 align:start position:0%
thank you and the last question for that
 
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:18.340 align:start position:0%
is on hence the Department of Justice
 
01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
had a performance audit ever is this
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
allowed vomits ought to be done of the
 
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice yes oh yeah yep so
 
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
I mean the depending on the type of
 
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:39.220 align:start position:0%
audit I mean that the type of them from
 
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:42.460 align:start position:0%
can we look at you know would be kept
 
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:45.070 align:start position:0%
confidential right so we wouldn't be
 
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:47.260 align:start position:0%
painting an audit you never see names
 
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:51.310 align:start position:0%
and an audit we try to generalize you
 
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:52.660 align:start position:0%
know that the agency that was
 
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:54.070 align:start position:0%
responsible for a particular function
 
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:56.170 align:start position:0%
that they do the job they were asked to
 
01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:58.930 align:start position:0%
do and what results did you see from
 
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.210 align:start position:0%
that so there so that would be kind of a
 
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
general focus of a performance on it but
 
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:06.550 align:start position:0%
yeah we in terms of this where it's a
 
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
fund he would be basically looking at
 
01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:10.650 align:start position:0%
probably several different agencies that
 
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:13.180 align:start position:0%
get the money from the fund right cuz
 
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:14.650 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services gets a piece
 
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:17.500 align:start position:0%
of this you'd be looking at you know is
 
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:19.870 align:start position:0%
the accounting done by the Attorney
 
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:22.510 align:start position:0%
General correct in terms of how much
 
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
percent goes to each bucket and then
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
following each of the buckets to see
 
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:27.580 align:start position:0%
that that money spent the way that it
 
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:30.700 align:start position:0%
was intended but yes the our office
 
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:33.790 align:start position:0%
could do an audit of the Attorney
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
General's Office thank you and it
 
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:40.690 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be able to start until
 
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
late in the year or next year right so
 
01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:46.780 align:start position:0%
again with performance audits
 
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:48.460 align:start position:0%
there's the legislative performance
 
01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:50.500 align:start position:0%
audit an oversight committee that
 
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:53.710 align:start position:0%
directs the the topics that they like
 
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:57.010 align:start position:0%
audited and a list of topics that have
 
01:21:59.280 --> 01:21:59.290 align:start position:0%
kind of in play at the moment so our
 
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:03.100 align:start position:0%
auditors are two audits were just ending
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
so they would be starting to hot
 
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:07.660 align:start position:0%
performance and one was started when we
 
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:12.850 align:start position:0%
exited the building back in March it
 
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
would probably not happen until later
 
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:18.610 align:start position:0%
here or early next year that they would
 
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.010 align:start position:0%
get a chance to start that okay thank
 
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:26.410 align:start position:0%
you very much I think that helps to
 
01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:32.970 align:start position:0%
clarify that particular option I believe
 
01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:40.350 align:start position:0%
that on we have several options here on
 
01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
the option we do not have is to do on
 
01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:50.370 align:start position:0%
substantial further amendment of this
 
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:56.260 align:start position:0%
this amendment unless we unless it is
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
done within the next couple of days and
 
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:06.010 align:start position:0%
available to the whole committee on next
 
01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:11.050 align:start position:0%
week at which time there would probably
 
01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:14.550 align:start position:0%
be a fair amount of discussion of it and
 
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
I guess at that point we would be able
 
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:25.060 align:start position:0%
to free to do the discussion again in
 
01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
the exact session which exact session is
 
01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:30.940 align:start position:0%
going to have to be short whenever it is
 
01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:34.450 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a we don't get
 
01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:36.820 align:start position:0%
much more bandwidth out of the general
 
01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:44.790 align:start position:0%
court for this or whether that point
 
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:48.910 align:start position:0%
most motions of the other kinds which
 
01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be either interim study or ITL to
 
01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:56.470 align:start position:0%
allow the sponsors to develop it again
 
01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:03.580 align:start position:0%
on if we did in ITL
 
01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:07.690 align:start position:0%
on I believe with interim study we don't
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
get to write anything or do we gen I
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
can't remember now the interim study
 
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:21.190 align:start position:0%
motion will go to the full chamber and
 
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:23.470 align:start position:0%
bill you would keep with ya
 
01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:27.190 align:start position:0%
so the interns no we can't do enter on a
 
01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:30.190 align:start position:0%
retained bill the first term here is for
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure a B and there is a committee report
 
01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:34.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so there is a committee reports
 
01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:39.700 align:start position:0%
either of those could include a request
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
for a performance audit if we wanted to
 
01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
go that route so I don't know if there's
 
01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:49.660 align:start position:0%
any further option in this I'm not
 
01:24:58.580 --> 01:24:58.590 align:start position:0%
seeing any hands go up so let us try
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
this you can vote for as many of these
 
01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:06.100 align:start position:0%
as you want by raising your hand this is
 
01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:07.030 align:start position:0%
a straw vote
 
01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
it is totally non-binding on just as the
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
first committee vote is not not not
 
01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:17.260 align:start position:0%
binding on the second committee when it
 
01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:21.700 align:start position:0%
gets its own look at things on remember
 
01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:35.470 align:start position:0%
senator brownie has to send them to
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
raise their heads thank you so all hands
 
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:44.350 align:start position:0%
down at the moment go through these in
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
this order revised amendment presented
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
at the exact session which looks like
 
01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:56.740 align:start position:0%
it's going to be just before or just
 
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:00.490 align:start position:0%
after if we do a revised amendment I'm
 
01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:04.540 align:start position:0%
going to do it after we do the revenue
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
estimates on the first of June rather
 
01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
than before because we're going to have
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
to get the revenue estimates done and I
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.529 --> 01:26:22.539 align:start position:0%
on revised amendment on at that time on
 
01:26:27.399 --> 01:26:27.409 align:start position:0%
the second one would be interim study
 
01:26:33.699 --> 01:26:33.709 align:start position:0%
with performance audit requests that
 
01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:37.689 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:41.689 align:start position:0%
over the next week the third one would
 
01:26:45.849 --> 01:26:45.859 align:start position:0%
be without performance audit the fourth
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
one would be ITL so it goes back to the
 
01:26:52.779 --> 01:26:52.789 align:start position:0%
first committee next time with
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
performance audit request and then
 
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.530 align:start position:0%
without this is pretty complicated but
 
01:27:10.389 --> 01:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
is that acceptable so for those of us
 
01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:13.820 align:start position:0%
who can raise our hands my zoom and
 
01:27:16.929 --> 01:27:16.939 align:start position:0%
those who are doing it by star seven a
 
01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
star nine sorry star nine please do
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you would like to see
 
01:27:26.979 --> 01:27:26.989 align:start position:0%
us go forward with a revised amendment
 
01:27:41.979 --> 01:27:41.989 align:start position:0%
at the exact section that seems to be no
 
01:27:51.159 --> 01:27:51.169 align:start position:0%
it's going up six anybody else that's
 
01:27:55.719 --> 01:27:55.729 align:start position:0%
six six votes remember you can vote for
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
six six votes remember you can vote for
multiples

01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
multiples
 
01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.770 align:start position:0%
multiples
[Music]

01:27:58.770 --> 01:27:58.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:01.959 --> 01:28:01.969 align:start position:0%
the second is interim study of with a
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
performance audit request which we would
 
01:28:07.839 --> 01:28:07.849 align:start position:0%
need to define so that we've got
 
01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:16.869 align:start position:0%
need to define so that we've got
everybody

01:28:16.869 --> 01:28:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
that is nine votes looks like that's the
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
end of it the third is an interim study
 
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:54.730 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:01.830 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's stuck at 3:30 votes
 
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:05.740 align:start position:0%
the fourth is ITL with the performance
 
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:16.540 align:start position:0%
audit request yes
 
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:18.910 align:start position:0%
represent Tucker are you are you trying
 
01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
to get our attention
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know how to raise my hand so
 
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:29.950 align:start position:0%
that's the one for me you want to be a
 
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:33.340 align:start position:0%
ticket discount yes I and maybe sometime
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
you could send me a little message to
 
01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:42.610 align:start position:0%
find out I have an eye back other it
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
looks like we're stuck at 9 on that one
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
too and the fifth is ITL with a
 
01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:57.790 align:start position:0%
performance on it you didn't want the
 
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:06.700 align:start position:0%
other one get a clean start
 
01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:15.210 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:18.850 align:start position:0%
the one in the attendees would be Mary
 
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:25.630 align:start position:0%
Griffin that's right okay so so we've
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:36.970 align:start position:0%
so by one vote we've got intern study
 
01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:40.690 align:start position:0%
with a performance audit request mm-hmm
 
01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:48.070 align:start position:0%
coming out yeah we can think about those
 
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:52.750 align:start position:0%
as we go through and and we're both
 
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:55.180 align:start position:0%
groups are going to do caucuses before
 
01:30:58.410 --> 01:30:58.420 align:start position:0%
the final event I would like to point
 
01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:01.390 align:start position:0%
out that we won't have the results of
 
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:05.260 align:start position:0%
the performance audit back in time for
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
the interim study if it's possible to do
 
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:08.590 align:start position:0%
an interim
 
01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:12.130 align:start position:0%
study at all at this point when we don't
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
know when we're going to be able to get
 
01:31:16.410 --> 01:31:16.420 align:start position:0%
back together except in this format
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
which takes a lot of staff time but but
 
01:31:29.339 --> 01:31:29.349 align:start position:0%
that that mm itor the performance
 
01:31:32.939 --> 01:31:32.949 align:start position:0%
ordered are the ones that captured the
 
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:37.900 align:start position:0%
most votes so we should be prepared to
 
01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:40.090 align:start position:0%
discuss those particularly in our
 
01:31:43.649 --> 01:31:43.659 align:start position:0%
caucuses and take them to the executive
 
01:31:48.089 --> 01:31:48.099 align:start position:0%
committee is as necessary you check it a
 
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:53.530 align:start position:0%
vote so does absent of Griffin want to
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
talk no then I say flashed for a minute
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
instead of lighting launched it's luck
 
01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:04.210 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I guess my
 
01:32:05.939 --> 01:32:05.949 align:start position:0%
question was could we do justice some
 
01:32:07.919 --> 01:32:07.929 align:start position:0%
people may be holding off on what their
 
01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:10.330 align:start position:0%
recommendation is based on yet five
 
01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:11.650 align:start position:0%
different options and now we're down to
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
two can we just do another straw poll
 
01:32:16.439 --> 01:32:16.449 align:start position:0%
with just the option of you know fix the
 
01:32:18.359 --> 01:32:18.369 align:start position:0%
amendment and move it forward or IPO
 
01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:20.110 align:start position:0%
with performance audit and see where
 
01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:22.210 align:start position:0%
those votes land because obviously if
 
01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:25.690 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are no it's going to be I
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
deal with performance audit they may not
 
01:32:30.089 --> 01:32:30.099 align:start position:0%
bother worrying about a to fix the
 
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:33.010 align:start position:0%
amendment but if they want to if it
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
looks like we have votes to fix the bill
 
01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:37.929 align:start position:0%
and move it forward fix the amendment
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
then they need to work on that so they
 
01:32:46.589 --> 01:32:46.599 align:start position:0%
need to know to vote short of the ITL
 
01:32:48.899 --> 01:32:48.909 align:start position:0%
and three votes short of the interim
 
01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:53.020 align:start position:0%
study so if we're going to include that
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do a three-way vote I'm
 
01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:00.610 align:start position:0%
just looking to make sure that if the
 
01:33:02.339 --> 01:33:02.349 align:start position:0%
sponsors if they're expected to move
 
01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:04.150 align:start position:0%
forward with the bill with the amendment
 
01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:05.500 align:start position:0%
that they have time to get the amendment
 
01:33:13.339 --> 01:33:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.930 --> 01:33:15.940 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to do three-way I'm
 
01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:20.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's the only way to include the
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
revised amendment the first choice is
 
01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
interim study with performance audit the
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
second choice is ITL where the
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
performance audit the third choice is 80
 
01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:39.170 align:start position:0%
revised amendment to be discussed at the
 
01:33:45.459 --> 01:33:45.469 align:start position:0%
executive session so on could everybody
 
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:50.110 align:start position:0%
raised there and who is in favor of
 
01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:53.860 align:start position:0%
interim study with a performance audit I
 
01:33:56.169 --> 01:33:56.179 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can but it's gonna be
 
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:08.300 align:start position:0%
any different now they are different
 
01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:14.350 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:20.210 align:start position:0%
and the second one is ITL with a
 
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:37.370 align:start position:0%
and that one has nine votes and the
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:45.950 align:start position:0%
represent tiger had raised her hand did
 
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
you get that in the count
 
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:50.530 align:start position:0%
oh no so that's ten votes you mean I
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe so is that correct
 
01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:02.150 align:start position:0%
um representative Tucker but correct
 
01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:06.740 align:start position:0%
okay so that's ten bucks and a revised
 
01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to be discussed and voted on
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
in the executive session please raise
 
01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
the number 60 going up and down didn't
 
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:36.010 align:start position:0%
vote very I was trying to kick and I
 
01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:39.460 align:start position:0%
punched the wrong the wrong buttons okay
 
01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
so which one were you on the the I K the
 
01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:46.750 align:start position:0%
idea was with the an audit is that what
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
I heard
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay and we have five the
 
01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:00.670 align:start position:0%
revised amendment so the revised
 
01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:02.350 align:start position:0%
amendment and the interim study with
 
01:36:05.730 --> 01:36:05.740 align:start position:0%
performance audit tie this time and we
 
01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:10.270 align:start position:0%
have 11 votes for which is a majority of
 
01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:12.430 align:start position:0%
the committee for ITL with the
 
01:36:18.330 --> 01:36:18.340 align:start position:0%
performance audit request on we can
 
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:21.550 align:start position:0%
consider other motions when we get to
 
01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:25.300 align:start position:0%
the exact session but we aren't going to
 
01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:29.050 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of time I would like to
 
01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:35.260 align:start position:0%
see someone from the group that is doing
 
01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:39.220 align:start position:0%
the amendment work with us on what we
 
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:42.370 align:start position:0%
would ask the performance audit
 
01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:46.830 align:start position:0%
committee to look at because it it's
 
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:52.650 align:start position:0%
quite important that we have the the
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions that are necessary to get at
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
how they are using the money and and how
 
01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
they how that money shows up in the
 
01:37:08.970 --> 01:37:08.980 align:start position:0%
accounting in and I'd like to invite
 
01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:11.530 align:start position:0%
representatives Tringham who noticed
 
01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:17.260 align:start position:0%
this problem to weigh in on that too
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we can try to send around to draft
 
01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:25.150 align:start position:0%
I might I think I will try to get Chris
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
Shea to to help us with a basic draft of
 
01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:32.170 align:start position:0%
a request I don't know if that's
 
01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
a request I don't know if that's
appropriate

01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
but I'll ask him on and then we could
 
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:40.530 align:start position:0%
work on refining it to make sure that it
 
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:43.590 align:start position:0%
does what it's what we supposed to do
 
01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
which when you do a performance audit
 
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
the results come out it is a little
 
01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:53.210 align:start position:0%
rather slow it's rather expensive too
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
but the results come out as a report to
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and the document is
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
released on the LBL
 
01:38:07.670 --> 01:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
pages for anybody to read and the
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
department is requested to respond to
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee - to the audit
 
01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:16.650 align:start position:0%
department and then the fiscal committee
 
01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:19.350 align:start position:0%
receives information on whether the
 
01:38:23.210 --> 01:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
department once is willing to make the
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
changes that were requested of it by the
 
01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:29.730 align:start position:0%
audit and it gets followed up on in
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
future years so it is a pretty powerful
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's so much slow tool reps Naomi may I
 
01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:44.550 align:start position:0%
interrupt here please yes yes I could
 
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:47.010 align:start position:0%
help you guys with a letter and I
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
suggested a letter would be to the chair
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee with Senator Reagan
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
currently in CC to our office and what
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
your committee would want to do is as
 
01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:58.350 align:start position:0%
you've stated identify what you
 
01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:00.210 align:start position:0%
potentially see as some issues and what
 
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:02.010 align:start position:0%
you would like the audit to look at that
 
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:03.630 align:start position:0%
way when the committee does convene
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
they'd have an idea of you know why
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
their audits being requested in terms of
 
01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:13.470 align:start position:0%
if the audit is done a report that is
 
01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:15.210 align:start position:0%
presented to the fiscal committee but
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
our auditors would also be willing to
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
present that to the Ways and Means
 
01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:21.390 align:start position:0%
Committee in future we were more than
 
01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:23.670 align:start position:0%
happy to take our audits on the road to
 
01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:28.370 align:start position:0%
the various committee they want that
 
01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:31.530 align:start position:0%
that's that's very helpful thank you yes
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
that that has happened
 
01:39:35.690 --> 01:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
not very often in ways that means but it
 
01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:38.670 align:start position:0%
has happened in the past and reps have
 
01:39:40.979 --> 01:39:40.989 align:start position:0%
Griffin do you want to talk
 
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:45.370 align:start position:0%
No she keeps on turning on and off I
 
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:49.210 align:start position:0%
grabbed the phone oh okay
 
01:39:55.570 --> 01:39:55.580 align:start position:0%
can so I think that's enough at this
 
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:04.510 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
will be discussing these bills in in
 
01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.130 align:start position:0%
will be discussing these bills in in
[Music]

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:11.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:13.940 align:start position:0%
caucuses before we get to the exact
 
01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:18.770 align:start position:0%
session and then again in the XX section
 
01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:21.860 align:start position:0%
I think that we're going to have to put
 
01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:25.610 align:start position:0%
the exact section following the revenue
 
01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:27.470 align:start position:0%
estimates to make sure we get through my
 
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:35.650 align:start position:0%
students done and we then turn to HB
 
01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:42.650 align:start position:0%
1627 FM I want to repeat that the reason
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
that I have been working hard on this
 
01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:50.150 align:start position:0%
amendment with the sponsors is that well
 
01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:52.370 align:start position:0%
there are two reasons one of them is
 
01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:56.330 align:start position:0%
that I can represent major in on the
 
01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:58.190 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund committee for quite a
 
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:01.220 align:start position:0%
while and our committee is charged under
 
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
roles with making sure that the
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds operate are set up
 
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:11.750 align:start position:0%
properly in legislation and are
 
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:17.690 align:start position:0%
reporting properly so this bill came to
 
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:20.630 align:start position:0%
us from environment and agriculture
 
01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:25.670 align:start position:0%
there has had to be quite a lot of work
 
01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:31.970 align:start position:0%
done in terms of the of the specifics of
 
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:35.330 align:start position:0%
when the money can be taken from other
 
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:41.450 align:start position:0%
funds when and if it gets back on and a
 
01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:44.630 align:start position:0%
number of technical issues from the
 
01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:47.060 align:start position:0%
policy committee that got incorporated
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
in as they they moved it entirely to
 
01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.060 align:start position:0%
in as they they moved it entirely to
online

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:52.070 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:41:56.230 --> 01:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
my second reason for working on this is
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
that I do not believe it's appropriate
 
01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:02.650 align:start position:0%
that we have a department left in this
 
01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:09.500 align:start position:0%
state that cannot work virtually as
 
01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:17.950 align:start position:0%
necessary and to do online registration
 
01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.070 align:start position:0%
of health certificates and and the other
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
one which I am forgetting which one it
 
01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:35.650 align:start position:0%
is at this point is going to reduce the
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
staffing overload in the Department of
 
01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
Agriculture quite a lot and make it
 
01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
easier once it is set up for the
 
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:53.630 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to to work with this and
 
01:42:59.220 --> 01:42:59.230 align:start position:0%
for people to get information on
 
01:43:02.370 --> 01:43:02.380 align:start position:0%
presumably for people to get information
 
01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:04.940 align:start position:0%
when there's been a rabies bite or
 
01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:08.930 align:start position:0%
something of that sort so I had an
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that the last piece of which
 
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:17.410 align:start position:0%
unfortunately just came out last night
 
01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:21.950 align:start position:0%
that is because I was told that if we do
 
01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:26.690 align:start position:0%
not separate out the very clearly the
 
01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:32.780 align:start position:0%
dates of permission and different
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
transfers into all of the component
 
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:38.750 align:start position:0%
parts that OLS would change the
 
01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:40.610 align:start position:0%
amendment when it came to them and we
 
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:43.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that again part of the
 
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:46.220 align:start position:0%
problem has been that we took the
 
01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:49.190 align:start position:0%
amendment two ls and they said there is
 
01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:52.430 align:start position:0%
not sufficient specificity here they put
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the specificity and the department
 
01:43:59.620 --> 01:43:59.630 align:start position:0%
was not happy with the specificity and
 
01:44:01.690 --> 01:44:01.700 align:start position:0%
in fact it did not
 
01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:05.330 align:start position:0%
three flex the timetable of where the
 
01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:08.300 align:start position:0%
money is going back and forth I don't
 
01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:10.220 align:start position:0%
know how many people have had a chance
 
01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:13.820 align:start position:0%
to look at the amended version this
 
01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:30.260 align:start position:0%
the yellow pieces are the parts that
 
01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:34.070 align:start position:0%
were sent to everybody last week and the
 
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:39.010 align:start position:0%
I believe it was last week and the blue
 
01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:45.020 align:start position:0%
are are really as far as I can tell
 
01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:49.580 align:start position:0%
technical corrections to that to make
 
01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:53.570 align:start position:0%
sure that every single change in who can
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
transfer money to whom and who can't is
 
01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:04.370 align:start position:0%
separated out in the enacting language
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
and the repeal language at the proper
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
times so and then Chris a suggestion
 
01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:21.530 align:start position:0%
I also returned to the original idea
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:24.630 align:start position:0%
I also returned to the original idea
sorry

01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:29.660 align:start position:0%
idea I just managed to get myself out of
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
this Jennifer if you can go one page
 
01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:39.130 align:start position:0%
down yes there to the original
 
01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:42.530 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we had which is that I
 
01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:47.150 align:start position:0%
broke off section 5 from section 4 in
 
01:45:52.150 --> 01:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
the first section to allow the parts of
 
01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:57.770 align:start position:0%
this complex amendment that would be
 
01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:01.300 align:start position:0%
repealed after all the transfers stopped
 
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:05.420 align:start position:0%
to be removed cleanly from the language
 
01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:08.750 align:start position:0%
of the law so that they would it would
 
01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:13.190 align:start position:0%
not be be visible when it is no longer
 
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
not be be visible when it is no longer
necessary

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:14.450 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:19.190 align:start position:0%
for anything the rest of section one
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
ends with the database fund shelter long
 
01:46:25.710 --> 01:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
no no they go back up a bit
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
or I can read it off myself put your
 
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:31.010 align:start position:0%
back up a bit there you go
 
01:46:33.730 --> 01:46:33.740 align:start position:0%
the database funchal draw monies only
 
01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:35.900 align:start position:0%
from grants appropriations and the fees
 
01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:42.410 align:start position:0%
in RSA 437 88 it could just say the fees
 
01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:47.870 align:start position:0%
in 43 437 8a but if they had sometimes
 
01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:52.460 align:start position:0%
got extra money to further develop the
 
01:46:55.210 --> 01:46:55.220 align:start position:0%
direct database for instance I wanted to
 
01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:02.390 align:start position:0%
leave that option in then section 5 is
 
01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:04.970 align:start position:0%
the part that gets repealed after five
 
01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
years and it says that notwithstanding
 
01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
section four of the funds shall be
 
01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
initiated by transfers from agricultural
 
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:18.250 align:start position:0%
product and skill testing fund
 
01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:22.370 align:start position:0%
established and the integrated pest
 
01:47:26.890 --> 01:47:26.900 align:start position:0%
management fund and after the animal
 
01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:29.690 align:start position:0%
records database is operational the
 
01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:31.580 align:start position:0%
Commissioner may reimburse the
 
01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:33.770 align:start position:0%
agricultural product and scale testing
 
01:47:35.230 --> 01:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
fund and the integrated pest management
 
01:47:38.050 --> 01:47:38.060 align:start position:0%
fund over a period of five years as laid
 
01:47:41.110 --> 01:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
out in the sections that are towards the
 
01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:45.110 align:start position:0%
end of the bill and one of the things I
 
01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:47.650 align:start position:0%
learned during this process of amending
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
was that the Commissioner does not think
 
01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:52.940 align:start position:0%
he will be able to totally reimburse
 
01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:57.710 align:start position:0%
those funds on over a period of time we
 
01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:00.710 align:start position:0%
didn't want to leave this completely
 
01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:04.970 align:start position:0%
open-ended on those two funds contain
 
01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:14.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.919 --> 01:48:20.929 align:start position:0%
removed from their bylaw changes or over
 
01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:27.190 align:start position:0%
a very long period of time removed by
 
01:48:31.419 --> 01:48:31.429 align:start position:0%
reducing fees somewhat which fees would
 
01:48:34.029 --> 01:48:34.039 align:start position:0%
have to bounce back after that period of
 
01:48:37.359 --> 01:48:37.369 align:start position:0%
time because for three years
 
01:48:41.529 --> 01:48:41.539 align:start position:0%
I think it's they were collecting fees
 
01:48:44.589 --> 01:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
to pay for salaries that did not happen
 
01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:50.210 align:start position:0%
because people were not hired in those
 
01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:52.550 align:start position:0%
positions I am Not sure at this point
 
01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:55.630 align:start position:0%
whether they were not hired because the
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
budget did not allow them to be hired at
 
01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:03.050 align:start position:0%
that time or whether it was that the
 
01:49:09.089 --> 01:49:09.099 align:start position:0%
previous commissioner did not like so
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
but the money is there it is not being
 
01:49:15.419 --> 01:49:15.429 align:start position:0%
used for the purposes of the fund and
 
01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be used unless they in they
 
01:49:21.279 --> 01:49:21.289 align:start position:0%
expand what the fund is paying for
 
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:24.260 align:start position:0%
inside the department which they could
 
01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:26.270 align:start position:0%
do themselves if they thought this was
 
01:49:31.959 --> 01:49:31.969 align:start position:0%
necessary and so it is that money that
 
01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:35.150 align:start position:0%
would be being siphoned off to the other
 
01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:40.190 align:start position:0%
fund to create the database and on that
 
01:49:44.399 --> 01:49:44.409 align:start position:0%
there would be an option at the end of
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
in the last three years of that period
 
01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:53.380 align:start position:0%
to take the money back into those funds
 
01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:57.170 align:start position:0%
and the Commissioner has told me that he
 
01:50:00.339 --> 01:50:00.349 align:start position:0%
is not he does not believe that there
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient money to reimburse
 
01:50:06.939 --> 01:50:06.949 align:start position:0%
all of it so that's the general
 
01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:11.420 align:start position:0%
situation as we found it out as we did
 
01:50:15.609 --> 01:50:15.619 align:start position:0%
as we tried to do this amendment I don't
 
01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
know if
 
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
know if
[Music]

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:20.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:22.370 align:start position:0%
representative I've lost the
 
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:25.850 align:start position:0%
participants now on the attendees if the
 
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:29.900 align:start position:0%
Commissioner or representative Bixby or
 
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:34.340 align:start position:0%
the Agriculture Committee wants to speak
 
01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:39.470 align:start position:0%
on what I've just said or and correct me
 
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
or otherwise the Commissioner and
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby would you like me
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
to bring them both on on at the same
 
01:50:57.070 --> 01:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
time can you do that or we can go one
 
01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:00.380 align:start position:0%
after the other years is 385 five one
 
01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:07.490 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner okay making nice him to
 
01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:11.690 align:start position:0%
speak good morning
 
01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:14.090 align:start position:0%
I think that chairman Omni has done a
 
01:51:16.810 --> 01:51:16.820 align:start position:0%
very good job of summarizing the
 
01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:22.190 align:start position:0%
situation and that very pleased with the
 
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:24.260 align:start position:0%
would the changes I think that does
 
01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:27.470 align:start position:0%
exactly what what our intent is be glad
 
01:51:31.150 --> 01:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you that
 
01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:36.530 align:start position:0%
was very brief do you want to say
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:37.060 align:start position:0%
was very brief do you want to say
anything

01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:37.070 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:43.700 align:start position:0%
there you are yes so I was I have ones
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:48.970 align:start position:0%
very small concern which is on page two
 
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:55.250 align:start position:0%
it says section 4 in section 1 it says
 
01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:57.290 align:start position:0%
the database are shallow only draw
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
monies from Grants appropriations and
 
01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:03.350 align:start position:0%
fees in RSA 437 in the next section it
 
01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:05.900 align:start position:0%
says notwithstanding the funds shall be
 
01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:08.750 align:start position:0%
initiated by transfers from agricultural
 
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:10.970 align:start position:0%
products till and scale testing fund and
 
01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:12.650 align:start position:0%
deemed and the integrated pest
 
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:15.470 align:start position:0%
management fund but it doesn't specify
 
01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:20.930 align:start position:0%
that those the the possible transfers
 
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:23.690 align:start position:0%
from those funds in the first two years
 
01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:28.370 align:start position:0%
of operability as mentioned in the later
 
01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
sections would be allowed and I just
 
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that
 
01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:36.750 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if that if those would
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
be considered part of the initiation or
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
if that needs to be further amended in
 
01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:45.170 align:start position:0%
order to take care of that
 
01:52:55.689 --> 01:52:55.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:00.630 align:start position:0%
if he's still over here with us yes yes
 
01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:14.090 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead on whether we are in lines
 
01:53:23.899 --> 01:53:23.909 align:start position:0%
three to five the yellow part on we
 
01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:26.790 align:start position:0%
ought to amend that to make reference
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
specific reference to I guess it would
 
01:53:53.530 --> 01:53:53.540 align:start position:0%
be artists RSA 43054 a and and 4 34 35
 
01:53:58.580 --> 01:53:58.590 align:start position:0%
24 a which are further towards at the
 
01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:02.190 align:start position:0%
end which are the words that spend the
 
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:04.170 align:start position:0%
money in the first transfer the money in
 
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:08.010 align:start position:0%
the first two years to the database so
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
when what I would suggest is that when
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment is when you decide that
 
01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:13.110 align:start position:0%
you want have a final version of this
 
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:16.770 align:start position:0%
you know LS will draft it but be clear
 
01:54:20.419 --> 01:54:20.429 align:start position:0%
that you want what pieces you want
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
repealed when and then what pieces you
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
want remaining and and they would
 
01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:27.630 align:start position:0%
coordinate that with the appeals and the
 
01:54:29.419 --> 01:54:29.429 align:start position:0%
effective dates are those repeals so if
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
you needed certain language to still
 
01:54:35.959 --> 01:54:35.969 align:start position:0%
exist through the fifth year and that
 
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:38.610 align:start position:0%
you see in the two-year part of it then
 
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:39.690 align:start position:0%
you would need to include it in both
 
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:42.570 align:start position:0%
places it's hard for me to respond
 
01:54:44.359 --> 01:54:44.369 align:start position:0%
greatly to this because I can't see it
 
01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:45.690 align:start position:0%
all at the moment yeah
 
01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:48.270 align:start position:0%
right and not having Lori conversations
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
that you've had but I think that again
 
01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:54.260 align:start position:0%
the committee would want to be quick
 
01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:56.670 align:start position:0%
what they anticipate is going to happen
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
going forward when in five years from
 
01:55:02.479 --> 01:55:02.489 align:start position:0%
now there's people trying to figure out
 
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
what did you intend to have happen yes
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
so so I think that that probably
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mean a references right there
 
01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:18.910 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mean a references right there
too

01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:23.550 align:start position:0%
to those this is just as complicated as
 
01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
as the drunk driving legislation was and
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
this that that that yellow section
 
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
should include references to the parts
 
01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:45.930 align:start position:0%
below that are for for a and and five at
 
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
the very end in about the second to last
 
01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:03.630 align:start position:0%
page yeah that's done you're going
 
01:56:10.570 --> 01:56:10.580 align:start position:0%
through them now well the eighties are
 
01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
reference reference the first two years
 
01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:17.370 align:start position:0%
when the transfers are going out from
 
01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:21.150 align:start position:0%
those funds this is all after the fund
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
has been and been operationalized so for
 
01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:30.690 align:start position:0%
two years after that funds can continue
 
01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:33.750 align:start position:0%
to go out of the first two dedicate the
 
01:56:37.670 --> 01:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
existing dedicated funds to support the
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
new dedicated fund for the database
 
01:56:44.150 --> 01:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
the bees are after five years all
 
01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:49.890 align:start position:0%
transfers and and section five in the
 
01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:55.050 align:start position:0%
blue says that at the end of that period
 
01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:57.510 align:start position:0%
the authority of the Department of
 
01:56:59.240 --> 01:56:59.250 align:start position:0%
Agriculture to move
 
01:57:05.590 --> 01:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth in anyway ends so that
 
01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:09.150 align:start position:0%
eliminates the section up at the
 
01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:10.830 align:start position:0%
beginning that we were looking at that
 
01:57:14.630 --> 01:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
was is added on to the definition of the
 
01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:24.150 align:start position:0%
we can just look at integrated
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
management pest management fund which is
 
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
on there now on which you had before
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
except that I duplicated on Roman four
 
01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:37.310 align:start position:0%
which was in there before was was a
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
simple Roman four on referring to the
 
01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:45.450 align:start position:0%
transfers both during the first two
 
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
years and during the last three years of
 
01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:52.050 align:start position:0%
that the five years total I separated
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
them out into the part that would be
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to transfer the first two years
 
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:00.210 align:start position:0%
that's a and the part that would be
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to be transferred the second
 
01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:05.850 align:start position:0%
three years on the last of the five
 
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
years that's B and then below that the
 
01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
A's and the B's are appealed at two
 
01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
years and five years respectively
 
01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:25.170 align:start position:0%
so it's tell me if you're ready for them
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
from yes yes I think we're it's time to
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
go to the questions and I believe
 
01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Sandberg tried to put his
 
01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
hand up before I started this so we'll
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:45.170 align:start position:0%
can you yes yes can you hear me now yes
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
I appreciate all the hard work you did
 
01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:52.350 align:start position:0%
on this on page two the lines three
 
01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:56.210 align:start position:0%
through seven you began you said
 
01:58:58.820 --> 01:58:58.830 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding section for the funds
 
01:59:02.090 --> 01:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
shall be initiated and then on line six
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner may reimbursed my
 
01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
question is and I realize that there's
 
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:17.870 align:start position:0%
if I were in charge of a department
 
01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:21.930 align:start position:0%
would I not come before and have drafted
 
01:59:24.710 --> 01:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
or asked for more revenue from the
 
01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:28.170 align:start position:0%
general fund I just don't like the idea
 
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:31.710 align:start position:0%
you've charged for people for
 
01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:34.170 align:start position:0%
agricultural products scale testing fund
 
01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:36.930 align:start position:0%
fees integrated pest management they
 
01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:40.290 align:start position:0%
were going specifically toward that when
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
will this fund ever be reimbursed all
 
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
its money need to be reimbursed
 
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:54.990 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper wanted to yes yes if
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
I could when we began this process there
 
02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:06.750 align:start position:0%
was a lot of uncertainty about just what
 
02:00:09.590 --> 02:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
was going to be needed where I'd still
 
02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:13.310 align:start position:0%
want to to allow for some flexibility I
 
02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:16.110 align:start position:0%
expect most of the money it's not all
 
02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:17.610 align:start position:0%
the money to actually come out of the
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
product and scale testing fund that
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
title is a little bit misleading but
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
that was the title that commissioner
 
02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:32.070 align:start position:0%
Taylor chose decades ago so most of this
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
money the money comes from product
 
02:00:37.150 --> 02:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
registration and that's all animal feed
 
02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:43.170 align:start position:0%
really so it is appropriate and there is
 
02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:45.150 align:start position:0%
a nexus because so much of that is pet
 
02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
food so we believe that using that fund
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
really does fulfill the mission because
 
02:00:59.680 --> 02:00:59.690 align:start position:0%
it goes to something that has to do with
 
02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:04.170 align:start position:0%
with the animals so we knew we were not
 
02:01:05.210 --> 02:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
going to get a general fund
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation and had to try to be
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
creative and how we could actually do
 
02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:12.150 align:start position:0%
this because it would take a lot more
 
02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:14.210 align:start position:0%
people to what I could actually
 
02:01:17.090 --> 02:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goal of what the
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislature has tasked us with doing
 
02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:23.370 align:start position:0%
which is to up all all of these the
 
02:01:25.190 --> 02:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
licensing procedure for all these pet
 
02:01:26.630 --> 02:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
vendors which is just
 
02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:29.730 align:start position:0%
not humanly possible for us to do with
 
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:32.010 align:start position:0%
the staff we did get one more person on
 
02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:36.330 align:start position:0%
board but we're still not doing what we
 
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:38.970 align:start position:0%
should be doing and so we did find the
 
02:01:38.970 --> 02:01:39.890 align:start position:0%
should be doing and so we did find the
Nexus

02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
Nexus
 
02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:43.950 align:start position:0%
I think it's appropriate and ultimately
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
that is your judgment call may I follow
 
02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:51.990 align:start position:0%
up with a question for the Commissioner
 
02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:55.790 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair yes I have one too
 
02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:58.710 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper uh if the word may
 
02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:04.950 align:start position:0%
is turned to shell shell reimbursed does
 
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
the five-year period give you enough
 
02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:09.030 align:start position:0%
time to maybe come up with an approach
 
02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:15.450 align:start position:0%
to the General Assembly to fulfill the
 
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:17.790 align:start position:0%
amount of money that you will transfer
 
02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:23.190 align:start position:0%
out I perhaps a little concerned by the
 
02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:25.170 align:start position:0%
word shell but then I think it it also
 
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
says under yo under the another section
 
02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
of the RSA which I think makes it clear
 
02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
that I don't have to if the money's not
 
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
there so are we going to come up with
 
02:02:42.850 --> 02:02:42.860 align:start position:0%
another way we don't know how much that
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
how much those fees are going to bring
 
02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:49.230 align:start position:0%
in and again I mean this is really up to
 
02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature we want to be reasonable
 
02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
with the fee and at the same time you
 
02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:00.570 align:start position:0%
know have some hope of reimbursing it my
 
02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
idea originally was to leave that
 
02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:05.370 align:start position:0%
open-ended the legislature to this point
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
is decided having that open-ended is not
 
02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:10.230 align:start position:0%
the best idea so I thought all right
 
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:11.850 align:start position:0%
well maybe we'll do this in dribs and
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
drabs and it might take us a decade but
 
02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:16.230 align:start position:0%
I understand the thought process there
 
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:19.230 align:start position:0%
so I think putting me in a little bit of
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
an unfair situation where my idea was
 
02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:23.850 align:start position:0%
let's do it over whatever period of time
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
it takes but the legislature is saying
 
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
no you need to do within five years and
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
so now asking me to come up with another
 
02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:34.770 align:start position:0%
way of accomplishing that really not
 
02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:36.630 align:start position:0%
something I'm crazy about I'd rather
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:46.730 align:start position:0%
what commissioner Jasper well I got two
 
02:03:51.070 --> 02:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions now one of them is do you this
 
02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:52.850 align:start position:0%
money that we're talking about in these
 
02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds is essentially one-time
 
02:03:59.920 --> 02:03:59.930 align:start position:0%
money you are maintaining those two
 
02:04:06.190 --> 02:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
programs at the extent that on you or
 
02:04:09.550 --> 02:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
the US prior legislation considered
 
02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:15.350 align:start position:0%
necessary on without that that money is
 
02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:18.020 align:start position:0%
there something else that you can be
 
02:04:21.490 --> 02:04:21.500 align:start position:0%
doing in in those areas and I'm more
 
02:04:23.410 --> 02:04:23.420 align:start position:0%
concerned about the integrated pest
 
02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:25.100 align:start position:0%
management fund which I don't think has
 
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
Nexus then is there something else you
 
02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:33.170 align:start position:0%
can be doing with that money in the
 
02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:37.930 align:start position:0%
future to absorb it or because
 
02:04:40.330 --> 02:04:40.340 align:start position:0%
alternatively we ought to be either
 
02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:43.190 align:start position:0%
lowering lowering the user fees which
 
02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:45.830 align:start position:0%
would then require raising them again
 
02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:56.450 align:start position:0%
once the money was spent thank you for
 
02:05:00.070 --> 02:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
the question yeah that money was built
 
02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:02.690 align:start position:0%
up essentially as one-time money under
 
02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:07.370 align:start position:0%
the current mechanism that we're using
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:08.910 align:start position:0%
the current mechanism that we're using
it

02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is excess money however you know we
 
02:05:21.150 --> 02:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
all know what state the revenue is and
 
02:05:25.810 --> 02:05:25.820 align:start position:0%
so frankly one of my my thoughts which
 
02:05:27.970 --> 02:05:27.980 align:start position:0%
would you know be through the budget
 
02:05:30.610 --> 02:05:30.620 align:start position:0%
process would be to look at actually
 
02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:34.910 align:start position:0%
using the excess revenues there in there
 
02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:40.130 align:start position:0%
above and beyond even this to keep the
 
02:05:43.150 --> 02:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
department operating without layoffs
 
02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:47.540 align:start position:0%
because our we produce revenue generally
 
02:05:49.450 --> 02:05:49.460 align:start position:0%
speaking when you when you look at what
 
02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:51.090 align:start position:0%
we bring in and what were you
 
02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:53.790 align:start position:0%
and then what we turn over to the
 
02:05:57.530 --> 02:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
general fund we are about a break-even
 
02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:00.230 align:start position:0%
if not a little bit net positive
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
operation here but if we are forced to
 
02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:07.650 align:start position:0%
do layoffs we're likely to have a
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
negative effect on the general general
 
02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
fund with no real positive results of
 
02:06:17.210 --> 02:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
laying people off so I'd like to be able
 
02:06:19.730 --> 02:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
to explore the possibility of keeping
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
our ability to generate revenues going
 
02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:26.550 align:start position:0%
without during this crisis actually
 
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:29.370 align:start position:0%
having a drawdown on on the general fund
 
02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
for our operations so that's sort of
 
02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:37.170 align:start position:0%
where my thoughts are right now thank
 
02:06:37.170 --> 02:06:40.270 align:start position:0%
where my thoughts are right now thank
you

02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
we had representative streams seems to
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
be the only one with his hand up at the
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
moment yeah first of all madam chair
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the great work on this
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
amendment if we're that seriously
 
02:06:59.890 --> 02:06:59.900 align:start position:0%
concerned we're not going to be able to
 
02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:03.030 align:start position:0%
replenish the fund at the end of five
 
02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:05.970 align:start position:0%
years you know you said you wanted to be
 
02:07:10.250 --> 02:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
kind of reasonable in terms of how much
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
to charge for this is $3 is not
 
02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.230 align:start position:0%
to charge for this is $3 is not
reasonable

02:07:15.230 --> 02:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
you know is $2 there really something
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
magical about the $2 number and I know
 
02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
we talked about it a little bit before
 
02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:25.590 align:start position:0%
but you know might we have a little
 
02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
extra wiggle room if we've brought it up
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
to $3 or or somewhere between two and
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
three dollars you may well being in old
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
ways in meanors myself I'm very
 
02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:47.910 align:start position:0%
cognizant that 125 percent rule that try
 
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:51.710 align:start position:0%
to operate within and and I think that
 
02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:57.390 align:start position:0%
going beyond that $2 you know is sort of
 
02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
a outside of that that realm even though
 
02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:06.650 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.439 --> 02:08:09.449 align:start position:0%
that you know is related to the fund
 
02:08:11.930 --> 02:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's normal not normally the way we we
 
02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:15.630 align:start position:0%
do that and I think there'll be a lot of
 
02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:17.550 align:start position:0%
pushback we've already gotten to some
 
02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:21.090 align:start position:0%
pushback but in the in the range of $2
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
I'm able to really say to the people are
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
going to be paying this fee you're
 
02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:31.110 align:start position:0%
probably coming out about net neutral at
 
02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:33.210 align:start position:0%
that point because you've got postage to
 
02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:34.770 align:start position:0%
consider you've got to make copies
 
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.079 align:start position:0%
you've got to put it in envelopes there
 
02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
are all these things that you have to do
 
02:08:41.959 --> 02:08:41.969 align:start position:0%
versus if we do it electronically you're
 
02:08:44.899 --> 02:08:44.909 align:start position:0%
going to save a lot on time and in
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
physical materials and postage but we
 
02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:50.670 align:start position:0%
have gotten some pushback even at at the
 
02:08:54.319 --> 02:08:54.329 align:start position:0%
level of going up to - my feeling was if
 
02:08:57.020 --> 02:08:57.030 align:start position:0%
you know the legislature doesn't rightly
 
02:08:59.959 --> 02:08:59.969 align:start position:0%
so want to give us a an open-end on the
 
02:09:02.810 --> 02:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
fee we think that we're probably at a
 
02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:04.710 align:start position:0%
dollar and a quarter maybe a dollar and
 
02:09:08.089 --> 02:09:08.099 align:start position:0%
fifty cents and by the time we got to
 
02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
that two dollar range it would be
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to come back in a lot
 
02:09:14.419 --> 02:09:14.429 align:start position:0%
and ask the legislature to allow us to
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
raise that fee if it gets the point of
 
02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:23.090 align:start position:0%
being necessary again it's all you know
 
02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:26.070 align:start position:0%
your call these were our our suggestions
 
02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:29.190 align:start position:0%
on how to how to do this and garner
 
02:09:33.319 --> 02:09:33.329 align:start position:0%
enough votes in the legislature and have
 
02:09:35.209 --> 02:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
the support of the governor - to make
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
this a reality thank you for that the
 
02:09:44.419 --> 02:09:44.429 align:start position:0%
other question I had for you madam chair
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
was why is wet why is the the sunset
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
provision on some of these provisions
 
02:09:56.479 --> 02:09:56.489 align:start position:0%
set at five years for for the provisions
 
02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:00.570 align:start position:0%
effect - well that's something that
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps we ought to discuss ten years
 
02:10:08.899 --> 02:10:08.909 align:start position:0%
seemed much too long legislatively that
 
02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:13.530 align:start position:0%
we would forget that this
 
02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
on this sunset was in there at all and a
 
02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:20.910 align:start position:0%
future Commissioner of Agriculture might
 
02:10:24.290 --> 02:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
not happily go along continuing the
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
previous procedures without realizing
 
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
that it had sunsetted this has happened
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
quite frequently in in the legislature
 
02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:37.290 align:start position:0%
partly because on things like that are
 
02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:40.410 align:start position:0%
put into Chapter law and the chapter law
 
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:45.630 align:start position:0%
is only available to some people mostly
 
02:10:47.210 --> 02:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
El Bao
 
02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
and so you discover provisions such as
 
02:10:57.110 --> 02:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
one that we just discovered that the the
 
02:11:01.210 --> 02:11:01.220 align:start position:0%
Senate just discovered that the BRZ
 
02:11:05.530 --> 02:11:05.540 align:start position:0%
program the economic redevelopment
 
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone program sunsets in
 
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:14.430 align:start position:0%
January and has a bill that that they
 
02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:17.310 align:start position:0%
put in heartedly to fix that that they
 
02:11:19.190 --> 02:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
added complications to that we haven't
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
not yet the program sunsets in January
 
02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
and so we have to make a decision this
 
02:11:34.490 --> 02:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
year and we're in combing and that kind
 
02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
of thing has happened a number of times
 
02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
over the years that something is in
 
02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:42.090 align:start position:0%
Chapter law and we we do not remember it
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
on the Commissioner changes the
 
02:11:48.230 --> 02:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioner doesn't remember it so it
 
02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:50.370 align:start position:0%
just seemed like 10 years was too long
 
02:11:54.170 --> 02:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
but I would welcome Commissioner
 
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
Jasper's thoughts on this or anyone else
 
02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
who wants to madam chairman I I think
 
02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
certainly that you know if we stay with
 
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:08.010 align:start position:0%
the five years we can revisit the
 
02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:10.470 align:start position:0%
situation in five years and see what the
 
02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:12.210 align:start position:0%
legislature to do at that point
 
02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
but in unless there are any direct
 
02:12:17.650 --> 02:12:17.660 align:start position:0%
questions for me right now unfortunately
 
02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:20.430 align:start position:0%
I'm on a rather tight schedule and I
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
really need to drop off the call in the
 
02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:24.890 align:start position:0%
next couple of minutes
 
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
next couple of minutes
[Music]

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:26.370 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:29.790 align:start position:0%
a minute on my the integrated pest
 
02:12:35.630 --> 02:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
management fund is as a nexus it really
 
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't that's a you know but
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature is always free to do
 
02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
what it wants as we know are too many
 
02:12:46.730 --> 02:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
funds have been raided and we just
 
02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:49.550 align:start position:0%
looked at this as where there was
 
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:52.170 align:start position:0%
available funding without totally
 
02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:56.300 align:start position:0%
drawing down on to on the other fund
 
02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:00.630 align:start position:0%
because obviously we have a guesstimate
 
02:13:04.190 --> 02:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
as to what this program is going to cost
 
02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:08.030 align:start position:0%
us but until we actually go out to bid
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to know and so I didn't
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
want to leave us in a situation where we
 
02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
were depleting one account and had too
 
02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:19.170 align:start position:0%
much money there that you're correct
 
02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:23.970 align:start position:0%
there's no nexus again that is the it's
 
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:26.550 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the legislature to
 
02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
draw money from wherever it exists so if
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
we directed you to reimburse that one
 
02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:37.950 align:start position:0%
first before the other one which does
 
02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:42.930 align:start position:0%
have clear Nexus that would be very
 
02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:44.610 align:start position:0%
reasonable that would be very reasonable
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
in my opinion yes okay just just so just
 
02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:06.210 align:start position:0%
big picture by not having our votes with
 
02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
us from the hearing to kind of think how
 
02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:13.370 align:start position:0%
fast the Jenelle will be to the LOB
 
02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:17.370 align:start position:0%
because without fees there's three
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
places where there's a two dollar fee
 
02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:22.770 align:start position:0%
those days are all new correct and the
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
more on number two they will initially
 
02:14:28.190 --> 02:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
those fees will go to this development
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
as well was the new computer system
 
02:14:36.150 --> 02:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
if I may the fees are intended to go to
 
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
the annual maintenance cost of the
 
02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:42.610 align:start position:0%
program that's the primary purpose again
 
02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have set numbers but where
 
02:14:48.150 --> 02:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
we've been told to expect that the
 
02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:50.530 align:start position:0%
maintenance of this program is in the
 
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
range of about two hundred and fifty
 
02:14:59.250 --> 02:14:59.260 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year on commissioner
 
02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:01.330 align:start position:0%
Jasper I believe we only have two
 
02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:05.490 align:start position:0%
thieves in this not three correct I
 
02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:09.190 align:start position:0%
believe you're right but I've sort of
 
02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
forgotten about this the details of this
 
02:15:28.250 --> 02:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill it's been a while now so there are
 
02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at it one way there are
 
02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:36.910 align:start position:0%
three because there is a certificate
 
02:15:39.330 --> 02:15:39.340 align:start position:0%
there's a health certificate waiver and
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
those could logically those are lumped
 
02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:47.050 align:start position:0%
as one sort of thing but you could see
 
02:15:49.170 --> 02:15:49.180 align:start position:0%
that as being two separate fees one for
 
02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:50.770 align:start position:0%
one if you get the health certificate
 
02:15:52.230 --> 02:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
one if you get the health certificate
 
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:54.580 align:start position:0%
waiver but you would not you would never
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
have someone who got both the health
 
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:01.390 align:start position:0%
certificate and the waiver so and then
 
02:16:03.330 --> 02:16:03.340 align:start position:0%
separate from that there's the fee for
 
02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:14.140 align:start position:0%
the for the rabies thank you me I'm
 
02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:15.790 align:start position:0%
representing the Brahmi has to follow up
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
and would you like milk a screen share
 
02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:21.100 align:start position:0%
would you like to keep that up um oh I
 
02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:23.790 align:start position:0%
think can we put down the screen share
 
02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:33.790 align:start position:0%
okay removes that rami product the
 
02:16:35.879 --> 02:16:35.889 align:start position:0%
computer systems being developed the
 
02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:38.410 align:start position:0%
first couple of years we start
 
02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
collecting these fees if I may no that's
 
02:16:51.810 --> 02:16:51.820 align:start position:0%
that's why we put the certification in
 
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
there that until such time as the
 
02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:56.830 align:start position:0%
Commissioner certifies that the program
 
02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:00.070 align:start position:0%
is operational no fees will be collected
 
02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:01.870 align:start position:0%
it would be you know in my opinion
 
02:17:04.890 --> 02:17:04.900 align:start position:0%
unfair to have people have to send in
 
02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:07.510 align:start position:0%
potentially the paper documents and at
 
02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:09.580 align:start position:0%
the same time pay a fee for the
 
02:17:11.430 --> 02:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
electronic program which doesn't exist
 
02:17:22.290 --> 02:17:22.300 align:start position:0%
so no fees until we're live ninety day
 
02:17:25.919 --> 02:17:25.929 align:start position:0%
period in your timeline which suggests
 
02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:30.250 align:start position:0%
that on during that period some people I
 
02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
guess would be using this now
 
02:17:34.290 --> 02:17:34.300 align:start position:0%
operational system and paying the fee
 
02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:36.910 align:start position:0%
and other people would be using the
 
02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:41.050 align:start position:0%
paper system I believe you're correct
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
because with anything it's going to take
 
02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:48.550 align:start position:0%
some some live time to determine whether
 
02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:50.830 align:start position:0%
the program is fully operational or not
 
02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:53.710 align:start position:0%
we would probably pick a few communities
 
02:17:56.490 --> 02:17:56.500 align:start position:0%
to to try it out these are very
 
02:17:58.890 --> 02:17:58.900 align:start position:0%
complicated where we're trying to switch
 
02:18:00.959 --> 02:18:00.969 align:start position:0%
over and weights and measures right now
 
02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:02.950 align:start position:0%
this has been a process that's been
 
02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
going on for a couple of years and very
 
02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:11.050 align:start position:0%
very complicated so we anticipate
 
02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:14.170 align:start position:0%
they'll be hopefully not as complicated
 
02:18:16.379 --> 02:18:16.389 align:start position:0%
because we're creating a new program
 
02:18:18.330 --> 02:18:18.340 align:start position:0%
versus trying to swap one over but
 
02:18:20.850 --> 02:18:20.860 align:start position:0%
unless you have anything pressing for me
 
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:23.740 align:start position:0%
I do have to go and I apologize for that
 
02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:26.110 align:start position:0%
that's for your time I think I represent
 
02:18:28.890 --> 02:18:28.900 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer further questions
 
02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:31.510 align:start position:0%
I I believe he will he's been very
 
02:18:36.410 --> 02:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:38.070 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:41.830 align:start position:0%
yes we're into lunch time now is there
 
02:18:43.919 --> 02:18:43.929 align:start position:0%
anyone else who has a question I don't
 
02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:50.610 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.340 --> 02:18:59.350 align:start position:0%
okay so does anyone have any suggestions
 
02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:05.770 align:start position:0%
for different amendments or we can
 
02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:09.190 align:start position:0%
discuss actual emotions at our caucuses
 
02:19:14.970 --> 02:19:14.980 align:start position:0%
and come to the exact way then if no one
 
02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:20.530 align:start position:0%
has anything further this amendment I
 
02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:26.770 align:start position:0%
believe that we can close the work
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
session on HP 1627 Committee for all the
 
02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:38.970 align:start position:0%
hard work you've done thank you
 
02:19:44.041 --> 02:19:44.051 align:start position:0%
represented basically and we can close
 
02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:50.830 align:start position:0%
the work session yes there is nobody who
 
02:19:53.461 --> 02:19:53.471 align:start position:0%
is raising their hand for any further
 
02:19:57.001 --> 02:19:57.011 align:start position:0%
purpose so I am going to end this work
 
02:20:01.951 --> 02:20:01.961 align:start position:0%
session we will be meeting again to do
 
02:20:04.470 --> 02:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate oh sorry
 
02:20:10.051 --> 02:20:10.061 align:start position:0%
have we lost some of us it's that part
 
02:20:12.751 --> 02:20:12.761 align:start position:0%
of this the other part of this which is
 
02:20:16.171 --> 02:20:16.181 align:start position:0%
fairly small but which is why Chris Shea
 
02:20:19.350 --> 02:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
has been sitting through all of this and
 
02:20:23.371 --> 02:20:23.381 align:start position:0%
helping us out occasionally any members
 
02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:26.860 align:start position:0%
that we need to call back I'm not sure
 
02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:31.410 align:start position:0%
that anyone has left just in this moment
 
02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:33.940 align:start position:0%
we've lost one or two along the way
 
02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
today yeah question
 
02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:43.330 align:start position:0%
yes she does absent of Kamala said he'll
 
02:20:48.541 --> 02:20:48.551 align:start position:0%
come back if he can and the amendment
 
02:20:50.730 --> 02:20:50.740 align:start position:0%
for this previous film we are speaking
 
02:20:53.791 --> 02:20:53.801 align:start position:0%
of didn't have the blue things the blue
 
02:20:55.381 --> 02:20:55.391 align:start position:0%
additions on my copy
 
02:20:59.581 --> 02:20:59.591 align:start position:0%
maybe I sent it late last night to
 
02:20:59.591 --> 02:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
maybe I sent it late last night to
everybody

02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:01.250 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:21:03.090 --> 02:21:03.100 align:start position:0%
well I guess I was looking at Jennifer's
 
02:21:09.210 --> 02:21:09.220 align:start position:0%
email maybe from yeah I that went out I
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
said you just after I think you said the
 
02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:17.330 align:start position:0%
other one I've been working on things
 
02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:22.420 align:start position:0%
still quite late at night I apologize so
 
02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:28.270 align:start position:0%
we did want to briefly go through the on
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
with Chris Shea just what these new
 
02:21:34.059 --> 02:21:34.069 align:start position:0%
forms we're going to use for revenue
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
estimates are next week for any
 
02:21:39.219 --> 02:21:39.229 align:start position:0%
attendees that are listening this is
 
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:43.810 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.349 --> 02:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
no estimates they are really going to be
 
02:21:54.130 --> 02:21:54.140 align:start position:0%
a week from now so Chris can you talk to
 
02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:56.180 align:start position:0%
us yes person follow me thank you for
 
02:22:00.849 --> 02:22:00.859 align:start position:0%
that introduction so I'm the so there
 
02:22:02.679 --> 02:22:02.689 align:start position:0%
was an email as part of the email that
 
02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
you received yesterday you've got an
 
02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
Excel worksheet and I can share my
 
02:22:09.610 --> 02:22:09.620 align:start position:0%
screen to show it again to you but it's
 
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing basically the same sheet
 
02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:17.930 align:start position:0%
that is that showing up for you guys
 
02:22:22.090 --> 02:22:22.100 align:start position:0%
yes all right so it is just essentially
 
02:22:23.679 --> 02:22:23.689 align:start position:0%
the same worksheet that you've seen if
 
02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:24.590 align:start position:0%
you've been on the Ways and Means
 
02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:28.430 align:start position:0%
Committee year after year what's
 
02:22:30.190 --> 02:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
different is it we're really going to
 
02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:34.850 align:start position:0%
have a agency look ranges and then House
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Lo and hydrangeas as you
 
02:22:39.370 --> 02:22:39.380 align:start position:0%
do your estimates and that change has
 
02:22:43.179 --> 02:22:43.189 align:start position:0%
been made on each of the three tabs when
 
02:22:45.010 --> 02:22:45.020 align:start position:0%
you get I'm gonna eat email you guys
 
02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:48.430 align:start position:0%
this again Friday later in the day
 
02:22:50.650 --> 02:22:50.660 align:start position:0%
potentially Saturday and depending on
 
02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
when I get some of the agency responses
 
02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:56.270 align:start position:0%
what you will get is hopefully a
 
02:22:59.290 --> 02:22:59.300 align:start position:0%
populated worksheet on Friday for the
 
02:23:01.719 --> 02:23:01.729 align:start position:0%
agency information so that when you're
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
sitting in the meeting on the 27 you'll
 
02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
have an idea if you have this worksheet
 
02:23:08.889 --> 02:23:08.899 align:start position:0%
up what the agencies providing for
 
02:23:10.929 --> 02:23:10.939 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates or ideas for revenue
 
02:23:13.929 --> 02:23:13.939 align:start position:0%
estimates additionally I will be sending
 
02:23:13.939 --> 02:23:14.770 align:start position:0%
estimates additionally I will be sending
how

02:23:14.770 --> 02:23:14.780 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:19.130 align:start position:0%
the agency written information so you'll
 
02:23:20.650 --> 02:23:20.660 align:start position:0%
all get that as part of the email and
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
these documents will all be available on
 
02:23:24.850 --> 02:23:24.860 align:start position:0%
the general court website the day of the
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
meeting as well but reps in Vaughn we
 
02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:28.910 align:start position:0%
just wanted me to make sure that you
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
knew you're gonna get the worksheet it
 
02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:31.730 align:start position:0%
was gonna be a live Excel worksheet that
 
02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:34.610 align:start position:0%
you could select information in make
 
02:23:37.420 --> 02:23:37.430 align:start position:0%
notes in it whatever you need to do for
 
02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:39.620 align:start position:0%
each of the you know various funding
 
02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:41.390 align:start position:0%
funds that you are gonna make estimates
 
02:23:46.330 --> 02:23:46.340 align:start position:0%
on one I'm in the highway worksheet
 
02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
right now and just so you understand if
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
you were to compare the official plan of
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
259 for in column D so that was what
 
02:24:02.530 --> 02:24:02.540 align:start position:0%
your estimates were last time you did
 
02:24:04.930 --> 02:24:04.940 align:start position:0%
the revenues for the budget if you go to
 
02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:06.410 align:start position:0%
the revenue plan you're gonna see a
 
02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:11.170 align:start position:0%
number of two 27.6 that's because the
 
02:24:13.570 --> 02:24:13.580 align:start position:0%
administrative services backs out that
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
cost of collections and that's what I
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
show you in column GE I've also been
 
02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:25.190 align:start position:0%
scheduling people to present to you on
 
02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
the 27 so you're gonna start with Phil
 
02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:31.610 align:start position:0%
Slaton Hampshire fiscal policy institute
 
02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:33.950 align:start position:0%
he'll talk to you starting at 9:30 until
 
02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:36.350 align:start position:0%
about 10:00 and then from 10:00 to about
 
02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:39.710 align:start position:0%
noonish DRA will present on the various
 
02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:41.210 align:start position:0%
revenues that they are responsible for
 
02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:43.610 align:start position:0%
collecting and any information that they
 
02:24:45.370 --> 02:24:45.380 align:start position:0%
can provide the committee that might be
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
helpful around one o'clock I believe the
 
02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:52.690 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce will come on to the
 
02:24:55.690 --> 02:24:55.700 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting and there's two individuals
 
02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:57.050 align:start position:0%
that are representing the Chamber of
 
02:24:58.390 --> 02:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
Commerce that will talk about some of
 
02:25:01.450 --> 02:25:01.460 align:start position:0%
the impacts they're the businesses they
 
02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
represent or experiencing and then
 
02:25:06.490 --> 02:25:06.500 align:start position:0%
starting at 1:30 you'll have the
 
02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:08.210 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance Department
 
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:10.930 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission Lottery Commission and
 
02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:14.150 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety all doing brief
 
02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:15.890 align:start position:0%
presentations to you on their on their
 
02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:18.590 align:start position:0%
revenues and then the remaining agencies
 
02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:21.230 align:start position:0%
and I'll provide this list to you will
 
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:23.270 align:start position:0%
be available to answer questions but
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
they're not being asked to present
 
02:25:27.369 --> 02:25:27.379 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason is because of the
 
02:25:29.229 --> 02:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
the format that's being used and the
 
02:25:31.469 --> 02:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
need to kind of streamline some of the
 
02:25:34.779 --> 02:25:34.789 align:start position:0%
way to get information how we just asked
 
02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
them to be available questions if you
 
02:25:42.069 --> 02:25:42.079 align:start position:0%
receive the information Friday and
 
02:25:43.569 --> 02:25:43.579 align:start position:0%
you're looking at over you know over the
 
02:25:45.939 --> 02:25:45.949 align:start position:0%
long weekend and you start to think of
 
02:25:47.559 --> 02:25:47.569 align:start position:0%
questions as it might relate to a
 
02:25:49.569 --> 02:25:49.579 align:start position:0%
particular revenue source or or you have
 
02:25:51.939 --> 02:25:51.949 align:start position:0%
another piece of information that you're
 
02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
like oh I know agency X collects Y in
 
02:25:58.059 --> 02:25:58.069 align:start position:0%
email and then I can reach out to the
 
02:26:00.279 --> 02:26:00.289 align:start position:0%
agency and either try to get that
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
information prior to the 27th or at
 
02:26:04.210 --> 02:26:04.220 align:start position:0%
least make the agency aware that they
 
02:26:05.859 --> 02:26:05.869 align:start position:0%
may have a question coming to them so
 
02:26:07.739 --> 02:26:07.749 align:start position:0%
they they're prepared to respond to you
 
02:26:10.119 --> 02:26:10.129 align:start position:0%
again the effort is to get you as much
 
02:26:11.679 --> 02:26:11.689 align:start position:0%
of the information you need as quickly
 
02:26:13.599 --> 02:26:13.609 align:start position:0%
as we can so that you can come back on
 
02:26:15.609 --> 02:26:15.619 align:start position:0%
June 1st and and make the official
 
02:26:18.729 --> 02:26:18.739 align:start position:0%
estimates that you want that's really
 
02:26:23.219 --> 02:26:23.229 align:start position:0%
all I had and that's the question for me
 
02:26:26.559 --> 02:26:26.569 align:start position:0%
that's that's very well put thank you
 
02:26:30.659 --> 02:26:30.669 align:start position:0%
yes so you hope we're going to get them
 
02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:35.390 align:start position:0%
by Friday but it might be Saturday yes
 
02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:38.270 align:start position:0%
so I've asked agencies to provide me all
 
02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:41.180 align:start position:0%
their information by Friday the
 
02:26:42.909 --> 02:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
challenge would be what time on Friday I
 
02:26:45.039 --> 02:26:45.049 align:start position:0%
get it and when I get to update the the
 
02:26:46.539 --> 02:26:46.549 align:start position:0%
worksheet and then get it out to you
 
02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:50.060 align:start position:0%
right I will get it to you as quickly as
 
02:26:52.359 --> 02:26:52.369 align:start position:0%
I can and again it'll be a live excel
 
02:26:55.359 --> 02:26:55.369 align:start position:0%
sheet so that you can make notes you
 
02:26:57.729 --> 02:26:57.739 align:start position:0%
know put numbers in it that you might
 
02:27:00.969 --> 02:27:00.979 align:start position:0%
want to just see how they look and then
 
02:27:03.279 --> 02:27:03.289 align:start position:0%
all the supporting documents that the
 
02:27:05.319 --> 02:27:05.329 align:start position:0%
agency is providing I'll also forward to
 
02:27:07.179 --> 02:27:07.189 align:start position:0%
you at the same time just so you have an
 
02:27:10.329 --> 02:27:10.339 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at that and will you
 
02:27:15.399 --> 02:27:15.409 align:start position:0%
for those emails to us on individually
 
02:27:17.889 --> 02:27:17.899 align:start position:0%
for it every single agency that reported
 
02:27:19.599 --> 02:27:19.609 align:start position:0%
to you or are you going to combine them
 
02:27:22.239 --> 02:27:22.249 align:start position:0%
into one large document hoping just to
 
02:27:26.349 --> 02:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
send one large email thank you it'll be
 
02:27:27.789 --> 02:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
easily found you know that you'll be
 
02:27:30.179 --> 02:27:30.189 align:start position:0%
looking for a single email from from me
 
02:27:32.769 --> 02:27:32.779 align:start position:0%
we'll have everything if it's if it's
 
02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
too much information if that if the
 
02:27:37.119 --> 02:27:37.129 align:start position:0%
documents are too large for whatever
 
02:27:38.650 --> 02:27:38.660 align:start position:0%
reason maybe I need to
 
02:27:41.350 --> 02:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
get into two or three emails but I'll
 
02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:43.220 align:start position:0%
try to send them back to back to back so
 
02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:45.860 align:start position:0%
you can find everything pretty easy and
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
number things like like email one out of
 
02:27:53.801 --> 02:27:53.811 align:start position:0%
three yep yep and as I said is um you
 
02:27:57.131 --> 02:27:57.141 align:start position:0%
know my if you have any questions or for
 
02:27:58.690 --> 02:27:58.700 align:start position:0%
some reason you're not getting something
 
02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:01.610 align:start position:0%
that you thought you should feel free to
 
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:04.010 align:start position:0%
reach out to me and we'll try to get it
 
02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:08.570 align:start position:0%
resolved thank you and schanberg has a
 
02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:11.570 align:start position:0%
question or comment Oh
 
02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:14.690 align:start position:0%
Crips Chris yeah you take the general
 
02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:16.970 align:start position:0%
fund spreadsheet and break it down into
 
02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
an eight-and-a-half by eleven so I I
 
02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:22.370 align:start position:0%
will set that put the settings at eight
 
02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
and a half by eleven so if somebody
 
02:28:26.410 --> 02:28:26.420 align:start position:0%
chooses to print it it'll not cause you
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
problems thank you
 
02:28:31.091 --> 02:28:31.101 align:start position:0%
there was one technical issue that reps
 
02:28:33.250 --> 02:28:33.260 align:start position:0%
um Schamberg identified I hadn't reset
 
02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:35.930 align:start position:0%
the excel sheet to being a half by
 
02:28:38.650 --> 02:28:38.660 align:start position:0%
eleven which if different it's probably
 
02:28:42.430 --> 02:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
what you're printing yes I believe I did
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of making the columns
 
02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:49.490 align:start position:0%
narrower and in order to achieve the
 
02:28:51.881 --> 02:28:51.891 align:start position:0%
same thing it's much better if you do it
 
02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:54.110 align:start position:0%
I'm representing with Brahmi had a
 
02:29:05.890 --> 02:29:05.900 align:start position:0%
question so not every agency will give
 
02:29:06.850 --> 02:29:06.860 align:start position:0%
you a high and a low
 
02:29:08.980 --> 02:29:08.990 align:start position:0%
there are some that are doing that in
 
02:29:10.390 --> 02:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
the material I've seen some are just
 
02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
giving you a number you know they think
 
02:29:14.470 --> 02:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good idea what they think
 
02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:15.710 align:start position:0%
twenty is gonna end at and they're just
 
02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:19.010 align:start position:0%
providing a number in those cases are in
 
02:29:21.131 --> 02:29:21.141 align:start position:0%
your high and low I'll put the same
 
02:29:25.210 --> 02:29:25.220 align:start position:0%
number obviously but there are some that
 
02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:26.870 align:start position:0%
are saying that you know especially for
 
02:29:28.210 --> 02:29:28.220 align:start position:0%
twenty one if they're giving you any
 
02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:30.110 align:start position:0%
information for twenty one they're
 
02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
saying it's too early to really know
 
02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:34.910 align:start position:0%
where it's gonna land so they're giving
 
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:36.010 align:start position:0%
you a high and a low
 
02:29:41.591 --> 02:29:41.601 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we understand a major yes
 
02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
Chris to reach out to you we use your
 
02:29:50.639 --> 02:29:50.649 align:start position:0%
legislative email only yes please okay
 
02:29:56.779 --> 02:29:56.789 align:start position:0%
yes and he is available weekends as
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
necessary I wish there was a way that we
 
02:30:05.579 --> 02:30:05.589 align:start position:0%
could avoid this kind of thing but he's
 
02:30:12.209 --> 02:30:12.219 align:start position:0%
been very good about it any further
 
02:30:15.869 --> 02:30:15.879 align:start position:0%
questions or discussion about how we're
 
02:30:18.359 --> 02:30:18.369 align:start position:0%
gonna do the revenue estimates I think
 
02:30:20.099 --> 02:30:20.109 align:start position:0%
all of us have been through this before
 
02:30:22.319 --> 02:30:22.329 align:start position:0%
including Tim Lang who was on the
 
02:30:26.939 --> 02:30:26.949 align:start position:0%
committee for two terms three before he
 
02:30:30.989 --> 02:30:30.999 align:start position:0%
went off so we do have representative
 
02:30:33.689 --> 02:30:33.699 align:start position:0%
Romney raising his hand again yeah I
 
02:30:35.279 --> 02:30:35.289 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we all understand
 
02:30:39.119 --> 02:30:39.129 align:start position:0%
obviously usually go alone we talk about
 
02:30:40.679 --> 02:30:40.689 align:start position:0%
the revenues I just want to make sure I
 
02:30:45.449 --> 02:30:45.459 align:start position:0%
understand how these revenues obviously
 
02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:48.549 align:start position:0%
flying high low I guess we're going to
 
02:30:55.529 --> 02:30:55.539 align:start position:0%
do a high Lobo difficult doing it via
 
02:31:02.519 --> 02:31:02.529 align:start position:0%
zoom for some reason so yeah I think
 
02:31:05.669 --> 02:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be able to do is is
 
02:31:08.069 --> 02:31:08.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to do is just raise hands
 
02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.159 --> 02:31:17.169 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be discussing them
 
02:31:19.619 --> 02:31:19.629 align:start position:0%
which means that if you've got something
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
you want to discuss about each revenue
 
02:31:24.869 --> 02:31:24.879 align:start position:0%
as we go along you raise your hand and
 
02:31:30.119 --> 02:31:30.129 align:start position:0%
you talk and then we'll have to do a
 
02:31:32.989 --> 02:31:32.999 align:start position:0%
little talking on at least some of them
 
02:31:38.959 --> 02:31:38.969 align:start position:0%
before we try to to vote on numbers on
 
02:31:44.059 --> 02:31:44.069 align:start position:0%
the first but the idea is that we'll get
 
02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:50.310 align:start position:0%
substantial input during on the 27th and
 
02:31:55.409 --> 02:31:55.419 align:start position:0%
then each party will hold a caucus and
 
02:31:57.629 --> 02:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
discuss it further and then we'll get
 
02:32:02.249 --> 02:32:02.259 align:start position:0%
back together on the first and and do
 
02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:04.190 align:start position:0%
hopefully not
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
more conversation but there might be and
 
02:32:10.961 --> 02:32:10.971 align:start position:0%
vote on each of these by raising our
 
02:32:16.831 --> 02:32:16.841 align:start position:0%
hands unless there's some way to add the
 
02:32:21.791 --> 02:32:21.801 align:start position:0%
other hand raising version say yes no
 
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
version on to this but there probably
 
02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:28.490 align:start position:0%
isn't without a lot of trouble I'm so I
 
02:32:31.121 --> 02:32:31.131 align:start position:0%
guess I'm still muted so so we're saying
 
02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:33.921 align:start position:0%
your first yeah we we got to come in
 
02:32:35.470 --> 02:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
with there could be 20 different
 
02:32:42.001 --> 02:32:42.011 align:start position:0%
versions of this or conversion and
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
consensus or compromising those because
 
02:32:48.791 --> 02:32:48.801 align:start position:0%
they could be upwards of they could be
 
02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:10.750 align:start position:0%
upwards of 20 opinions major thank you
 
02:33:15.131 --> 02:33:15.141 align:start position:0%
after the 27th I would plan to have a
 
02:33:18.390 --> 02:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus stop talking about
 
02:33:20.650 --> 02:33:20.660 align:start position:0%
revenues the caucus I assume you're
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
gonna do the same thing yes and then so
 
02:33:28.331 --> 02:33:28.341 align:start position:0%
that we can go over it and we have
 
02:33:31.511 --> 02:33:31.521 align:start position:0%
questions as a result of what we heard
 
02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:35.660 align:start position:0%
on the 27th and discussion on the 28th
 
02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
we can get those to Chris so we can get
 
02:33:42.881 --> 02:33:42.891 align:start position:0%
the most up-to-date information and it
 
02:33:48.581 --> 02:33:48.591 align:start position:0%
probably would have another caucus prior
 
02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:52.730 align:start position:0%
to June 1st we don't have much time yeah
 
02:33:55.121 --> 02:33:55.131 align:start position:0%
we don't have much time and you you are
 
02:33:59.770 --> 02:33:59.780 align:start position:0%
busy I think all day on the 29th yes oh
 
02:34:06.461 --> 02:34:06.471 align:start position:0%
god yes we've got another problem we
 
02:34:14.711 --> 02:34:14.721 align:start position:0%
have a delegation of 90 representative
 
02:34:17.410 --> 02:34:17.420 align:start position:0%
Tucker is raising her hand physically
 
02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:21.890 align:start position:0%
so well we have to take a roll call vote
 
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:31.820 align:start position:0%
on this to take a vote buddy we're going
 
02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:35.090 align:start position:0%
to pass under this format we are
 
02:34:37.210 --> 02:34:37.220 align:start position:0%
required to take a roll
 
02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:39.500 align:start position:0%
actually you're correct I said raise
 
02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:43.270 align:start position:0%
hands on once we get to the to do first
 
02:34:45.969 --> 02:34:45.979 align:start position:0%
we're going to be having to take a roll
 
02:34:51.730 --> 02:34:51.740 align:start position:0%
call vote on every single tax or fee or
 
02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:55.250 align:start position:0%
revenue whatever it is that's right I
 
02:34:59.890 --> 02:34:59.900 align:start position:0%
assumed the case yeah just quickly to
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
point out to you if you go to I think
 
02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:07.090 align:start position:0%
it's the lower right on the Mac and
 
02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:22.450 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:26.330 align:start position:0%
the caucus I guess will come to terms
 
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
with hi-low versions appear on what Kris
 
02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
is going to present the first discussion
 
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:41.210 align:start position:0%
that day will say well you know we can
 
02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
compromise on a certain number is that
 
02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:45.740 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to envision how it's going to
 
02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:49.910 align:start position:0%
work that's the name I think we have to
 
02:35:52.450 --> 02:35:52.460 align:start position:0%
do a certain amount of discussing of
 
02:35:56.170 --> 02:35:56.180 align:start position:0%
these and not just listen to the agency
 
02:35:57.940 --> 02:35:57.950 align:start position:0%
while we're going through the revenues
 
02:36:02.370 --> 02:36:02.380 align:start position:0%
but do a certain amount of discussion if
 
02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:06.710 align:start position:0%
to see if someone has particular
 
02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:09.650 align:start position:0%
concerns from once one side on
 
02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:14.180 align:start position:0%
particular revenues and if there's any
 
02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:18.110 align:start position:0%
way that we can try to resolve them with
 
02:36:23.790 --> 02:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
Chris Shea or otherwise before the first
 
02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:27.050 align:start position:0%
we can in otherwise we're just going to
 
02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:29.490 align:start position:0%
have to we've done this in
 
02:36:32.690 --> 02:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
we've we've met in caucuses and then
 
02:36:36.171 --> 02:36:36.181 align:start position:0%
we've gotten together and we are not we
 
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily voting in caucuses
 
02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:40.670 align:start position:0%
when we when we get together again
 
02:36:45.801 --> 02:36:45.811 align:start position:0%
people listen to each other and around
 
02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:48.750 align:start position:0%
the room and usually in a straw vote
 
02:36:51.530 --> 02:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
which I guess we can't do I'm gonna have
 
02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:00.690 align:start position:0%
to ask about that and and people all of
 
02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:02.910 align:start position:0%
a sudden say well I voted this way
 
02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:04.530 align:start position:0%
differently for the rest of you because
 
02:37:14.810 --> 02:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
because this and so we we all think
 
02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:17.550 align:start position:0%
about it at that point and adjust
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
accordingly what each of us was going to
 
02:37:24.801 --> 02:37:24.811 align:start position:0%
vote vote on but we haven't I guess
 
02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:27.030 align:start position:0%
there been a few times when we have
 
02:37:30.261 --> 02:37:30.271 align:start position:0%
voted a party-line when we got to
 
02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:41.130 align:start position:0%
and other times people they've been
 
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
listening within their caucus the
 
02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:45.450 align:start position:0%
caucuses give us a chance to spend more
 
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
time talking about things it's great the
 
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:08.010 align:start position:0%
starting point is I think it's going to
 
02:38:09.650 --> 02:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
be this and sometimes usually it's only
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
five or six people who speak up but
 
02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:13.830 align:start position:0%
their idea of what a number is gonna be
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
and then we come to consensus which is
 
02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:18.750 align:start position:0%
fine it's just I just seems like it's
 
02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:19.950 align:start position:0%
giving you a harder come to consensus
 
02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:27.330 align:start position:0%
over zoom just thinking that's all it
 
02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:30.030 align:start position:0%
has to be as much as possible a public
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
process we've never really done it it's
 
02:38:35.810 --> 02:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
public process because nobody has ever
 
02:38:37.011 --> 02:38:37.021 align:start position:0%
bothered to come in to the committee
 
02:38:39.921 --> 02:38:39.931 align:start position:0%
room except occasionally a reporter who
 
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved with it but
 
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think that that we have to make a
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
start at it on the 27th we aren't just
 
02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:54.990 align:start position:0%
there on the 27th to listen to what they
 
02:38:57.381 --> 02:38:57.391 align:start position:0%
say we're there to ask questions and to
 
02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
bring up extra factors that hadn't we
 
02:39:04.690 --> 02:39:04.700 align:start position:0%
think hadn't been considered on and
 
02:39:07.551 --> 02:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can take that back to the
 
02:39:10.460 --> 02:39:10.470 align:start position:0%
two caucuses and talk about it further
 
02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:18.090 align:start position:0%
and try to to resolve some parts of the
 
02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:20.970 align:start position:0%
process and then bring it back on them
 
02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:25.710 align:start position:0%
on June 1 and discuss it publicly and
 
02:39:31.341 --> 02:39:31.351 align:start position:0%
get numbers out there represent South
 
02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:35.090 align:start position:0%
Worth has a question represent of South
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you just one idea perhaps after
 
02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
the caucuses to make it easier what if
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
each caucus had a primary spokesperson
 
02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:46.710 align:start position:0%
when you got to each section so other
 
02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:49.170 align:start position:0%
people could speak but if there's one
 
02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
person that you knew was always going to
 
02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
kind of give a little presentation from
 
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:55.470 align:start position:0%
that caucus it would go a lot more
 
02:39:57.650 --> 02:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
quickly you could still do some
 
02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:58.970 align:start position:0%
quickly you could still do some
consensus

02:39:58.970 --> 02:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:03.330 align:start position:0%
you know votes but really I just think
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we're doing it too random
 
02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
it just takes a little more time
 
02:40:09.551 --> 02:40:09.561 align:start position:0%
bouncing around and so on just at that
 
02:40:15.341 --> 02:40:15.351 align:start position:0%
it does but sometimes one person as an
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
idea as a rep said of or he did actually
 
02:40:29.841 --> 02:40:29.851 align:start position:0%
for the the electric cars problem about
 
02:40:32.631 --> 02:40:32.641 align:start position:0%
before yeah and it's important they be
 
02:40:34.850 --> 02:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
able to speak also and then it not be
 
02:40:38.091 --> 02:40:38.101 align:start position:0%
considered necessarily a caucus thing no
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
I agree with that I'm not trying to stop
 
02:40:42.470 --> 02:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm just saying to always get us
 
02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:44.910 align:start position:0%
started when you say business taxes
 
02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
there'll be a person from each caucus
 
02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:49.110 align:start position:0%
already to do a little something
 
02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:50.630 align:start position:0%
then you can add anyone else you want
 
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:54.580 align:start position:0%
okay who wants to
 
02:40:59.400 --> 02:40:59.410 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's a good idea if it's okay
 
02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:07.090 align:start position:0%
with represent major advice to remember
 
02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:09.250 align:start position:0%
of their committee just do your homework
 
02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:15.220 align:start position:0%
before the 27th review you know ask good
 
02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:17.470 align:start position:0%
questions that's what that's what we're
 
02:41:18.210 --> 02:41:18.220 align:start position:0%
here for
 
02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:23.310 align:start position:0%
get information thank you then and then
 
02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:25.870 align:start position:0%
after we get through with all the
 
02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:28.810 align:start position:0%
agencies the day after we can have our
 
02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:31.390 align:start position:0%
separate caucuses discuss these issues
 
02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:34.270 align:start position:0%
that we have and hopefully as a caucus
 
02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:38.590 align:start position:0%
come to consensus Susan and I will be
 
02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:40.750 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other the
 
02:41:43.139 --> 02:41:43.149 align:start position:0%
caucuses because she could point out
 
02:41:45.809 --> 02:41:45.819 align:start position:0%
something that we didn't consider and
 
02:41:48.059 --> 02:41:48.069 align:start position:0%
maybe I could point out something that
 
02:41:56.059 --> 02:41:56.069 align:start position:0%
they had come up with a bipartisan
 
02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:00.850 align:start position:0%
agreement right and they at least know
 
02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:03.340 align:start position:0%
places where we're gonna have to do more
 
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:06.490 align:start position:0%
discussion on the first but it's very
 
02:42:09.450 --> 02:42:09.460 align:start position:0%
important do your homework before we sit
 
02:42:12.530 --> 02:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
down on the 27th with the agencies
 
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
Thanks yeah most of us don't have a
 
02:42:18.330 --> 02:42:18.340 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day parade we can dedicate it
 
02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:19.830 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:24.550 align:start position:0%
it was just canceled this morning we
 
02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:28.030 align:start position:0%
have a small memorial event by a few
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
veterans only so okay go Marlo have
 
02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
veterans only so okay go Marlo have
questions

02:42:36.719 --> 02:42:36.729 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:42:41.219 --> 02:42:41.229 align:start position:0%
ah okay rip Centers Tucker it isn't a
 
02:42:44.250 --> 02:42:44.260 align:start position:0%
question - it's really a encouragement -
 
02:42:48.210 --> 02:42:48.220 align:start position:0%
the sooner we can set the time or the
 
02:42:55.139 --> 02:42:55.149 align:start position:0%
caucus the better right because I think
 
02:42:58.380 --> 02:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
it's very important that each group be
 
02:43:02.429 --> 02:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
able to meet isn't everyone there yes
 
02:43:05.499 --> 02:43:05.509 align:start position:0%
knowing though
 
02:43:12.229 --> 02:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever and I know your life is very
 
02:43:14.899 --> 02:43:14.909 align:start position:0%
complex your clerk could give you the
 
02:43:22.849 --> 02:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
hand or yes okay I just like to throw
 
02:43:28.039 --> 02:43:28.049 align:start position:0%
out that they I'm not sure whether all
 
02:43:30.229 --> 02:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
of our caucus members could get together
 
02:43:31.729 --> 02:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
02:43:34.699 --> 02:43:34.709 align:start position:0%
that's when Rockingham is working all
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
day long or whether you'd rather that we
 
02:43:47.119 --> 02:43:47.129 align:start position:0%
did it on Thursday or Saturday or is
 
02:43:49.879 --> 02:43:49.889 align:start position:0%
represented stream still this I can't
 
02:43:51.949 --> 02:43:51.959 align:start position:0%
see part of the screen because of the
 
02:44:02.349 --> 02:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
and raising stuff yes there you are yes
 
02:44:04.789 --> 02:44:04.799 align:start position:0%
posters as a meeting is that what you're
 
02:44:10.039 --> 02:44:10.049 align:start position:0%
saying yeah I don't know what other
 
02:44:12.889 --> 02:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
people are in for that idea or not but
 
02:44:16.729 --> 02:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
think about it in and someone will be
 
02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:18.810 align:start position:0%
contacting you fine
 
02:44:21.199 --> 02:44:21.209 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be delivering masks
 
02:44:25.369 --> 02:44:25.379 align:start position:0%
from 10:00 to 2:00 on Saturday okay that
 
02:44:28.789 --> 02:44:28.799 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good thing to do represent
 
02:44:32.959 --> 02:44:32.969 align:start position:0%
go Marla oh I was just gonna ask if
 
02:44:36.109 --> 02:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
Christmas going to do a share of that
 
02:44:39.619 --> 02:44:39.629 align:start position:0%
excel sheet and fill in the blanks like
 
02:44:43.249 --> 02:44:43.259 align:start position:0%
Willis did for us before and that would
 
02:44:46.219 --> 02:44:46.229 align:start position:0%
be very helpful so the first one you
 
02:44:47.749 --> 02:44:47.759 align:start position:0%
guys are meeting I can certainly do that
 
02:44:55.179 --> 02:44:55.189 align:start position:0%

02:44:58.729 --> 02:44:58.739 align:start position:0%

Friday
 
02:45:04.669 --> 02:45:04.679 align:start position:0%

02:45:06.169 --> 02:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
say it was a conflict I'm trying to
 
02:45:08.359 --> 02:45:08.369 align:start position:0%

caucus states on the 28th on the
 
02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:49.710 align:start position:0%
Democratic side people can spend some
 
02:46:52.341 --> 02:46:52.351 align:start position:0%
time looking at everything that we've
 
02:46:56.810 --> 02:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
got and I'm writing down so I won't
 
02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
forget it again I forgot a caucus
 
02:47:03.850 --> 02:47:03.860 align:start position:0%
yesterday on for the caucus for the 29th
 
02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:09.750 align:start position:0%
10:00 a.m. good thank you all
 
02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Kerry kisses hand oh it's Otis
 
02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
Janet Jenny first Jenny Stone has her
 
02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
hand up like 28 blue I can't be at the
 
02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
caucus on the 29th in the morning I can
 
02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:30.290 align:start position:0%
be there in the afternoon
 
02:47:34.780 --> 02:47:34.790 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll have to start at 1:00 p.m.
 
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay okay so Jenny I had except on those
 
02:47:44.841 --> 02:47:44.851 align:start position:0%
two bills on the 28th but we're gonna do
 
02:47:47.301 --> 02:47:47.311 align:start position:0%
it on the first or another it's on the
 
02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:53.970 align:start position:0%
first yeah I'm not sure I think that
 
02:47:55.970 --> 02:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
might have been under consideration at
 
02:47:59.500 --> 02:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
one point or another I think so too
 
02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:02.490 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's been very confusing I do
 
02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
apologize and we've lost the other
 
02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
person who had their hand up so I think
 
02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
that we can leave each other for the
 
02:48:16.011 --> 02:48:16.021 align:start position:0%
moment and hopefully represent a bowler
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
he can get a bite to eat before he has
