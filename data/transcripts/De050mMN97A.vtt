undischarged
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
mortgages I've handed out my written
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee and I've
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually provided an exhibit of what the
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to accomplish um what I can
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
tell you is I the conversation started
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
immediately with the New Hampshire
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
Bankers Association and worked with the
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bar Association the New
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire realators to uh get their Buy
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
in on the bill I we also reached out to
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and the
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
banking Department um the AG's office is
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
not taking an opinion however the
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
banking Department did weigh in with
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
some clarifying language in the bill
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
that I do want to bring to your
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
attention because there is a grammatical
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
error in the bill on line
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
18 the word action is missing it's
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
between the words further and the number
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
five on line 18 and when you read the
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
context of the bill you'll see that the
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
language without the necessity of any
 
00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:54.519 align:start position:0%
further action are in all three sections
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
just section three is missing that word
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
action um and I would hope that the
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate correction would be made to
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
the bill where do you want the word
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
action I'm sorry sure the word Action
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
Line 18 Mr chairman line 18 without the
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
necessity of any further five years an
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
action needs to be inserted between
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the in in brief the the
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um House Bill House Bill 437
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
seeks to shorten the amount of time it
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
takes for an undischarged mortgage to
 
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.430 align:start position:0%
takes for an undischarged mortgage to
become

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
unenforceable uh right now the statute
 
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
has a 50-year statute of limitations for
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
private mortgages the law is silent as
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
it relates
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
to public mortgages banks credit unions
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
and mortgage mortgage companies so the
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill before you uh would um replace
 
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.630 align:start position:0%
bill before you uh would um replace
section

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
47928 with completely new language the
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
language is going to mimic what the
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth of Massachusetts has
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
specifically mortgages with with an
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
expiration term or a maturity date would
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
be voided five years after the date of
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
expiration if mortgages are filed
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
without an expiration term or maturity
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
date um generally speaking in
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the law is 35 the bill
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
proposed 35 years so no expiration date
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
that mortgage would be unenforceable
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
from the date of recording plus 35 years
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the proposed law in a nutshell
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
um I have um um Michelle R coffin my
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
colleague Mary hackin Philips one of the
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and we have Susan Cole from
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
the real Association who are also going
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
to be testifying to speak firsthand
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
about some of the other problems that
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
they've experienced uh with with these
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
obsolete mortgages I've been I've been I
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
started pulling books in a registry of
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
deeds when I was 13 years old I'm 56 and
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'm still doing this line of work and
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
then this is kind of the bane of my
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
existence when I get title work down to
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I see an unenforceable
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
mortgage I can I can write it off by
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
Statute down to Massachusetts but in New
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can't I have to report that
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
um so that the conveyances and maywar to
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
do what they need to do to try and
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
remedy the issue and the te the
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
anecdotal testimony that you'll hear
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
today will amplify uh why uh this bill
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually is going to fix a problem it is
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
it's going to provide a necessary remedy
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
to um consumers and attorneys and
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
conveyancers that have had this
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
particular problem
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
with obsolete mortgages so in in
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
summation this is really it's a it's
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer bill and it'll make
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
it'll make the mortgage and conveyancing
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
Industry a little bit easier in terms of
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
how we reconcile obsolete mortgages so
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
well all that being said uh thank you
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
certainly would enjoy the opportunity to
answer

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
questions any questions see none thank
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you Mr CH okay uh
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
Phillips good morning Mr chair and
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Mary hacken
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
Phillips serving Handover and lime in
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
Grafton 12 I'm so pleased to be with you
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
today speaking as a co-sponsor in
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
437 so my day job while serving in the
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house was practicing as a
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
real estate attorney here in conquered
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and as part of the my scope of practice
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
um it included helping resolve real
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
estate titles for clients who had an
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
interest in clearing title
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
irregularities attached to their
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
properties so more often than not the
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
case originates because when you're
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
preparing to close a real estate
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
transaction an undischarged or
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
improperly discharged mortgage would pop
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
up on the title search and this is known
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
as a title
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
defect these defects or irregularities
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
trigger the need for the current owner
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the property or the title insurer to
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
go through a timec consuming practice
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
and financial expense of finding the old
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
mortgage lender and getting them to
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
complete a formal discharge that's
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
proper and then record it or in the
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
alternative it's finding an attorney
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
like myself to file a petition in court
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
to have the undischarged morgage cleared
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
or quieted from the title uh and you do
 
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
that by getting a judge's declaratory
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
order in my experience neither remedy
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
was either efficient or fast in fact the
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
latter example um when you have to hire
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
an attorney to clear title these court
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
cases take several months and thousands
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
of dollars to complete and after proper
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
notices and weeks of waiting more often
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
than not a judge would enter the order
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
discharging the old mortgage because no
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
interested party holding the old
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
mortgage came forward and no one
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
contested the actual property ownership
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
interests so it's really a one-sided
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
court case that takes a bunch of time
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really um you know have any
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
contested issues in in the court so it
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
let me just be clear it is stable work
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
for attorneys and property law but I
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
think you'd be hardpressed to find
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else who believe that they
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
benefit from this process sure it def it
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
definitely gives the actual mortgage
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
holders time to come forward and to
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
claim um that they still are holding on
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
to an unpaid loan but in my years of
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
practice I never saw that happen so um
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's why I believe that this proposed
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
statutory process for wrapping up these
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
expired mortgages and title defects can
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
be a benefit to our legal system and
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
clearing unnecessary docket clutter uh
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
and we all know that our court systems
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
could use a few more resources for you
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
know tackling the most pressing issues
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
before our state but I also believe that
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
the proposed statutory process could
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
benefit our title examination standards
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
in a way that helps home buyers and Loan
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
customers while fairly balancing those
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
interests against mortgage holders and
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
banking institutions so as a formal
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
commercial lending attorney I can also
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
speak to the perspective of lenders who
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
will need time to adjust to the proposed
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
statutory process changes that we're
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
proposing here um this law will put
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
mortgage holders on notice that they
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
must more frequently update their
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
recordings to extend a mortgage um and
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
those leans on properties but um I
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
believe you know they're going to have
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
have adequate time um to prepare and
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
then when they do have this new process
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
process they will appreciate having the
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
system in place because it will continue
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
to protect their interests as well um
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we call a
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
win-win when both parties win so for
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
these reasons Mr chair and committee I
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
urge uh your members to move a to pass
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
437 and thank you so much for your time
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
and attention if you have any questions
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer them okay I do um
 
00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:59.870 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer them okay I do um
so

00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative boy in his day job and
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
you stumble upon one of
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
these and he say oh it's past five years
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
is there I don't see that there's
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
actually notification to whoever was
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
left on the record that your your that
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
their mortgage is now going to be
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
treated as discharged even though it
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't in other words you're you're
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
talking about how it puts people on
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
notice that they need to pay attention
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
but I don't really see that language in
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
here I'm seeing is that you know it
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
could have been 10 years later and the
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
bank is probably could have been long
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
gone the people who were involv gone but
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're but there's no responsibility of
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
sending out of notice and say oh by the
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
way we just noticed this wasn't properly
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
discharged and and but under New
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law we have the right to
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
discharge it but there's no
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
notifications right am I missing
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
anything I don't see that in this bill
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
so I think we're um just talking past
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
each other a little bit about the term
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
of art under the legal system as notice
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
so we are a notice State uh which
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
requires any transactions for Real
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
Estate to be recorded at our local
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
County registry of deeds correct so
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's the actual legal notice of
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
transactions in our in our state that we
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
currently recognize so this law proposes
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that mortgage holders would have to
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
legally record more notice
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
every 5 years to extend their mortgages
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
um now in terms of the obligations of
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
mortgage holders to notify their own
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
clients of you know that they didn't do
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
it or they forgot to do the renewal uh
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
so actually I think it the interest is
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
that the obligation is on the lender to
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
to do the notice at the recording office
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying so let's say the lender
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
screwed up yeah okay and forgot to do it
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
happens quite a bit
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually so um there are it's not so the
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
banks under the bus yet well um you know
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
there some of the issue is that
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
mortgages can be reassigned as you all
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
are aware I'm sure and so um many times
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
large institutions from out of state
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
will have new assignments and not that I
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
very on timely basis for re-recording or
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
extending those mortgages so um very
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
often what happens if you're you know
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
someone in the know of how this process
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
works you can contact your lender and
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
let them know they need to re you know
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
um like update their mortgage um
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
assignments or they need to re U if
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
there's an error in the actual recording
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
they need to go back and you know take
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
corrective action and make a new
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
recording so um yes that is um it's
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
technically on the onus of the mortgage
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
holder but but as practice and many
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
people here will speak to the reality in
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
practice is that that gets delayed um
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay so what you're saying is is that if
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
if if the bank really did the mortgage
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
holder really did screw up and didn't
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
keep the keep it up they didn't keep
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
their book straight and they didn't do
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
it and then you know after the 5year
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
period 10 years later when someone wants
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
to REM you know Mor the property and
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
find this defect um they have no
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to notify the bank they
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
screwed up because at that point that
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
bank is probably already written off the
 
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
mortgage in the first place already
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
they've already done it or something
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
like that but anyways it's tough bananas
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
for them there can't there's no no they
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
have no legal right to say oh wait a
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
minute we we made a mistake us out I
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
mean they do have a legal right to
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
contest it for sure and so um that is
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
what this law would ensure is that um
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
people have lenders or mortgage holders
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
have noticed that they have a new
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to do this more timely and if
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
someone were to cont where do they have
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
that notice how would they get well
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
that's how this law would change the
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
proposed law the RSA the fact that law
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
is on the books that means they should
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
be paying attention to it yes and so but
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
but those who would contest it right so
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
if there is a bank that is holding a
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
note that is not paid in full but forgot
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
to extend their mortgage right if they
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
can contest this in court if someone
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
were trying to make a sale or you know
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
without paying the lean on on the
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
property so you know your full due
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
process rights are still available as a
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
mortgage holder as a lender you can
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
still go and you know contest the sale
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
or contest you know the right to pay off
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
the loan um th those rights don't change
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why I was saying it's a
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
win-win it just provides um both parties
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
a little more equal um share on the
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what is out on the
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
books in terms of the recording process
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
spear I am a total neoy in this area so
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
I just have a
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
question and excuse me if it's it's a
 
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.390 align:start position:0%
question and excuse me if it's it's a
dumb

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
dumb
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
question are we talking about mortgages
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
that have been paid off but they haven't
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
been cleared or are we talking about
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing mortgages that are still have
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
money on them well a little bit of both
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah really yeah so there are many um
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
instances at least in my practice that I
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
saw where private individuals or
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
institutions may have had a small
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
balance on the books but it wasn't
 
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.710 align:start position:0%
balance on the books but it wasn't
really

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
worth uh the the legal ramifications to
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
go through another recording or actually
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
fully discharge
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
um the loan in some cases the mortgage
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
so um but there are also instances where
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
the loans were totally paid off but
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
because of like um for instance the 2008
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
2009 Financial um crisis Across America
 
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.750 align:start position:0%
2009 Financial um crisis Across America
many

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
institutions um traded hands were
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and you know those assets
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
were all moved around and mortgages got
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
you know the paperwork got disrupted and
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
so it was never discharged even though
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
someone had paid the loan in full but it
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
was a new ownership interest and they
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the correct procedure for
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
whatever reason so it can be it can be
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
both okay representative M um correct me
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong if if let's say a mortgage
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
was a 10-year mortgage um five years
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
beyond that though is not contestable by
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
the the bank that's the way I read
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
this no I I don't believe that is right
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
um so if a if a loan is not paid off and
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
the mor mortgage is not discharged the
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
mortgage the lean remains on the
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
property but once F I like five years
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
passed oh under under the new proposal
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes um it would be deemed expired so I'm
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
sorry if I didn't okay you're asking
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
about current law thank you yep
 
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
about current law thank you yep
representative

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify uh this morning um
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
so um I had a mortgage that I paid off
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
long ago and it had been transferred to
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
a bank in Florida um that had no
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of New Hampshire law um
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
and I do not know whether um the bank
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
ever recorded the fact that I paid it
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
off but under this uh bill it is the
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
bank's responsibility to record the fact
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
that the mortgage has been paid yes that
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
is correct M thank you
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
m thank you very much thank you for your
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
Cuffin good morning good morning thank
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you members of the
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee I really am grateful to have
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak to you today
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill for me um
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
and I really want to touch upon
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
something after the last testimony what
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to do is is a little bit
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
different than what we're sort of
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
focusing on at the moment often times
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
99% of the time what happens when you're
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
doing a let me give you sorry a little
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
bit of background I owned a title
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
company and conquered New Hampshire for
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
18 years I have been in uh the real
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
estate industry since
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
1989 and I'm now a title insurance
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
underwriter I've also been bitten by
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
this twice and have had to have two
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
Quiet Title actions um at the time I did
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
them they were 5,000 and now it's about
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
10,000 $8 to $10,000 hire an attorney
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
for quiet title action what we're really
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
seeking to resolve here is a little bit
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
different it is that usually what
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
happens in the course of a title search
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
when someone's either selling their
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
property um the buyer's lender is going
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
to require a title search uh the title
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
insurance company that's going to be
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
writing the policy for the lender and
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
the buyer is going to require a title
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
search when you're refinancing the
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
lender is going to require a title
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
search during the course of that title
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
search you'll see a mortgage that's on
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
record that has not been discharged or
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
has been incorrectly discharged by the
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
wrong entity right and so these
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
mortgages you know that they've been
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
paid they're so old um uh their their
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
mortgages that have been on record if
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
the lender had any sort of a uh you know
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
payment due by this time typically they
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
would have filed a foreclosure action
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
and so these mortgages are obsolete
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're ancient they're old they should
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
have been discharged but the correct um
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
entity to discharge them oftentimes is
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
no longer in existence and if an entity
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
that discharged it was the as KN well
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's a missing assignment and the
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
assignment needs to come from that
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
lender who held the mortgage who is now
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
no longer in business right and so we're
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
seeing I'm seeing constantly the the
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
biggest title defect I see as a title
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
insurance underwriter and I saw in my 18
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
years of owning a title company were UND
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
charged mortgages that were clearly paid
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about that and if that
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
something has been paid and there's
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
unjust enrichment the bank has an
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to file a petition in equity
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know that's not what this is seeking
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
to to do this is seeking to clear up the
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
clouds upon many people's title and
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the consumer of
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
mortgages in real estate right so we're
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
trying to clear this up because it is
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
extremely costly to go and hire an
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
attorney to do a quiet title action for
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
something that should just be
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
automatically discharged after a certain
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
period of time that's what we're hoping
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
to do here that is what we are hoping to
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
rectify and really I've said this before
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
I've have I've sent you all testimony
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I highly encourage you to read some
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
of the online testimony if you haven't
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
already particularly the attorney who
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
had to do my quiet title action Patrick
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
mcnicholas who was supposed to be here
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
to testify today but is in Florida where
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's warm lucky him um and uh Gary
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
Bernier uh I would encourage you to read
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
their testimony uh because it's actually
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
fantastic and and and um I think it
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
really gets the point across of what
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here but this is a
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
consumer bill that is just a consumer

Cole realy in Lev in New Hampshire I'm
 
00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519 align:start position:0%
also the 2025 president of the New
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
Realtors are supportive of House Bill
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
437 as a realtor I've seen the
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
challenges that some borrowers face when
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
attempting to obtain a timely and
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
accurate mortgage discharge during a
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
title examination we do see fortunately
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
too often an undischarged mortgage
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes the mortgage has been paid off
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
but the bank either has not issued the
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
discharge or it has not been recorded
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
the current process the consumers must
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
go through when a mortgage was not
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
discharged properly can be burdensome
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
cause unnecessary delays and at times
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
become costly placing unnecessary
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
hardship on responsible homeowners
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
addressing these issues will provide
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
much needed relief to homeowners
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
streamline real real estate transactions
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
and ensure a fair and transparent
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
process for all parties involved
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
mortgage discharges should not be a
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
source of stress or financial burden for
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners who have fulfilled their
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
obligations I have clients um that have
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
experienced this issue themselves
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
recently I had a seller who was selling
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
a home that had been in the family for
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
many years um multiple Generations at
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
some point in that chain there was a
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
mortgage that was was not um correctly
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
discharged and we had to go through
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was uh we went through
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
all of the contingencies within the
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
contract the buyer was very excited to
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
proceed this was found on the title
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
examination and in the state of New
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the sellers are given 30 days
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
as part of the contract to repair and
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
remediate uh a title issue something
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
like this that requires quiet title is
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
takes much longer than that so at the
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
end of that 30 days this particular
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
buyer decided I don't I'm not sure how
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
long this might take they decided to
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
terminate the contract for my seller who
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
then had to continue to march on to try
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
to get this quiet title remedied um it
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
was a lot of expense um for attorney
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
fees the time not to mention the
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
emotional turmoil that that caused them
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
the buyer meanwhile moved on after a
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
couple of months I reached out to the
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
buyer's agent and said okay we've got
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
the clear um title the title issues been
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
remedied the buyer said okay I I'll come
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
back I'll resubmit an offer guess what
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
that meant for the buyer the buyer then
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
had to start from the beginning redo the
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
appraisal and start those uh that
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
Financial um obligation to get their
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
loan satisfied started over essentially
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
so both the seller and the buyer
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
incurred EX extens of expenses that
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
should not have been necessary in this
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
situation it clearly had been paid off
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
they just didn't have what was recorded
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
properly so the time the aggravation the
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
cost this should be something that's
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
addressed for the consumers of our state
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 721
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
FN um the golden silver legal tender Act
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I passed around um just
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
some graphics and and what not but um I
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
just want to say that this bill is a
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan economic Justice bill which
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
will help everyone even people with
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
little or no means to hold their wealth
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
and be a hedge against uh inflation what
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
I mean by um it's bipartisan just a
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
historical note that in
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
1896 the um the Democrat the Democratic
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
party platform Foundation was a a gold
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
based Foundation they were their
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
nickname was literally the gold
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
Democrats um because they were Jeff
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
Jeffersonian and they were for the gold
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
standard uh so just keep that in mind
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
please be open-minded about the bill um
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's not uh for one party or the other
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
but the big reason for passing
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
legislation like this which would um
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
establish golden Silver's legal tender
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
is basically there three T's trust taxes
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
and taking and we want to address those
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
um with this sort of
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
legislation um for trust that gold is is
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
very trustworthy it is known as a hedge
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
against inflation it is actually um
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
according to the banking industry a tier
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
one asset established in 2019 they
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
established gold as a tier one asset um
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
so it is not um sort of a relic of the
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
past um and a lot of of states are going
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
towards this legislation they're
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
actually expanding on this is just a
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
basic definition but there as you've
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
known from representative ammon's um
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
bills in the past that it is becoming um
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
more of a a platform a banking platform
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh to use gold and
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
silver um and then we have taxes um and
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
I've at the bottom of your sheet I've
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
listed some um taxes how tax structures
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
work in the in our neighboring
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
states um Maine and Vermont just tax
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
gold and
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
silver regardless of of any of any um
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
sort of um thresholds in
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they if you are trading
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
and buying gold um for more than
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
$1,000 then uh you are exempt from from
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
taxes but under a th000 then uh um you
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
have to pay the sales tax and that is
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
because as you probably heard before
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
gold and silver coins are considered
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
collectible and they're not considered
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
money even the US minted coins because
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
they have like an intrinsic value that
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
is over their face value um and so that
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
is shocking to some people that think
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
that it is um that is real money but it
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
is not considered um actual money by the
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
IRS or some States obviously uh so you
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay taxes on your money um so
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing we can't get away
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
from with the federal government at this
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
point although I hear that there is
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
legislation to establish a
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
minimum um so that if you're you're
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
buying and selling in small amounts that
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
you would be exempt um but
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
um we want to establish what you know
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
um you know right now we're not taxing
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
gold and silver and we're not we we
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't um but you know in the case that
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
we do establish the sales tax at some
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
point in the future I think this
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
exception is there something
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
wrong you try to shock
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you sometimes in the
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
future there may be you know God forbid
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
we have a sales tax um this could be a
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
carve out so that we don't end up like
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Main in Vermont um where
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
it's there's there's sales tax they tax
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
it like any other consumable
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
item um okay so and then as far as the
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
taking um you know on April 5th 1933 FDR
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
told Americans in the form of executive
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
order 6102 that that they had less than
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
a month to hand over their gold coins
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
bullion and gold certificates or face up
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
to 10 years in prison or a fine of
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um God forbid that happens again
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
but this is a sort of thing where we
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
want to reinstate we want to um you know
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
make a declaration that we see gold and
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
silver as legal
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
tender um so it's a constitu
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue um um it's also a
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
hedge against
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
cbdcs um and it would promote Financial
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
Independence um where I see this going
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
is you know look at the map here that
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
I've I've given you all the lighter
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
colored States either have passed gold
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
or silver legislation or it's pending
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's enormously popular now throughout
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
all the states Utah is even considering
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
that so Utah's done a study Florida has
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
a big study going about uh gold and
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
silver legislation Utah is actually
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
considering paying its state employees
 
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.790 align:start position:0%
considering paying its state employees
with

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
Golds and
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
um uh you know they they're Florida and
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
is considering using up so in Texas they
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
have a depository as you well know from
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative ammon's bills in the past
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you know and that is state-owned or
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
state sanctioned in Florida they're
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
considering a third party uh custodian
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
of their banking their gold and silver
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
banking I think they're going to use
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
Brinks and Brinks has agreed to um sort
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
of be the custodian and do the business
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
end of things um and that's where I hope
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
to see this going in the
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
future um this is sort of the Florida
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
latest legislation to deal with all the
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh definitions and transactional pieces
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
here um but right now I mean I'm kind of
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
hoping that the committee will see fit
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
to at least declare gold and silver
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
legal tender and I realize so there's a
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
part in the
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill you know and it says gold and
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
silver is legal tender for all
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
transactions um in order to use gold and
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
silver um the buyer and seller must
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
agree to a fair market value so I put
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
this in um and I have since learned a
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
lot more about it um mostly what people
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
are doing is using these if you look at
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
your page there's two like credit cards
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
down here so this can easily be I I made
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
my my I made an account myself you can
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
make these accounts you can buy gold and
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
silver um it's super easy to do I just
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
did it yesterday in fact and there's a
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
GL there's an app called a glint app
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
glint card and this is
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
actually a vault in Switzerland so you
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
buy you you know I just bought $50 worth
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
of gold um you can you and they're going
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
to send me a credit card and it's almost
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
free and you use use it like it's a
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
debit card so you just use it anywhere
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
like a debit card so I don't know if the
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee is open to hopefully um
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
putting in this sort of
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
um language about declaring golden
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
silver legal tender for all
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
transactions um possibly they you want
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the part about coins
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
because this isn't the future of using
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
gold and silver is in these apps and in
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
these credit cards where it's held you
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
can monitor you could buy small amounts
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
you can add to it it's very versatile
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's accepted everywhere everywhere like
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
a Visa card is um and that way and the
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of this is you know you you
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
could buy your gold in times of uh
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
volatility and high
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
inflation you can put some you can put
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
your cash in this and it's it's over the
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
long run it's as stable as gold is which
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
is a great store of value just a quick
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
um little anecdote about
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
inflation um during the Biden years you
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
know we went up to 8% inflation which
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
was horrifying to a lot of us um and we
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know where that was going to go
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people who had cash in the
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
bank were looking for like what what
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
where do I put my money here because I
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't know how how much longer this uh
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
inflation is going to go on so so you
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
know my family we decided to buy a
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
tractor and we're not Farmers or
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
anything but we could use the tractor so
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
um that's what we did and there was a a
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
a waiting lot everybody else was also
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
thinking that this was a great idea
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
because they were there was quite a
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
weight for the
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
tractor um and I was talking to
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bean also from belnap
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
County and we were talking about the bad
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
inflation and he said I didn't know what
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
to do this inflation is is alarming and
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
when we went and bought a
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
tractor and um yeah and he's not a
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
farmer either I was talking to another
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
state representative about this was over
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
a year ago during our high inflationary
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
period uh from the dairy area um and she
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
said her and her husband had just bought
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
a an excavator or tractor I forget which
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
it was was a piece of heavy equipment um
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
so this is what people are doing to to
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
run away from high volatility inflation
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
whatnot and I'm you know hopefully we
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
won't see that sort of 8% crazy runaway
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
inflation again uh but it's going to
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
come back and someday we'll have that um
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
but instead of buying tractors you know
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is this is a a good investment this
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
is a good Financial tool for everyone
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
people can instead of buying um tractors
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
or thinking about buying gold coins
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
which I thought about buying gold coins
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
but you have to work about them being
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
real and um you have to worry about um
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
theft and storage um and then they're
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
not exactly easy to break into smaller
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
denominations you know you have to spend
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of money for that um so that's
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
where I'm you know when I think about
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
using and having like uh people paying
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
their property taxes with gold and
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
silver I'm not thinking about they're
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
going to take a sack of gold to um the
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
Town Clerk and say here you go and then
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
forcing the town clerk to you know Chomp
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
down on the gold and see if it's real or
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
not I this is this is the future of gold
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
and silver
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
usages um through these through these
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
digital platforms so with that I'm um um
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
here okay so uh we are sure on time here
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
I I was kind of hoping this was going to
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
be a quickie but so let's not ask too
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
many questions but if you really got a
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
specific you know that you can Target
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
into so representative Sal you have a
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
question thanks for taking my question
 
00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:41.079 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions I'll make the
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
first one quick is this currently
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
illegal now if somebody I mean is there
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
a ban for somebody to to willing parties
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
to exchange in gold or
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
silver like I mean is there Outlaw it's
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
outlawed right now is what you're
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
telling me no I mean I'm not saying it's
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
outlawed it's um thank you for the
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
question it's um it's it's the the
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
classification by the IRS that gold and
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
silver is not it's a
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
collectable um in it's tax that's a
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
federal federal that's a federal thing
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.470 align:start position:0%
federal federal that's a federal thing
and

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
so you know the danger is we we don't
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
really have a classification as far as
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned here in New Hampshire for
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
it and so that is why I wanted to codify
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
it and classify it as such um sort of
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
going forward to protect and to
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
reestablish that we
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
can um establish you know go forward and
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
and for possibly explore things like
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
they've done in Utah Florida and all
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
these other
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
states um to expand upon gold and silver
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
as legal tender and if if the treasury
 
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
is holding gold and silver as legal
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
tender you know I'm kind of
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
investigating this but I don't know FDR
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
I I've heard that FDR did not confiscate
 
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.589 align:start position:0%
I I've heard that FDR did not confiscate
States

00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
gold in still silver stores back in the
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
30s but I'm still looking into that if
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's true we want to we want to come
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
out and um declare it legal T further
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
question really quick further question
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
me inquire you you have this picture
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
here of the Visa card or Master Card
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's backed by gold so I'm
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
assuming if like these are already in
 
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.390 align:start position:0%
assuming if like these are already in
existence

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
existence
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this might not be
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
necessary because if I have a Visa card
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
that is backed by gold I can presumably
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
you say you have one now use it now to
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
go buy something at Walmart or wherever
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
um so right it it seems this seems
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and I don't understand what
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
problem this is actually solving so am I
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
missing something with that because you
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
said this is the future but it sounds
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
like the future's already
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
here right thank you for the question um
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
it it I mean practically speaking it
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change anything from you know
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
we passed it right now to the next year
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
um except for the trust
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
piece and the idea that you know
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
possibly we're we're having the
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
treasurer hold gold and silver as as an
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
asset for two and possibly the idea of
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
bartering and whatnot and the other
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
thing about sales taxes I mean again
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's something that possibly in the
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
future we'd have a sales tax and then
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
this would be a carve out so that you
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tax everything at long
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's where I'm going with
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay any other
 
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.870 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay any other
representative

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't really understand this bill
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to tell you why I'll try
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
and be as brief as I can we will have a
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we can get into the
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
detail so if you want to keep it at a
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
very high level you know but I I think
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
she's going to I'll keep it as brief as
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
I can I can reach out to you too
 
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
represent um okay I understand about
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
holding gold my father did it but not as
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
a hedge against inflation he did it
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
because he and his parents were refugees
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
from the Holocaust um okay so that's a
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
would you believe question that's that's
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
not okay she's not really answering that
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
what is the specific question about the
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill that you want we have a lot of
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
people we got I'm I'm sorry I screwed up
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
I have too many bills today so I I'm
 
00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:25.799 align:start position:0%
really really if it's going to be a high
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know kind of my point is I don't
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
understand why I'm trying to explain why
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
I don't understand
 
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.670 align:start position:0%
I don't understand
why

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's fine we we we get it
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's a would you believe question yeah
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
okay may I proceed Mr
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair shall I proceed I I think I think
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
you asked your you made your point you
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
don't understand the purpose of the bill
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
and she's just going to repeat I don't
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
understand why I understand like I
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
understand but she's just going to
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
repeat what her testim I don't think
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's any new thing that going to do
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
to highlight for you I'm sorry I can't
 
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.789 align:start position:0%
to highlight for you I'm sorry I can't
hear

00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
you I think I I'm trying to just move
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
this this hearing along okay bear with
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
me on this one well it just seems
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly cumbersome and it doesn't
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
make sense to me and would you believe
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
well I'm trying to ask you why would
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
just exactly would you believe that's
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
credibly csome that's your ask that's
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
your question and she doesn't have to
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
answer the question because she doesn't
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
really want to go through the thing all
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
over again well I wish you would we will
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
do that in
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee all right represent
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hammond thank you for letting me ask a
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
very quick question um I guess it's a
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe when we started
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
talking about this two years ago gold
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
was $1,900 now it's $22,900 so it's gone
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
up 50% just in a few years we've been
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
this it's not because the gold has
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
changed it's because too much money was
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
printed so if I hold an ounce of gold I
 
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
bought it for 19900 it goes up to 2,900
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
and I sell it I have to pay capital
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
gains on
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
$1,000 but it's not really gains it's uh
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm holding value and the the value of
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
the money has gone down and yet I'm
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
taxed on that g on that supposed gain so
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
if States declared at legal tender it
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
would eliminate that tax if the federal
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
government would would respond respond
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
to the state's prompting so would you
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
believe that that would be my
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
explanation for why the bill might be a
 
00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:34.510 align:start position:0%
explanation for why the bill might be a
good

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
idea I know I know representative hunt
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't want me to say anything no you
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
could say yes I totally agree thank you
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
very much representative Ammon if it's
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
also a hedge against if all the states
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
are going towards this adoption of of um
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
legal tender and pursuing these other
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
means of bringing gold into their
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
economies then it's a competition for
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve and also yes it is
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
not that the gold is going up but the
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
dollar is not holding its value perfect
 
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.789 align:start position:0%
dollar is not holding its value perfect
answer

00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair would you
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
consider uh prior to our subcommittee
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
meeting making an amendment so that you
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
go beyond the description of coin or bar
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
form since you're already talking about
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
cards credit cards and I know that gold
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
also comes in like a foil
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes form as well so that's it exactly I
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
was thinking along the same lines it
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
probably needs an amendment but that's
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
what OSS kind of bump through towards me
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
sorry for being so Rush about that okay
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank okay uh chair we'll call on sarin
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
Association he good morning my name is
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
Sarah Burke Cohen I represent the New
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
Association the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
Association opposes this bill um as it
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
is written if it gold and silver could
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
become legal tender although I
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor discussion about
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
using Visa cards if gold and silver as
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
written becomes legal tender then people
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
could bring their gold or silver to um a
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
town clerk's office to pay their um
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
property taxes municipalities aren't set
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
up for security for gold and silver um
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
nor are they set up to um be
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
metallurgist and determine um the sort
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the grade of gold and silver um it's
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
impractical for both parties um in this
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance for with regard to
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so I'm going to keep
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
it real short representative hunt New
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association opposes
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
a spill I'm open for
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay so you're pointing out
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
that where it has the definition of
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
legal tender it just talks about um is
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by the buyer and seller but
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
not as as is that the town is being
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
forced to take it as as right even if
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's agreed upon because of the
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
volatility of gold that um
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
representative Aman uh spoke about the
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
municipality could take gold and perhaps
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
it would go up or perhaps it would go
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
down so between the time it would secure
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
it in a vault that it doesn't have
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
currently and then bring it to to sell
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
or however it disposes of it okay
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
representa spe
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
just thank you just based on what you
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
just said would the municipalities have
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
any way to establish an exchange rate
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
since you have to report budgets and
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
dollars and things like that and pay
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
salaries and dollars would you have any
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
way to even ex uh establish an exchange
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
rate I I I wouldn't know the answer to
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
that but my conjecture would be probably
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
hos turn so you had to push your mic yep
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay good morning joar from
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
gilmington uh I was uh just like the
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative over here wondering what
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
this bill was and I'm glad I listened to
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
it and I do have a few comments and one
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
of them to start off is the last speaker
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
on the nhma of the uh municipalities
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
having to restructure their system I
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
will remind her if she hasn't read it
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
before and you all too you you take an
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
oath of office to abide by the
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution and in New Hampshire it's
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
article 97 the value of money how
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
computed and when you look at The
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
annotation it goes to the state versus
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
Fleming case I learned this from dick
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
marel as you know Mr
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I was for him too what's
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah I was here when he put this
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill in yes and uh I went to archives
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
and I researched that it said that the
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consented to the coinage
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
act of 1792 in
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
1794 uh it's in chapter 28 of the laws
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Volume 7 uh no volume 6
 
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.109 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Volume 7 uh no volume 6
page

00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
155 so if you all want to read that I
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
mean even Bill Burns there was a front
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
page story in the union Le back in the
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
1980s he said that that's what he wants
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
to pay the town and the town is not
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
cooperating so he's not going to pay
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
anything but you know what I say in that
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
you put the money in the bank and dare
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
the town to take it under RSA 80 colon 2
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
distraint and I did that in bosquin I
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
dared them they never took it so then
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
they took my property uh by tax deed and
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
that's being contested in the courts
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
well the courts Superior Court if you
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
want to read it ha versus Mar uh town of
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
Bosa Incorporated but what I wanted to
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
get at is I was over in May it's not a
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
federal issue only it's over in Maine I
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
went to a coin shop and I you know

00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee n Grace for the business and
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
industry Association Statewide chamber
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce uh we do oppose this
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um mainly because it's
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
unclear if businesses can refuse payment
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
in um coin or bars of gold and silver um
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be able to do so if this is
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to legalize uh gold and
 
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
silver um basically because our econom
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
is really not set up at this point in
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
time for acceptance and trade of of gold
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
and silver and I understand that's the
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
intent of this but um realistically many
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
of our businesses do business out of
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
state um they're going to need to
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
convert this to cash it appears that
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
agreeing on the fair market value involv
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
some conversion to US Dollars um and it
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
would simply be easier for us to if they
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
want to continue using US dollars so
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
that's the basis for objection happy to
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
take any questions the committee may
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much thank you uh
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
and open up the public hearing on
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
454 um I spoke to the
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the sponsor was unable to
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
come in today because he uh has to work
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh he his comment to me was well I know
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
you'll just kill the bill so that we
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't really know big deal and I told
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
him no um that uh this committee has in
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the past past
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
historically uh always kept a bill that
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
was an issue that was hanging out there
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we would want to send the message
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
that we certainly hope we don't need to
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
pass such a bill and the best way for us
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
to do that is to retain the bill and
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
hold on to it and just keep an eye on
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
the marketplace assuming that nothing
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
funky happens in the marketplace and
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
um that that this product appears that
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
um at this point this is an old issue uh
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
we've had legislation in the past but I
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
think by retaining this bill um we will
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
hope that we won't see this
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
problem so having said that is there
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
anybody feel compelled to
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
testify seeing none perfect thank you
 
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.190 align:start position:0%
testify seeing none perfect thank you
very

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
much we close the public caring on 454
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
the next bill is House Bill 517

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
to give give you just a quick brief
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
history because I think for those of you
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
who weren't around when it was
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
implemented uh the history of this uh
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
issue has been going on for a very long
 
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
time um during my second term I uh I was
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
on labor for three terms and during my
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
second term Senator feltus actually
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill that would have
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
implemented a .5% tax on all wages
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
within the state although he didn't call
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
it a tax
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
um that would have forced every New
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employee to pay into the
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
system um that was not well received but
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
when the option of opt into a system
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary system was suggested it was uh
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
near universally agreed that the only
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
way to make a Statewide fmli system work
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
was by forcing everybody in the state to
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
contribute that was uh ultimately failed
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
then we moved up to uh would have been
 
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.829 align:start position:0%
then we moved up to uh would have been
in

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
2021 uh when the current program was
 
01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:34.910 align:start position:0%
2021 uh when the current program was
brought

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
brought
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
forward um for those that were here you
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
might remember what actually happened
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
fmli uh the house uh we were against it
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
but it was being pushed by then Governor
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
sununu um what happened was this fmli
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
program was snuck into hb2 two during
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
the committee of con conference in
 
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
2021 Against The Specific Instructions
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
of house leadership at that time I was a
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
senior adviser in house leadership and
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
also a member of the committee of
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
conference um long story there that
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
stunt resulted in the chairman uh the
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
chairwoman of Finance actually being
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
removed under threat that the hb2 would
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
not get
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
passed that was done uh a little bit
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
after that and she resigned from the
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
house The house's position on fmli has
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
been consistently against the program
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
because it's not a fiscally Republican
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
idea I will see uh say on that
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.269 align:start position:0%
idea I will see uh say on that
hb2

01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
um in my five terms on the in the house
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
I've not voted on Two Bills in that in
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
my entire time here one because I was
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
introducing a bill in the Senate the
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
other one because even though I was a
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
member of leadership and expected to
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
vote for hp2 I refused to vote for hp2
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
solely for the reason that FMI had been
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
snuck into
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
it as I said FM certainly not a
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
republican issue after it passed it was
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hush Hush nobody ran on it in their
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
campaigns no Republicans ran on it uh
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
the governor the Senate speaker
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
everybody was kind of crush hush hush
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that is because it's not a
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
republican issue it in fact to social
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
entitlement the first attempt to repeal
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
was in 2022 and that was before it was
 
01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
up and running the house passed it the
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
Senate killed it because at the time it
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
was the governor's
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
program so here we are again and
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully for the last time so what what
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
actually was the result of the fmly
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
program so what it did is it instituted
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
a law yet or into law yet another in
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
Social entitlement program the biggest
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
sing single issue is that all the state
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
employees 5,000 uh 10,500 at the time
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
were given this fmli to them without
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations at taxpayer expense in
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
other words everybody here or any
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody who pays taxes in New
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
funding this program for 10,500
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh state employees at taxpayer expense
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
the reason that was done is they needed
 
01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
to create a a a base pool otherwise the
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
program could have never got off the
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
ground what's happened since then is
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
other public sector unions or what I I
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
predicted what would happen would be
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
other public sector unions would demand
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
the same kind of a deal uh that because
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
the state workers would given the
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
program for nothing um for the fmli
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
actually turns into a public sector and
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
employment uh employee entitlement plan
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
paid for by the taxpayers and actually
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'll get into some numbers but that is
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
actually starting to happen uh the some
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
of the data I got through a 91a request
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
says 23 public employers have actually
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
program um I will be passing out a
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
very detailed package for everybody and
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's got a lot more information and I'm
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
not going to go through the 23 public
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
employers that have actually signed up
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
for it yet I will say one thing I'm not
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
I haven't been able to determine in
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
these these PL uh public employers
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not the taxpayers paying for
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
it or the individuals within the
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
Public's um employee groups are paying
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
that has not been determined but we do
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
know 10,500 state employees are having
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
their uh fmli Insurance paid for by the
 
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.589 align:start position:0%
their uh fmli Insurance paid for by the
taxpayers

01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
so why is fmll failing I I know you'll
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
hear testifying uh that we'll say it's
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
not I I can guarantee you uh with the
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm going to give you it'll
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
prove that it is in fact is failing
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
um during some of my previous testimony
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
I stated that private employers are not
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to pay premiums for
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
employees and incentivize their
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
employees not to work and the re recent
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
covid experience was a prime example of
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
that we have a very high very low
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and businesses are
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
unable to find working workers as it is
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
why would an employer pay for a program
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
private employer pay for a program that
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
gives his
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
employee um P paid time
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
off and many employers already offer
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
some form of a paid leave or a
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
combination of personal days sick days
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
vacation days so they don't need
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
fmli so here are the numbers
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
this was received from the Department of
 
01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
administrative services this past
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
December so
 
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
10,500 now keep in mind this program's
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
been up and running now for three
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
years number of state employees paid for
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire taxpayers
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
10,500 public sector employees that are
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
part of the plan
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
244 private employees and EMP or
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
employers and employees 276 six
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
employers for a grant total of
 
01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.870 align:start position:0%
employers for a grant total of
5,800

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
5,800
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
employees private individuals
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
1152 now the state has a total employed
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
of somewhere around
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
753 th000
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
people the private individuals which was
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
fmli they wanted they used the base of
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
the state tax uh the state employees to
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
get private employers and private
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
employees to sign
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
up after 3
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
years the total
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
program less than 2.5% of the state's
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
employees are covered by this
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
1.4% now state employees I'm sorry 1.4%
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
the private employees less than 1% less
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
than 1% of this the state after a total
 
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
years costs well the original uh RFP to
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
get the program up and running $1.9
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
million advertising alone $1.9 million
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sure many of you have heard ads on
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
the uh radios talking about this and
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere around $2 million annually uh
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
for the unnegotiable
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
benefit for the state
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
employees for the 1100 IND individuals
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
private sector that they've enrolled so
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
far just on the advertisement and and
 
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.510 align:start position:0%
far just on the advertisement and and
getting

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
this program up and
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
running works out to about $3,300 per
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
employee that's a heck of a lot of money
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
to spend on a program um to get
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
1152 private sector
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
employees into a
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
program going
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
forward private insurance already exists
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
for those who want it and that's called
 
01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:38.590 align:start position:0%
for those who want it and that's called
short-term

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
disability the other option employees
 
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
disability the other option employees
can

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
self-insure this requires savings and
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal dis discipline but uh for many I
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
guess it's easier to get somebody else
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
to pay for it and that's what this fmli
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
program has
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
become my favorite option would be to
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
Simply remove all the taxpayer funding
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
for the state employees let them pay for
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
it if they want it but again as I
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned before this won't work because
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
that would be an opt opt-in si uh system
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
and without forced taxpayer involvement
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
it simply won't work and that leads us
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
to the best and fiscally and most
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
fiscally sane option and that is simply
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
to kill a program and get the taxpayers
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
fully off the hook for this
 
01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.790 align:start position:0%
fully off the hook for this
entitlement

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
program going to conclude with just a
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
couple more
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
points something to keep in
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
mind um I don't know how many online
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
support or against you've seen on this
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
but I can I can tell you from recent
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
experience that those who are talking
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
about this many of them I'll use the
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
word ignorant because they're not dumb
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
they're not stupid but they're ignorant
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
of what the actual FMLA
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
is and I'm going to give you the example
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
that I got into a discussion with on a
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
Our Town Facebook page theyve in the
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
individual said how can you dare remove
 
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.189 align:start position:0%
individual said how can you dare remove
this

01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
program if as my husband experience
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
during covid he was out of work for six
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
weeks without this fmli program we would
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
have not had the money to sustain our
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
food our
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
housing and I said well there's only a
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
one little problem with this fmli was
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
know and she goes well my husband my
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
husband actually received benefits I go
 
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
well who did your husband work for if
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
he's under
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
fmli and at that point she decided to
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
depart the conversation well it was
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
discovered what she was actually talking
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
about was unemployment
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
insurance so uh I would just caution um
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
when you hear individuals talking about
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
this program it's a very detailed
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
program I've been dealing it with it
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
since the felus days along with uh is it
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
full commissioner labors now or it's
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
Deputy I know Deputy
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
Commissioners since 2017 2018 so
 
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
um again the only way you make a program
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
like this is to either Force everybody
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
in uh the op just don't simply don't
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
work um the the packet I'm going to hand
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
out has a lot several past news articles
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
in it uh they're in chronic
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
chronological order so you can see the
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
progression um I'll call it the hopes
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
and dreams of many and how this was
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a great system and it's
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a total failure
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we also note that any testimony you
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
hear today from the deputy commiss or
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
any employee of uh any of these
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
departments is currently covered by this
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
mind exec one of the quotes I found in
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
here from executive counselor Joe Kenny
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's perfect and he made this
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
during the initial funding debate uh
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
debate and vote and he said New
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is small enough and Nimble
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
enough to take a kind of Quasi pilot
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
pilot program to see where a program
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
like this could go we'll see how it goes
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
we hang on to good things and we let the
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
bad things go this is a bad thing it's
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
time to let it go it's time to squash
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
the program let's get New Hampshire's P
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have already paid $8
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
million at a minimum so far into this
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
program for a failed idea let's get them
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
off the hook and with that I'd be happy
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative Sullivan thanks
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I'm just um
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
not super familiar with this
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
you said that there are approximately
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
1100 private sector employees that are
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
covered under the plan is that correct
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide I think you should 1100 a
 
01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:07.070 align:start position:0%
Statewide I think you should 1100 a
little

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
over private individuals
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
1152 and uh private individuals under an
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
employer plan it's all this will all be
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
in here so you can look at it of 5800 so
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
you've got a total of 6,000 in the
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
entire state after three years of the
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
program another question
 
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
further question me inquire so okay I'm
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
just um is this because I'm I'm confused
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
you said that this would not work if
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
everybody if it was opt in is is the
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
reason it's not working is because it is
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
currently opt in with the exception of
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
the the the state which is G giving it
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
to everybody that's correct if you
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
didn't have the
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
10,500 uh state employees being uh using
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
that as their base pool for the entire
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
program again being paid for the state
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers without that the the amount of
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
money that each of these individuals
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
pays or the employer pays on their
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
behalf would not sustain the program
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to do one one more
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
question for question inquire um okay
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
so if we're looking at the private
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
sector what you're saying is is the vast
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
majority have chosen not to
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
participate that would be the case okay
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I I will I will also say one
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
one of the fiscal notes in there is
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting we would actually
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
increase the state's Revenue because
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
under this current program a portion of
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax that a
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
business plays they pays they get a
 
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
credit if they um sign up for the
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
program and there are 276 employers for
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
those 5,800 employees uh so we would
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
Gibbs um thank you um I have another why
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
question um and that is why you would
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
you want to make it difficult to
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
impossible for
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
workers to care for family members who
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
are ill I'm thinking of elderly parents
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of young children um and
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of PE workers who live
 
01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
paycheck to paycheck and therefore could
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
not possibly
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
self-insure and of course disability
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
insurance covers your own disability it
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover uh when your elderly
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
parents or your young children are sick
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
so why would you want to make it
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to impossible for people to
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
care for their families thank that's not
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legis of my my bill my
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill is to repal the bill the fmli
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
program so taxpayers aren't on the hook
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
for for for 10,500 state employees at a
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
cost of over $2 million a year that's
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
do representa Ammon thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turot for your
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um if if we hypothetically if
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
we did repeal the program are there
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
private options that the state could use
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
to have the same coverage for their
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
employees actually there are um I think
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in the testimony and
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
actually jog my memory on something um
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh private insurers actually offer
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
short-term disability insurance you know
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
the the level of what they do is
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
proportional or what they cover is
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
proportional to what your rate would be
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know in those back during the feltus
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
attempt uh we had a member on our
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee at the time who was actually
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
had his own uh insurance and I think at
 
01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
the time he was paying like $60 every
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
two weeks weeks for the program or $120
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
a month now that gives you an idea
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
somebody asked about um you know the the
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
the individual employers and without the
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
us paying for the tax uh with taxpayers
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
for the state employees why the program
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
would fail and that's because the
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
private some of these private
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
individuals are only paying
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
$5 every every week for a program that's
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
$240 a year you take $240 a year that's
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
20 uh somebody gets into a program they
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
can pull out I forget the number we've
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
looked at it at one time it was like
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
five grand or something you know put in
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
very little money so without the the
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
pool um that happens also in the packet
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
that I gave you is a letter from
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
somebody in the insurance department at
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
the time when this uh fmli was being
 
01:19:50.629 --> 01:19:50.639 align:start position:0%
discussed and it talks
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
about um she was saying she didn't say
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
we don't need need the fmli program but
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
what she was saying was we already have
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh Insurance um agent uh insurance
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
carriers looking to provide short-term
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
disability so yes that that does exist
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a great letter in there for
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
you representative meler uh thank you Mr
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
question sure um I think the way you are
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
presenting the taxpayers paying for this
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's somewhat misleading if my
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is the taxpayers are not
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
paying the premiums the benefit we're
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
probably paying for the administration
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the plan so could you make that clear
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers are not paying uh Joe
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
Smith's premium for his family leave
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what the New Hampshire
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are doing we're paying for
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
their premiums for the program
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's exactly what we're
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
doing just a little bit for the question
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
he he is
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
correct so if you're going to follow up
 
01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
on this question yes that that it is uh
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
in this case their
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
employer is the state of New Hampshire
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay and just like it's an opt-in plan
 
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.270 align:start position:0%
okay and just like it's an opt-in plan
for

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
employers yes we opted in for our state
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
employees in Senate bill to okay
 
01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.750 align:start position:0%
employees in Senate bill to okay
representative

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
sharesa thank you for taking a question
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
so is my assumption correct that uh is
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
my assumption correct that uh
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
most of the employers who participate
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
they're only state employer and not
 
01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.590 align:start position:0%
they're only state employer and not
private

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
employers

01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
275 employers have signed up I heard an
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
ad on NPR coming in this morning
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
private yeah that's correct 200 uh
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Hunt is correct 276 employers
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
have signed up over three years of
 
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.149 align:start position:0%
have signed up over three years of
advertising

01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
for a total of 5,800 employees which
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
represent less
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
than 1% of the total employees in our
 
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:05.719 align:start position:0%
entire State followup question okay for
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
the question so one of the reasons why
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
you want to repeal is as you mentioned
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
that you this will remove the business
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax credit for the plan so if
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax credit is
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
that the question then only a fraction
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the employers are enrolling in this
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
how much the state will gain
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
by not having that this is very the tax
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
revenue question that that I don't know
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know the actual dollar figure
 
01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.510 align:start position:0%
I don't know the actual dollar figure
thank

01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
you okay so just to answer that the idea
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
is that an employer can deduct as an
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
expense the payroll expenses which is
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
could be health insurance so you're
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
treating this as an health insurance so
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
that too is allowable to be
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
deducted representative Gibbs thank you
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh those short-term disabil
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
those private short-term disability
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
policies that you mentioned do they
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
cover short-term disability of family
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
members I I think it would depend on the
 
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
actual plan I I'm not an
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
insurance expert so I'm not sure I'm not
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to say yes or
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
no so with that we thank you very much
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um I have only opposition
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%

of my department am officially opposed
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
to this legislation I've tried to
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
intersperse throughout my testimony
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
a number of clarifying points to the
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
testimony that you just heard and
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
Corrections so hopefully by the time I'm
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
done we'll have addressed the questions
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
and concerns that you may have so as I
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
said Mr chairman I come today in strong
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
support of the Paid Family and Medical
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
Leave program and in opposition to any
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
effort to oppose it I would say at the
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
outset Mr chairman that the sponsor
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that all of us are enjoying
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
this benefit I would highlight Mr
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
chairman that I'm an unclassified
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
employee I have as much time off as I
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
need I don't need this benefit thank you
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
very much I still do my job so I want to
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that at the outset and look you
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
know I have great respect for
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative turot we've worked
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
together on a number of different issues
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
he and I simply have a fundamental
 
01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:15.639 align:start position:0%
different definition of success and
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
failure you know I approached this issue
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
through the lens of individual liberty
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility and the
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
fundamental tenets of economic Freedom
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
those are principles that as you know I
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
have long championed as you also may
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
recall given the history of this issue
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know this issue for two decades
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
finding a viable Paid Family Medical
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Leave program for New Hampshire was an
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
unresolved puzzle there were a lot of
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
proposals there was a lot of controversy
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
over that period of time and the state
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the N the past several years took a
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
trailblazing approach which really
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
followed the New Hampshire tradition of
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
tackling policy issues in innovative
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
ways while also avoiding the missteps or
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
problematic practices of what other
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
states have done in this area and again
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
I think that this program
 
01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
exemplifies that commitment so I want to
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
just briefly and as I said I'm going to
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
hit these points as I go through here in
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the quote unquote cost to the
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
state so it is true that we are
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
providing the benefit to State Employees
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
the state employees form the basis the
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
foundation of the risk pool the reason
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
that you did not have prior to this
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
program a private sector if you will uh
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
range of options for this coverage is
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
because insurance carriers could not
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
adequately determine what the takeup
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
rate of a voluntary Paid Family Medical
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
Leave product would be and so because
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
they did not have a basis of what that
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
Foundation risk pool would look like
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
they could not derive actuarially
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate actuarially sustainable
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
rates given that uncertainty and so by
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
having the state employees approximately
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
10,000 in number serve as the foundation
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
of that risk pool the carrier was then
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
able to go through that Actuarial
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
analysis to derive that rate and then to
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
make that benefit available to all who
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
want it and not fo it upon anybody who
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
does not want
 
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
it so first and foremost let's recognize
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
the essential purpose of this program
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
Paid Family Medical Leave is designed to
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
provide critical support during some of
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
life's most significant moments events
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
that in many cases are unforeseen and in
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
many cases are incredibly difficult for
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to go through
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
as insurance professionals we understand
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
that personal and economic risks are an
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
inherent part of our society and that
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate coverage is necessary to
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
address them this program is founded and
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
grounded in solid risk management
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
principles it pulls resources delivering
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
voluntary support to those in need while
 
01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
protecting individual insurers and
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
businesses from overwhelming
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
costs this is fundamentally a free
 
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
market approach that Fosters stability
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
allow allowing our partner in this case
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
metti who the state contracted with a
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
large well-experienced insurance company
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
that is partnered with the state to
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
administer the program to create
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
competitive pricing models based on real
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
data and let me say too the benefit of
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
having MetLife administer this program
 
01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
and Contracting and partnering with
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
MetLife is that MetLife retains all of
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
the risk of the
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
program so again I disagree with
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
representative turkot that this program
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
has been a failure but let's assume that
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
the experience which by the way has not
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
in any way borne out to this point let's
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
say that the experience begins to go
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
sideways that the premiums become
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
inadequate to cover the claims that's
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
not a risk that the state of New
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is bearing that is a risk that
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
metti is bearing we are not on the hook
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
should for any reason and again it's not
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
happening but for any reason if the
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
program begins to wobble financially
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
MetLife owns that problem not the
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
state so again this is a structured
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
program that promotes healthy
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
competition which we have seen we have
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
seen it through other carriers offering
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
supplemental products offering certain
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of this program while not doing
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
the whole package and meti just two
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
weeks ago offered an additional benefit
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
for mental health within this program so
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
they're innovating even within the
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
confines of this
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
program the result of all of that has
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
been to keep the premiums low and
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
affordable for both employers employees
 
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
and individuals you know it's
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
interesting when we began this program
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
one of the big concerns we heard was
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
that for individuals the premiums were
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to be poten po too expensive for
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
them to afford those who are on the
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
lower socioeconomic end of uh the scale
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
in our state and so we capped the
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
premiums for the individual pool at no
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
more than $5 per pay
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
week and I thought to myself at the time
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
well I know exactly what metti is going
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
to do they're going to go right to the
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
cap they're not going to do the
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
underwriting practices that would
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
traditionally go into setting a premium
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
for these people but okay we created a
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism to make sure that that $5 per
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
pay week was going to be sustainable
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
well I was wrong MetLife has gone
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
through the appropriate underwriting
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
process and the average premium in the
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
individual pool is actually below the $5
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
per paye cap so again I think it's
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
speaks to the financial viability and
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
experience of the program thus
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
far Mr chairman repealing this program
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
would inject uncertainty into the
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
marketplace now that consumers and
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
businesses have come to rely on this
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
coverage and I think the sponsor did
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
speak to that that there are people who
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
are relying on this coverage it could
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to increases in claims
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
on short-term disability I'm going to
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
talk about short-term disability in a
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
moment because that was brought up quite
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
a bit and potentially Workers
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
Compensation Insurance causing premiums
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh to incre increase for those two
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
products and I do not think that we can
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
afford to be increasing that burden on
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
our businesses or our families let's
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
talk for a moment about short-term
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
disability so I think as a number of you
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
previously short-term disability is a
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
different benefit than what this program
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
offers short-term disability is for you
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
you as an individual get sick again not
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
hurt on the job that's workers comp
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's a separate matter you get a bad
 
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis you get hurt in a non-work
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
related incident the short-term
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
disability covers you it does not cover
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
your ability to take leave to take care
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
of a family member who is ill or the
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
result of having a child or adjusting to
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
a military deployment that is not
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
covered under short-term disability
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
there was some concern at the time that
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
this program was was created that it
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
would eviscerate short-term
 
01:32:59.550 --> 01:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
disability and instead what would happen
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
is everybody would gravitate toward this
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
program didn't happen short-term
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
disability coverage in the state remains
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
very very competitive and in fact the
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
program is flexible enough that
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
employers can keep their current
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
short-term disability coverage and work
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
with MetLife to get a skinny down
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
version of this program
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
that will cover just the coverage for if
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
you need to take care of a family member
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
and we have a prominent business in the
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
state who has done exactly that and the
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
cost for him to add this coverage on top
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
of his short-term disability benefit is
 
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
unbelievably affordable very very
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
affordable working very very well for
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
that that business I also want to be
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
clear that New Hampshire's approach here
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
is being mimicked but at the time it was
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
UN paralleled in the nation while other
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
states were imposing mandatory programs
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
that needed to be subsidized with
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
punitive taxes we carved out an
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
Innovative approach in a market oriented
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
path that supports our Workforce without
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
strangling those employers with new
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
costs it's no accident that my phone
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
frequently rings from the offices in in
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
Governor's offices and legislatures in
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
places like Florida Governor desantis's
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
office was calling me every other week
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
for a good period of time wanting to
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
know how we designed the program how the
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
experience was going thus far uh before
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
she became a cabinet secretary Governor
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
gnome in South Dakota was calling us
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
quite frequently we'd also heard from
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's offices in Iowa Kansas
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
and Louisiana all wanting to understand
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
how we had approached this how it was
 
01:34:50.669 --> 01:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
going high degree of interest on their
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
part to potentially bring this model to
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
their state
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
I would also mention that the program
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
serves as a strategic tool for
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
attracting top talent in retaining top
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
talent and as you know in today's
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
competitive job market companies that
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
offer these types of benefits stand out
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
I will tell you from personal experience
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
I live in Salem to borrow a phrase I can
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
see Massachusetts from my
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
house and our Employers in
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
Salem in all of the communities along
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire border have a really
 
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
tough road to hoe because they've got to
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
compete with Massachusetts they've got
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
to compete with the Boston
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
Market now there are obvious and smart
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
benefits to working in New Hampshire
 
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.310 align:start position:0%
benefits to working in New Hampshire
versus

01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but this current
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
generation of Workforce has different
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
expectations and values different things
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
than the generations of the past you
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
know my parents and my parents
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
generation they stayed with one employer
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
their entire career they collected a
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
pension they retired this current
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
generation values work life balance they
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
want a wide diversity of benefits to
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
take advantage of they're a little bit
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
more Mobile in their careers and I think
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
that this program has served as a
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
valuable tool to the business Community
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
to be competitive for Workforce to again
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
retain and attract uh this critical new
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
generation of Workforce that they're
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to need in order for not only them
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
as a business to be successful but
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
economically for the state to continue
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
successful there's been a lot of talk
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
about the tax credit component of this I
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
want to bring Clarity to that issue the
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
business is entitled to a business tax
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
credit for 50% of the premium that they
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
pay for their
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
employees for this benefit so I just
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about that
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
so the the cost we have not seen hit the
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
general fund in any significant way thus
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
far I think if it had you'd probably see
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
Dr here in the room and they're not
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
here so again Mr chairman repealing this
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
program would jeopardize in my opinion
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
our state's economic Edge as businesses
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate where to invest and grow and
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
why are they looking at this benefit
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
well again it's about retain retaining
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
and attracting Workforce but as the
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned uh a number of
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are self we
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
self-insuring this particular benefit
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
and so this program has allowed them to
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
get a financial benefit as a result of
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
that which I think is a good thing for
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
our business Community allowing them to
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
enjoy some of the benefit of offering a
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
coverage that their employees want and
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
need so in summary members of the
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee the pat Family Leave program
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
strengthens our economic
 
01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
situation here in New Hampshire and
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
supports individuals and families it
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
embodies our commitment to community
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
resilience while driving a competitive
 
01:38:02.159 --> 01:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
resilience while driving a competitive
Insurance

01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
Market um interestingly I heard that
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
there was a concern that other public
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
employers were suddenly motivated to
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
offer this benefit because the state was
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
doing it I assume the term public
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
employers means
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh to which I would say I
 
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
a a strong adherent to the de Hampshire
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
tradition of local
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
control and so if communities want to
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
make decisions as to what benefit
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
offerings they're going to extend to
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
their employees that's going to be up to
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
them and I'm not sure why the state
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be trying to dictate what they can
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
or can't offer in terms of benefits to
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
their employees so the local control
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
piece for me Still Remains quite
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
prevalent as it pertains to that
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
particular point
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
the last point that I'll make and I'll
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
turn it over to my colleagues is the
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
idea of enrollment so let's remember at
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that this is a
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
commercial product this is not a
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory program we have not had to
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
employ an army of state employees to run
 
01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.669 align:start position:0%
employ an army of state employees to run
this

01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
program it is available to all who want
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
it it is not forced upon any who do not
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
so therefore it is fundamentally a
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
commercial product and so I've asked a
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
number of insurance carriers to look at
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
the enrollment numbers for this program
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
and I have asked them if you were
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
rolling out a product for the first time
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
and you had this type of
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment how would you feel about that
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
and their response was for a firsttime
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
program and by the way the numbers for
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
the employer side of things yes the
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
program has been in existence for three
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
years very important to note that the
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
first of the program it came online I
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
believe in December or January and for
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
those of you who have owned or operated
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
a business you know that you've made
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
your decisions in terms of what benefits
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to offer to your employees
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
well in advance of December and January
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
you've probably made those decisions in
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
September or October so I think in terms
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
of the employee the business enrollment
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
you've got to Discount I think that
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
first year of the program so what you've
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
left with in terms of again the employee
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
the employer side of that is really a
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
two-year experience but again back to my
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
point I've said to those insurance
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
carriers if you had this enrollment
 
01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
within a two to threee time period how
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
would you feel about that and they have
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
said that enrollment is
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
phenomenal it's phenomenal for a
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
commercial product being rolled out for
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
the first time in that period of time
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
that enrollment is incredibly strong so
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
at at least from an insurance
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
perspective here again representative
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
turkot and I and I say this respectfully
 
01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
have very very different definitions of
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
success and failure so with that Mr
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
Kean good morning my name is Cassie
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
Keane I'm the um Deputy Commissioner of
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
services and uh commissioner beton court
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
is in charge of the insurance department
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
and they implemented rules to establish
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
the commercial product that he's been
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
talking about but it was the department
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
of administrative services and the New
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Employment Security Department
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
that were charged with implementing the
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
benefit Statewide and I'm going to talk
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
to you a little bit about how that
 
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
benefit works and rich is going to talk
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
more about enrollment numbers that the
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee has been interested in um so
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'll start by saying in New Hampshire
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
there were four state employees who
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
worked on implementing this benefit it
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
was rich it was me and it was two other
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
um individuals at the department of
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
administrative Services um we did have
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
consultant support we do have a
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
marketing vendor because the law
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
authorized us to uh enlist that support
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
and required us to promote Outreach and
 
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
education about paid family medical
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
leave as um commissioner beton Court
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
said this is a unique model for a paid
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
family medical leave in in our country
 
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
this issue is being debated from state
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
to state and our model is different from
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
most other models it's voluntary the way
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
the program works is it requires the law
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
requires that the state provide coverage
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
to all state employees to create a
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
market so that an insurance carrier will
 
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
come in and provide this product in our
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
state thereafter participation in Paid
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
Family Medical Leave is completely
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary an employer can choose to
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
participate or not to participate an
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
individual whose employer does not
 
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
provide the coverage can choose to
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
purchase their Pro the coverage on their
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
own through what we call an individual
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
pool so that anyone who is a New
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire worker has access one way or
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
another to Paid Family Medical Leave
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
coverage it may interest you to know
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
that there is a federal bipartisan
 
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
working group working on paid family
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
medical leave and one of the models that
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
they have adopted for presentation and
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
debate is the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
model that's what they call it and quite
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
frankly we're quite proud of that um so
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
we um the law passed it was House Bill
 
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
two right so it passed in June of 21 we
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
opened enrollment to employers beginning
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
in December of 22 for coverage and and
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
employers can enroll at any time and we
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
did our first open enrollment and
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's an annual open enrollment for
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to participate
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
under the law it's a 60-day period in in
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we we did um open enrollment
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
from January 1st till 60 days later
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
sorry can't remember the date now
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
um we um let's see under the law we were
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
required to um
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
cover state employees there are just shy
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
of 9,000 state employees who are today
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
receiving that coverage by the way for
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
state employees in the law it was
 
01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
actually um designed I think quite
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to take into account that
 
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
state employees already have that
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
first-person coverage that the
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner was talking about we
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
already provide a form of short-term
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
disability income protection for state
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
employees so state employees only have
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave okay that
 
01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
means that they can um submit a claim if
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
they have a family member who has a
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
serious medical condition and they need
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
to be absent from work or if there is a
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
deployment in their family either to
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
help someone prepare for that deployment
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
or in the event of illness or injury it
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
their their um absence from work and
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
their wage replacement benefits go into
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
effect so they can help take care of
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
that family
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
member um we as I mentioned charged with
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
promoting this um this product
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and um we worked
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
very hard we have a very wonderful
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
website if you go on nh.gov on the top
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%

promote the plan through um uh we have a
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
television commercial maybe some of you

have seen it on Channel 9 um I tend to
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
see it on Saturday Sunday mornings
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
before a closeup and um we've also
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
promoted it through radio spots radio
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
interviews we've spoken with the
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
business business and industry
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
Association we've gone to many chambers
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
of Commerce uh we're on social media
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%

01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
sponsored fishercat games uh thrown out
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
first pitches um and um we have also
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
been at the Glendy and um I'm even one
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
out one major thing we did
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh um job fairs job fairs and we we
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
recently went to the municipal
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
association annual meeting and had a
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
breakout session on paid family medical
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
leave so we've worked very hard very
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
diligently to meet our responsibility
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
under the law to get the work out and um
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
we are proud of the enrollment in this
 
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
plan and what it reflects is that it's a
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary plan and that's what we chose
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
for our state and we believe it's been
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
quite successful so I'm going to turn it
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
over to Rich for him to cover the
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
to dance here um Mr chairman I had a
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
handout I'll hand over here and we can
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner um so I I'll quickly and
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
again Richard L's Deputy Commissioner uh
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
Employment Security tasked along with
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
admin services and operationalizing the
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
program so I'll talk to enrollment on
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
what we've seen um and um can obviously
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about that I know
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
that some of the numbers that
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative turkot have has provided
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh will be different um but I think uh
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
they're obviously point in time numbers
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um but also some of his numbers might um
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
uhu not represent exactly what he was
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
describing them to represent so um any
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between those two would be
 
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:15.639 align:start position:0%
more than happy to address
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
that um one other state um uh that is
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
also um uh borrowed in and stealing what
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has done is our neighbor
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the west uh Vermont um is now doing
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
um exactly what New Hampshire has done
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
um including creating an individual
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
option so um uh that's uh the the best
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
form of flattery um when someone steals
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
your good ideas so um as those handouts
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
make it around um I'll just again just a
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
few slides here with numbers the first
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
one uh just a chart showing our current
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment the number of workers with uh
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Paid Family Medical Leave
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
available to them you'll see that we
 
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
have just over
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
23,600 New Hampshire workers who have
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
this coverage available to them this
 
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
includes the 88 um 100 State of New
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employees that have it as an
 
01:49:20.109 --> 01:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
employer provided benefit um as the
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor had uh described um but but we
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
also have just over
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
13,300 um workers with both public and
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
private New Hampshire employers that
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
have chosen to voluntarily sponsor
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
coverage and make this benefit available
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
to their workers um lastly in this chart
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
you can see just over
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
1,400 individuals so uh in New Hampshire
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
we have the individual plan where you
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
can purch purch your own coverage we'll
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
get into that a little bit more um but
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
we have 1,400 individual workers who did
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
not have this coverage available to them
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
through their employer so they chose to
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
purchase it on their own at that maximum
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
weekly amount that commissioner beton
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
Court had described of $5 per week so th
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
those are the current um numbers for New
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers that have this
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
available to them when we flip the page
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more detail on the
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
employers that have chosen to sponsor
 
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
coverage um we have um 308 New Hampshire
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
employers uh that have sponsored
 
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
coverage U
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
85% of those uh employers that have
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
sought this out are smaller employers
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
meaning they have fewer than 50
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
workers the uh information on the bottom
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
of that uh page you'll see in the bar
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
chart um you see some detail on the
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
individual benefit um one of the I think
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
the real uh wins for the New Hampshire
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
program is what New Hampshire has been
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
able to provide to those workers who
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
have no other option in accessing this
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
type of coverage and so you can see here
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about those
 
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that have chosen to purchase
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
coverage and what we have um experienced
 
01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
thus far with those 1,400 individuals
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
that have that have chosen to purchase
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
they are largely women uh they are
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
largely young women and it should come
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
as no surprise that these young women
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
who have no other option for paid leave
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
from their employer who chose to
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
purchase this they are by and large
 
01:51:47.709 --> 01:51:47.719 align:start position:0%
taking this in order to spend time with
 
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
a newborn child so 75% of those
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
individuals are women uh 67% under the
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
age of 45 and nearly 80% of them are
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
utilizing this leave which they have
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
decided is important to them they are
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
using this to bond with a newborn or
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
newly adopted
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
child when we flip the page for the last
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
um um two charts you can see some
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
detailed on utilization across all three
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
coverage types so both the state of New
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers um and how they are
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
currently using it very low utilization
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire workers
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
um you'll see how the individuals who
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
have purchased this how they're
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
utilizing the benefit again 80% of the
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
leave is for bonding with a newborn
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
child um and then in the employer
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
sponsored coverage at the bottom of that
 
01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
chart you see a little bit more of a
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
balanced picture for what individuals
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
who have the coverage through their
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
employer and how they're utilizing the
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
benefit so there you've got 46% of those
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
workers are utilizing it or 46% that
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
file a claim again utilization very low
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
in the employer sponsored um uh Market
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
um but 46% of those claims are for
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
bonding with a newborn child and
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
23% of those are for caring for a family
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
member so commissioner beton Court had
 
01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
described that another type of coverage
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is not available to a worker who
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
might have short-term disability
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
coverage available through their
 
01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
employer again that's only first person
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
coverage you don't have the ability to
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
take that leave with some um um wage
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
replacement um in order to care for your
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
spouse for your child for your parent um
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
all of those are options that are
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
available through um if you have an New
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Paid Family Medical Leave
 
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
coverage and you can see how that breaks
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
down yeah I S interrupt you but I'm
 
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble because it looks
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
like two colors is the same I know I
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
apologize that Mr chairman sometimes
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes Adobe and PowerPoint don't
 
01:54:03.149 --> 01:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
behave so I'm going to just take it as
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
the lower one so like for instance the
 
01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire coverage the 66
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
is actually child bonding correct yeah
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and then in I should have mentioned
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
in that in state of New Hampshire you
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
only see two types of leave being taken
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
because it's the individual as Deputy
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Keane had mentioned that's
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
all that New Hampshire provides to its
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
employers because we an existing
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
short-term disability um program thank
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
you sorry um and then and lastly and
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
again sorry about uh that blending of
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
the colors um and then lastly you see in
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
that bottom slide um just some
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
information on the individual open
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment that we just completed so
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
every uh Year from uh the beginning of
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
December through the end of January we
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
do as the law requires we do a 60-day
 
01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
open enrollment for individuals again
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
these are individual individuals who
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire they do not have
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
comparable coverage available to them
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
through their employer and they are then
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
eligible to purchase that coverage on
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
their own so that 60-day open enrollment
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
that we just completed we had nearly a
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
thousand applications come in and we now
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
have an enrollment picture in that
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
individual program that is going to
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
likely be north of 1,800 individuals so
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
some some of those are still being
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed by MetLife they need to confirm
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
what types of coverage the employers
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
have to confirm that they are in fact
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
eligible um but again nearly so you got
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
a thousand individuals who came in
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
during a relatively short window and we
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
have an enrollment in that individual
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
benefit of over 1,800 individuals um
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
that are now able to have this coverage
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
so um we thought that you know seeing
 
01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
some of those numbers and what that take
 
01:55:55.709 --> 01:55:55.719 align:start position:0%
up has been in a purely voluntary model
 
01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
um would be helpful as you uh evaluate
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you have before you
 
01:56:00.119 --> 01:56:01.830 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you have before you
thank

01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.950 align:start position:0%
thank
[Laughter]

01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Sullivan start
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
with you thank you Mr chair uh thanks
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I think I
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
think what I'm I I understand the
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this of this legislation I I
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
think his issue with it is that the
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
people people the approximately 8800
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
people from New Hampshire are getting it
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
for free and that seems to be what is
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
upsetting him
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm curious one of the things
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
he said is without them this program
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
would not be viable so is this the Crux
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
of the issue that we're dealing with or
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
is this something that could be rather
 
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
than throwing out the whole bill maybe
 
01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
it could be tweaked to make them have to
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
pay some share or something like I'm
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
curious what the options are here and
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
and and maybe you could answer if if
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
there weren't 8800 people let's stick to
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
the that that fundamental question let's
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
we have everybody else wants to ask
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions already noon let's try to be
 
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
short and sweet I guess to really narrow
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
the question down for someone who was
 
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
around when this legislation history of
 
01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
around when this legislation history of
this

01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
legislation how many of do you know how
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
many of the employers are actually
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
paying it directly or actually deducting
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
it from the employees
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
paycheck so rich probably has those
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
numbers just very briefly Mr chairman to
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's Point yes it
 
01:57:38.069 --> 01:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
is in fact the case as I described in my
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
testimony the approximately 9 10,000
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
state employees are necessary for the
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
program to then be offered to the rest
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
of thetical mass yes you needed that
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
foundational risk pool for what
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
eventually became metti to be able to
 
01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.709 align:start position:0%
eventually became metti to be able to
then

01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
derive an appropriate actuarially
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
sound basis to to set premiums at so you
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
need those individuals again to make the
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
rest of the program work I appreciate
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that he objects to the to to
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
this being paid for for those
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
employees I would mention that I once
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
did the numbers and Cassie can probably
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh correct me if I'm wrong I once did
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
the math and it represents somewhere in
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
the range of 0.3 to 0 6% of the total
 
01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
cost of the benefits that the state of
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire offers to State
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
Employees I understand that the state is
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
working through a difficult economic
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
time I don't know that you're going to
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
solve a ton of problems with that 03 to
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
0 6% savings at the expense of the
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
benefit that this program offers to the
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
state but that's my opinion thanks for
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
the uh answer um and Mr chairman to
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
answer your question the employers that
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
are sponsoring coverage 70% of them are
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
paying for the full premium so that's 24
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
of those sponsoring employers uh 20% are
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
are having their workers pay for it um
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
in any situ in any time the employer
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors but has the worker contribute
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
any portion to the premium the workers
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
have a choice whether they want to do
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
that or not oh really cuz that wasn't
 
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
part of the original plan no so they
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a they they choose to opt in or opt
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
out yeah so that's another layer of this
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
how this is voluntary okay great um and
 
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
then the other 10% are split that's a a
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
shared model shared model where the
 
01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
employer and the worker are each picking
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
up a part but again those workers would
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
have the choice great and then the a
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
number of employers that offered um a
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
short-term disability plan um that are
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
now offering this um or rather the
 
01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
employers that did not offer short-term
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
disability coverage is about 66% so
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the sponsoring employers
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
had no short-term disability prior to um
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
deciding to offer this and I can almost
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that if you're an employer
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
and not offering short-term disability
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
then you probably do not offer a family
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
caregiving benefit either so new
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
coverage for all those workers great
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
represent walls did you have your hand
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
up seemed like everybody over there had
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
their hand up thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan covered some of
 
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
it but as a follow on to solve this or I
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
I'll reword it how what is the taxpayer
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that is being paid for for
 
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
this the
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
8,826 uh state employees that receive
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
this benefit for free do you have that
 
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
number I I do um in I have the fiscal
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
year 24 total expenditure was 1. 1452
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
million to cover all state employees all
 
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
government okay representative
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
Speer okay representative
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
buroughs okay representative M I'm just
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
GNA go around uh yes just to I think
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
what I asked my question earlier of
 
02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
Representative turot turo I didn't quite
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
get it through so it's true that
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay 100% of this benefit but
 
02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
they also pay 100% of their salary and
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
everything else so this is not that much
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
different would you believe would you
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
believe thank
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:32.679 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today uh just
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
focusing in on the advertising budget I
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
think I heard the number 1.9 million is
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
that did I hear
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
right and and so just question about
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
that is there are you tracking Roi on
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
your advertising uptake versus spending
 
02:01:50.350 --> 02:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
and is there you know trends that you're
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're tracking can we see that data
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
so so um I I'm looking at my budget
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
numbers from fiscal year 22 and 23 which
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
are our implementation years um we had
 
02:02:06.189 --> 02:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
an appropriation of of 700,000 in22 and
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
1.7 million
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
in23 um we we actually only spent 1.3
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
million in in 23 that's what I would
 
02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
call Administration um representative
 
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
mcclear was was referring to as I
 
02:02:21.149 --> 02:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned we worked with a consultant
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
during imp
 
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
mation um and we do have a marketing
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
vendor that's helped us place the media
 
02:02:30.669 --> 02:02:30.679 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned just quick follow
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
question uh and so you're tracking uh
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
the uptake for dollar spent and it's the
 
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
state spending the money not the carrier
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
the car so you're advertising a product
 
02:02:43.149 --> 02:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
for a a private company it is correct
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
that the state is responsible and paying
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
for the marketing and Outreach yes we
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
are TR we are tracking how many
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
individuals we reach with different
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of um initiatives the TV
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
commercial social media that kind of
 
02:02:59.709 --> 02:02:59.719 align:start position:0%
thing and then ultimately we have our
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
enrollment data that rich referred
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
to yes it' be great to have that
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
great representative yeah thank you for
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
um taking my question so I was wondering
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
now that the program is up and running
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
is there any um interest desire or um
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
next steps to have employ employees the
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
state employees contribute to this
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
program so I want to make sure I
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
understand they're not contributing
 
02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:30.679 align:start position:0%
they're contributing zero for the
 
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
benefit now in the future is it possible
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
to ask them to start to contribute to
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
this benefit is my question is it
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
possible sure that would have to be
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
hashed out in a collective bargaining
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation which again speaking to
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's point the
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
reason we simply offered the benefit to
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
State Employees was because we wanted to
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
get the program up and running and and
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to potentially get bogged
 
02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
down in that collective bargaining
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
process so if you have a desire to see
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
the state employees begin to contribute
 
02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
identify the members of the negotiating
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
team on behalf of the state and you can
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
put a bug in their ear on that my memory
 
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
was that when we did it the the state
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
employees hadn't had a raise in like
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
four or five years but prior to this was
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually sort
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
of of a raise it had been quite some
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
time time to my recollection and
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
obviously in the last
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
race and didn't calculate this I guess
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative Gibs did you have a
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
question um just um to uh clarify um at
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
the time when this was when this came
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
into effect um the state employees had
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
not had a raise so this was in in effect
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
in L of a
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
raise no I don't think that's exactly
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is true it is not it was not in L
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
of a raise it was just happened happen
 
02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
stance but and it was just the beginning
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
of Co
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
too okay representative sharesa so uh
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you foring a question uh my qu
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
this seems like a excellent program my
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
question is that as the representative
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
who sponsor the bill he was mentioning
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
that only 5% of the private employers is
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
participating currently so can you throw
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
some light why the enrollment is so low
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
from private employers and what can be
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
done to make it more appealing to the
 
02:05:29.159 --> 02:05:31.750 align:start position:0%
done to make it more appealing to the
private

02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
employers um yeah thank you for that
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
question you know the the downside of
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
having a voluntary program is not
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
everyone makes the choice that you want
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
them to make right um and what you want
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
them to make not what I wanted to make
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
when we had this bill um so we we've
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
done as the law has required and we've
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
toured the state talking with as many
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
chambers and um employer associations
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
and small groups and large groups as we
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
as we can um to talk about this program
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
that's available to them so um employers
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
make their own choices um they decide
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
what's important for them for
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention and um those
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
employers that um have uh U decided that
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
this would be um a good tool for them to
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
help attract and retain workers have
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
purchased the coverage others are
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
looking into it they might offer a
 
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
short-term disability um and you know
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
they will uh continue to be education
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
and Outreach that is done um and that
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
number will continue to grow um what it
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
will grow too I don't know um but that
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
again that's the uh the um the the part
 
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
of it being voluntary um we'll be
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
continue to provide that education
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
employers will continue to make their
 
02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
own decisions on what they want to do
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you represent okay we're all set
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative said uh thank you
 
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question are you
 
02:07:05.229 --> 02:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
adding the cost of the the person is on
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
long-term leave okay during this benefit
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
so somebody else is doing that work are
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
we adding that cost also into the
 
02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
calculation because somebody else is
 
02:07:18.549 --> 02:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
doing the work that person will not do
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
work yeah I I think think I think
 
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
employers when they when they look at
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this type of coverage and and
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
providing paid benefits in general they
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
weigh that right um so here we're
 
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
talking about six weeks of coverage uh
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
for most plans employers that do sponsor
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
they can increase that to um mirror the
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
FMLA protection of 12 weeks um but I
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
think most employers look at this um and
 
02:07:45.069 --> 02:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
they balance the cost of the employee
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
not being there uh to the cost of losing
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
that employee when they go out to have a
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
baby to bond with with a new child to
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
care for a family member I think one of
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
the Lessons Learned in Co was not
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
wanting to to lose that connection to
 
02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
your employees and this helps them
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
maintain that
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
connection yeah I would say that when we
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
took up this legislation that issue did
 
02:08:10.830 --> 02:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
come up um in terms of you know that you
 
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
know the the employer you know and that
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
was one of the reasons why this
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee insisted this be a volunteer
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
plan rather than a mandatory plan but I
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
would say do have in a statute that um
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
you can't fire an employee who is taking
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
leave because of having a
 
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
baby right and now the job protection is
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
only that which is already in place for
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
the federal family medical leave this
 
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't expand that or change it any
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
exactly didn't but that was already on
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
the books so be clear okay thank you
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:08:51.229 --> 02:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay um needs to say uh we're we're past
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
the the lunch hour um I've have the last
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
bill you know he's going to come back
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
later um so uh every one of you here uh
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this bill and we certainly
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
understand that um this committee did
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know to take the position uh that
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
that it wanted it was supported the bill
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
on the circumstance that it was
 
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary um so uh having said that I
 
02:09:19.470 --> 02:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
guess is please you know when you come
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
up and testify because we always want to
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
let everybody have an opportunity to
 
02:09:22.199 --> 02:09:23.430 align:start position:0%
let everybody have an opportunity to
speak

02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
but if you can find something new
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise you can get up here and say
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know please do not do this you know
 
02:09:31.629 --> 02:09:31.639 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill that would be good
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
too but that um I mostly your two to
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
three minutes and if we do that we're
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
going to be here another half hour so so
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%

02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions and have written testimony
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%

you have to push the button there you
 
02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman hunt and honorable
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
Laura milikin I'm the executive director
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire hunger
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions uh we are a small
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um we are one of the private
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
employers who uh gladly pay the premiums
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
um for the New Hampshire the uh New
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plan we um
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
are able
 
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
to hire and retain employees because we
 
02:10:30.669 --> 02:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
can offer a competitive benefits package
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
we could not have been we would not have
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
been able to afford it uh without this
 
02:10:38.589 --> 02:10:38.599 align:start position:0%
plan being in place um we have eight
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
employees uh we offer them 12 weeks of
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
leave through the plan we pay all of the
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
premiums um and we think it's a good
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
deal um because it allows us to attract
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
excellent employees um and uh to date
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
three employees have used the benefit
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
two of them were uh young women who um
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
took the leave to care for their
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
children um both of them had
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
complications during their pregnancies
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
and also needed to be able to heal
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
during that time it was absolutely
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
critical um and then my one other
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
employee um had to take leave to take
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
care of her mother who got cancer um and
 
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
they were able to get through those
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
those Hard Times without worrying about
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh being able to make ends meet um and
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
that was uh absolutely critical for them
 
02:11:39.149 --> 02:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh and they came back and that was what
 
02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
was absolutely critical to us um so uh I
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
will just say that the plan is um very
 
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
important to nonprofits like mine um and
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
to the health both of our employees
 
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so I urge you to
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
vote uh in expedient to legislate on uh
 
02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.189 align:start position:0%
vote uh in expedient to legislate on uh
HB

02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%

Nancy

02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
Glenn thank you shair and members of the
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Nancy Glenn I'm
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
from Sutton New Hampshire I am also a
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
select board member for my town this
 
02:12:23.950 --> 02:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
kind of feels like a Deja Vu moment for
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
me because the first time I ever
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
testified on a bill was for Paid Family
 
02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Leave thus I would like to think
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
that I would not be considered ignorant
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes down to what this bill
 
02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
looks like um I shared my story publicly
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
including with Governor sununu um about
 
02:12:43.549 --> 02:12:43.559 align:start position:0%
my son who is going to be 13 in April
 
02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
god um who was born premature and he
 
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
experiences chronic health conditions
 
02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
and a disability I also shared a story
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
about my second son who unfortunately
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
passed away shortly after he was born he
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
was also premature and I had some
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
complications during birth um this is
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
affected me in my family drastically um
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
both physically and mentally but
 
02:13:06.189 --> 02:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of people right now in New
 
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently stand to lose this
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
program um many local municipalities
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
like mine um we offer um we were able to
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
offer this to our employees to help keep
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
our local property taxes down it's an
 
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly affordable program we have 26
 
02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
employees in Sutton thus we do not
 
02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
qualify for the federal FMLA job
 
02:13:32.109 --> 02:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
protection coverage um we spend about
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
$6,6 per year to be able to cover all of
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
our folks we did the buy up plan to 12
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
weeks and we cover again the entire cost
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
and this equates to just cents on the
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
dollar for our local taxpayers a couple
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
months ago we had an employee out
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
because of side effects from a brain
 
02:13:54.589 --> 02:13:54.599 align:start position:0%
injury that they received from a car
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
accident and they were able to utilize
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
this program right now we have a
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
transfer station employee who is on
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
leave because he had to get surgery on
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
his eyes and he also has access to this
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
program and in a few months Our Town
 
02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
Administrator will be taking it to be
 
02:14:14.549 --> 02:14:14.559 align:start position:0%
able to care for their wife in
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
newborn all have the option to utilize
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
this program um I just wanted to amplify
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%
that small business in small towns we
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford this on our own and our
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
wages really aren't that great because
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
of how high taxes are and having
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
affordable benefits like this helps us
 
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
to attract Workforce which is Again
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
difficult for small towns and um a
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
younger Workforce for that matter um
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
that are more likely to accept a lower
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
salary for more
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
benefits my personal story clearly
 
02:14:50.669 --> 02:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
motivated me to want to make sure that
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
my town employees had access to paid
 
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
filing medical leave and I'm incredibly
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
grateful that the state has created a
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
program that people like me could have
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
accessed this back in the day when I was
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
when I had my
 
02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
kiddos but I just wanted to sit up here
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
and just say like let's not remove
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
something that does good for Granite
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
State Staters and something that helps
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
local municipalities like mine be able
 
02:15:17.069 --> 02:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
to offer a benefit to their employees so
 
02:15:19.629 --> 02:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
I am here to ask you to also vote in
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%

um 517 thank
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%

Medical Leave program as a benefit for

our eligible employees Forest Society
 
02:16:37.309 --> 02:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
pays the premiums for this program so
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
there's no cost for employees um and the
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
way they've sent it up is that this pres
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
prevents an employee from depleting
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
their health leave or PTO balances for
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
these qualifying life events the annual
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
premium we pay is $16,000
 
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
in 2024 two of our employees utilized
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
the benefit which amounted to $118,000
 
02:16:56.719 --> 02:16:57.950 align:start position:0%
the benefit which amounted to $118,000
in

02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
wages excuse me both the benefit to our
 
02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
employees and the security of stable
 
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums has worked well for
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
our organization and employees the
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
forest Society has 40 employees enrolled
 
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
in the program our employees report that
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is a huge financial relief to some
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
who have who would have been made to go
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
without pay our employees have a level
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
of comfort knowing they have this option
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
and as an employer we use this program
 
02:17:22.509 --> 02:17:22.519 align:start position:0%
as a recruitment and retention tool we
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
feel this program is not only beneficial
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the individuals who use it but the
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
organization uh by promoting staff
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
longevity and loyalty this program is an
 
02:17:31.549 --> 02:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
important motivator of younger family

want to live and work in New Hampshire
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
rather than seeking employment out of
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
state as a nonprofit We PRI pride
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
ourselves on making efficient use of our

revenues which include promoting High
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
staff retention rates the loss of this
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
program would set us and the state back
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
in attracting the best and brightest to

benefits program last year to align our
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
disability insurances with the Paid
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
Family Medical Leave program we
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
terminated our short-term disability
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
program and changed our long-term
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
disability program to align with the
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
paid failing medical leave program so
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
that no one will have any lapses in
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
their coverage between the two
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
plans from when we started the program
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
in September 2023 to today 17 team
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
members have already utilized or are
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
currently utilizing the program we also
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate two more team members taking
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
time away in the next few months for
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
medical leave if paid failing medical
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
leave were repealed and the program
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
ceased to exist as early as this year as
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
hb7 517 prescribes we do not know how we
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
would accommodate the sudden loss of
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
benefits it would leave gpon scrambling
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
to find a new benefits plan and there
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be significant financial
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
repercussions for our company since we
 
02:19:28.429 --> 02:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
would honor what we've promised our team
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
members including those who have already
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
made plans to take leave uh later this
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
year our team members are very grateful
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
that we participate in the program and
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would negatively impact our
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
company and our Workforce it would be a
 
02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
financial burden to our company and it
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
would be a huge loss for our team if New
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's paid forly medical program
 
02:19:47.309 --> 02:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
ended we ask that you vote in opposition

02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
and committee um I've lived in New
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 2017 my name is Adriana
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
espia I work here I got married here I a
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner in nsha and in 2024 I gave
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
birth to my son here while my employer
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
does offer some paid parental leave it
 
02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
does not cover the full 12 weeks of FMLA
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
um I was exploring options on Google to
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
cover that unpaid time and discovered
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
this program I asked my employer to
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
participate and they did they have less
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
than 50 employees so I pay MetLife
 
02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
directly um two of my co-workers have
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
used it it was extremely helpful to them
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
I couldn't use it for my first child
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
since I found out about it too late in
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
my pregnancy but I've been paying for
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
over a year since January 2024 in the
 
02:20:58.990 --> 02:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
hopes that I could use it for future
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
children I love New Hampshire and my job
 
02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
but if Paid Family Leave goes away um I
 
02:21:06.910 --> 02:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
may have to look for a transfer to
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
either our Boston office or even leave
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
the state allog together our family
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
could not afford for me to take unpaid
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
leave especially with the cost of child
 
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
care for my son and our mortgage uh Paid
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
Family Leave is part of the package of
 
02:21:21.870 --> 02:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
reason that I enjoy living here in New
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and working in at a New
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business um I've been paying
 
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
my premiums dutifully I have a reminder
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
on my phone to do it um just like I pay
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
my health insurance my car insurance um
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
and my life insurance uh if this is
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
repealed then I don't get the benefit or
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
the product of what I've been paying
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
into and that is quite frankly not fair
 
02:21:44.830 --> 02:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
um all those premium payments would be
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
for nothing and if I had known that this
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
program was going to go away I would not
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
have started to pay into it um early
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
this month my son turned a year old we
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
celebrated at the common man I consider
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
him a true Granite stator um so I'm
 
02:22:02.429 --> 02:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to vote itl to give
 
02:22:03.870 --> 02:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
me a chance to continue to grow my
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
family here thank you thank you very
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
Sears good afternoon chairman hun
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:22:24.429 --> 02:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
Amanda Sears and I'm the director the
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state director for the
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
campaign for familyfriendly economy um I
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
just will be very brief to say that we
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
um would ask you to make an itl motion
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill um as you've heard there
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
are you know thousands of granite
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
Staters who are benefiting from this
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
program um we in fact believe that what
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
you should be doing is considering the
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
opposite um of this bill and expanding
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
this program so that it covers more
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
folks um in this and better meets the
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
needs of New Hampshire families um in
 
02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
particular I want to point out that this
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill would of course um get rid of this
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
benefit for New Hampshire state
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
employees which would be um a you know
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
again the wrong direction to go to get
 
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
rid of this benefit for people who are
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
relying on it to meet the needs of their
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
family um as they meet the needs of our
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
state through their employment so thank
 
02:23:18.269 --> 02:23:18.279 align:start position:0%

02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory and uh when you said expanding
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:05.560 align:start position:0%

bman I represent Hillsboro 3 NASA Ward 4

I'm also a registered nurse working in
 
02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
the women's Maternal Child Health space
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
for the last 15 years I am also
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
certified as a perinatal mental health
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
specialist by the only certifying board
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the country I'm also a mom of three
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
I oh sorry um I will say that I my
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
position is that we also need to be
 
02:27:39.389 --> 02:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
working towards more comprehensive FMLA
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you're not aware and I'm going to
 
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
take the position of the moms because we
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
know there's a large large majority
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
using them there's a maternal Health
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
crisis right now this is the most
 
02:27:50.429 --> 02:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous country to have a baby we have
 
02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
the highest uh morbidity and mortality
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
rates in the country the number one
 
02:27:58.670 --> 02:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
cause of pregnancy related deaths is
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
maternal mental health and most of the
 
02:28:03.870 --> 02:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
deaths happen not in the birth which a
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
lot of people think but within that
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
first year postpartum as far as 6 to8
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
months out now uh New Hampshire has some
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
of the highest rates of maternal mental
 
02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
health as well conditions now the risk
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
factors for that um are are are going
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
back to work too early Financial
 
02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
stressors are a huge component that will
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
increase our risk of maternal mental
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
health um in addition it uh decreases
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
other things that we need so uh breast
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
freeding rates which The Academy of
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
Pediatricians recommends exclusively for
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
six months we know when people don't
 
02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
have enough uh leave those rates
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
decrease which increases um health
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
conditions in the baby that leads to
 
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
more visits to the pediatrician more
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
times that parents have to take off of
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
work uh keeping FMLA will decrease the
 
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
rates of perinatal mental health
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
conditions it's going to increase the
 
02:29:05.309 --> 02:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
rates of breastfeeding and therefore
 
02:29:07.269 --> 02:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
actually save money in the long run by
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
helping us uh with some of the in some
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
of those other avenues I would like to
 
02:29:15.550 --> 02:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
also speak to the economic piece I
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
recently worked at an organization in
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
Boston uh providing uh resources for
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
women during pregnancy and postpartum
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
our product is so much in need that
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
companies would come to us and buy this
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
product to improve the pregnancy Journey
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
for people and I bring that up to show
 
02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
that this is so important that Women's
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
Health FMLA these kinds of things are so
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
important that we're absolutely seeing a
 
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
standardization of that um and so people
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
who are young are looking for this I
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
gave the example of Boston because as
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
someone said said people can just go
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
over the line and we're going to lose
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
people in the workforce another economic
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh risk here is that we know that when
 
02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
people don't have enough FMLA they're
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
actually um less likely to come back to
 
02:30:05.469 --> 02:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
the workforce so what we're looking at
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
here is businesses having to take on
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm sure you're aware of extra
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
costs of training new employees so this
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
not only attracts our ability to attract
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
but also to retain many many employees
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
I will summarize here and just say that
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the program may not be
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
perfect but we need to be moving towards
 
02:30:32.349 --> 02:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
FMLA we need to make the program better
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
and not get rid of it completely uh you
 
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
know we need to not throw the baby out
 
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
with the bath water pun intended thank
 
02:30:42.670 --> 02:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank you my
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
position is obviously to itl yes thank
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
Benfield I think I'm the last one too uh
 
02:31:00.910 --> 02:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
another one appeared out of nowhere I
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
thought I was going to be the Clos
 
02:31:04.429 --> 02:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
hiding back there all right um well good
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody for the record I'm
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
Karen Benfield from um State workor play
 
02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are Statewide nonprofit
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
born out of the former born out of
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
former Governor uh John Lynch's task
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
force on young worker retention as you
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
can imagine I um uh uh reiterate and
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
line with everything that my colleagues
 
02:31:24.670 --> 02:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
and um other experts uh at the table
 
02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
have said in regards to um uh the
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
workforce risks that this that um uh
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
repealing the fmli um present um to our
 
02:31:37.389 --> 02:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Marketplace so I will not
 
02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
repeat all of that um appreciate it
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
however um however I also was not going
 
02:31:45.309 --> 02:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
to speak I was just going to drop off my
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
letter and um be a great audience member
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
but um I was called to speak to you all
 
02:31:54.510 --> 02:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
um um because the prime sponsor on this
 
02:31:58.110 --> 02:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
bill shared an alternate to this program
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
um as a private insurance um a alternate
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
program um being uh private insurance
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
and reference that individuals may just
 
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
need to be more fiscally disciplined um
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no amount of discipline
 
02:32:13.269 --> 02:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
can eliminate the growing cost burden of
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
living in this state especially um if
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
you are considering starting a family um
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of bravery and Capital um
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
to start a family in New Hampshire um uh
 
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is not very conducive to our
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
efforts as an organization that's
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
looking to attract and retain young
 
02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
young people here in New Hampshire um
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
nor does this comment really feel rooted
 
02:32:35.269 --> 02:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
in a reality um that is true for the
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
majority of young people here in New
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um just again reiterating
 
02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
um commissioner beton Court's uh
 
02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
definition of success as well um Brands
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
take a long a long time to um build so
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh I would just uh counter that the
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
state the state might consider um
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
partnering with more organizations to
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
spread the word on this program um State
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
workor play would be happy to partner on
 
02:33:00.910 --> 02:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
that as well um and we also would um are
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this um and um would
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
move to itl as well so that's all thanks
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
great thank you so the last but not
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
least Leon Perez lean
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
Perez okay
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh I apologize it's my first time um so
 
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this quick um I'm here
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
in a strong opposition to House Bill 515
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
um eliminating this vital program will
 
02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
have detrimental effects on the working
 
02:33:37.269 --> 02:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
class and consequenc the economy of New
 
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my wife and I are expecting
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
our first child next month and the
 
02:33:43.469 --> 02:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
existence of this program has been a
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous relief to our family it
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
provides us with the opportunity to bond
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
with our child without the crucial uh
 
02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
during this crucial time without the
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
added stress of lost income the support
 
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
is essential for families across the
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
state that are navigating the
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
significant financial demands that come
 
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
with Parenthood I'm sure you all know
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
kids are
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
expensive um short-term cost cutting
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
will not bring long-term economic
 
02:34:08.950 --> 02:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
success for New Hampshire this is not a
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
handout this is a hand up from a
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
personal standpoint we're fortunate to

Peter yes thank you for that welcome for
 
03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Lucius parshall of
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for allowing me to
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
introduce uh House Bill
 
03:39:15.550 --> 03:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
556 I'd like to think of it as a true in
 
03:39:18.349 --> 03:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
labeling protection for products labeled
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
as biodegradable or
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
disposable in general terms this
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is a truth and
 
03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
advertising measure to ensure the
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our Solid Waste Management
 
03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
it does not require policing and
 
03:39:35.309 --> 03:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
generates no expense within our state
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
budget neither does it ban such items as
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
foam cups or plastic bags but it does
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that such products are label that
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
are labeled compos that they meet
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
certifiable benchmarks before being
 
03:39:51.870 --> 03:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
deposited within our waste
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
flow Governor aots proposed moratorium
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
on new landfills emphasizes our need to
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
better manage our current landfills the
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services estimates that
 
03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
Granite saders disposed of approximately
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
165,000 tons of food waste in 2020
 
03:40:10.229 --> 03:40:10.239 align:start position:0%

03:40:11.229 --> 03:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
waste
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
flow and as of February 1st of this year
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 300
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
0223 requires producers that generate
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
one ton or greater food waste per week
 
03:40:24.030 --> 03:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
to divert such waste from landfills to
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
authorize food waste facilities provided
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
that said facilities within 20 miles and
 
03:40:32.429 --> 03:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
the alternative faculty has capacity to
 
03:40:32.439 --> 03:40:35.150 align:start position:0%

03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
bucks uh we know that nearly half our
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
landfill waste originates out of our
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
state but this is one area but this
 
03:40:49.229 --> 03:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
particular area is one area we actually
 
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
export more waste than import when it
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
comes to compost we have seen small
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
compost collection business spring up
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
and flourish in many of our
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities but we have only one
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
instate composting facility located in
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
summersworth two other facilities one in
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and one on Star Island are
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
unavailable to the general public Star
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
Island that's because it's on an
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
island um so as a result much of our
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
compostable waste is taken across the
 
03:41:18.469 --> 03:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
border to Vermont and Maine I had
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
visited the dummerston Vermont uh
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
compost collection this past summer was
 
03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
part of my cheap date with my wife and
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh and um I've been told there they're
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
nearing capacity and only be a matter of
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
time before they can no longer accept
 
03:41:33.760 --> 03:41:35.030 align:start position:0%
time before they can no longer accept
outstate

03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
outstate
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
waste so we need to Hampshire Solutions
 
03:41:39.309 --> 03:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
in order to man manage our own waste
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
flow and address our organic waste
 
03:41:44.189 --> 03:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
stream and this has to be one of the
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
first steps I feel
 
03:41:48.590 --> 03:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
when we have generally greenwash we we
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
have generally greenwash and um sorting
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
our Plastics in various categories but
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
this also caus us to lose sight of the
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
larger components of proper landfill
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
management much of our household trash
 
03:42:00.990 --> 03:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
is known to be contaminated with forever
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
chemical such as past among hundreds of
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
other potentially toxic
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
compounds when the waste is combined
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
with our organic waste our landfills
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
produce a toxic and complex biological
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
and and physiochemical soup called leee
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
these elich hates invariably find their
 
03:42:19.110 --> 03:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
way into our beautiful streams and
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
rivers and comp and comp and compromises
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
not only their health but the health of
 
03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
every Cien every citizen in our
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
state so there's a clear cry for
 
03:42:31.950 --> 03:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
emphasis on diverting our organic waste
 
03:42:34.830 --> 03:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
into compost and I have full faith that
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
given time our state will embrace the
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
proper treatment of our food waste at
 
03:42:41.149 --> 03:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
least as effectively as we manage our
 
03:42:41.159 --> 03:42:42.429 align:start position:0%
least as effectively as we manage our
plastic

03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
Stream So it leads to the question of uh
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
what solid food waste is actually
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
compostable obvious banana peel easily
 
03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
breaks down my backyard uh composting
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
but me scraps and the other and other um
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
like they require higher temperatures
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
that are typically found in our
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
commercial facilities there's also an
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
emerging market for products that break
 
03:43:06.910 --> 03:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
down within the guidelines for of these
 
03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh commercial
 
03:43:10.269 --> 03:43:10.279 align:start position:0%
faculties the products are fairly
 
03:43:12.670 --> 03:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
identified to the serviceware that is
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
commonly found in our takeway Packaging
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're able to be fully composted
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
without even microplastic
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
residue there are Laboratories such as
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
biodegradable products Institute or BPI
 
03:43:26.550 --> 03:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
for short you might have seen picked up
 
03:43:30.030 --> 03:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
a coffee cup and seen that on their um
 
03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
label um it certifies that the products
 
03:43:35.149 --> 03:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
been independently tested and has been
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
verified to break down completely in a
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
commercial Compost Facility after use
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
the third party certification follows
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
ASM standards 64 00
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
d6868 orm d841 standards set forth by
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
the American Society for testing the
 
03:43:57.070 --> 03:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
materials again I stress this is a
 
03:43:59.070 --> 03:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
language Bill and does not require any
 
03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions in purchasing habits of our
 
03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
retailers or consumers neither does it
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
have any Financial impact I have
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
circulated an amendment which I would
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
highly recommend uh it uh contains
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
suggested language from BMI cleaning up
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
some of the language that was in the
 
03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh Bill and also uh moves the placement
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill under RSA 339 as advised by
 
03:44:27.389 --> 03:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:44:29.910 --> 03:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
um so in conclusion as a common sense
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
provision I would hope PVE the way to
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
better management of our waste system
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
and I urge its pass passage thank you
 
03:44:37.710 --> 03:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
available for
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
spear not in any way questioning whether
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
or not this is a good
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
idea have you talked to Dees or how
 
03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
would we even know that somebody was
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
doing this I mean how would we enforce
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
it I have spoken with the
 
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
dees um right now there is no
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement because you can put whatever
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
you want on a package including it's uh
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
biodegradable compostable or even uh or
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
whatever but this language specifically
 
03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
reserves the word
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
compostable to a process that we can
 
03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
scientifically test to and say it breaks
 
03:45:20.349 --> 03:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
down now you're asking about the teeth
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
in such a bill I gather I'm sorry to say
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
that again you're asking about what
 
03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:32.149 --> 03:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I I guess that's what it is
 
03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
because some of these uh some of this
 
03:45:36.910 --> 03:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
stuff is coming in from uh companies
 
03:45:39.870 --> 03:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
that are outside the state or wherever
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not clear on how he would
 
03:45:43.269 --> 03:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
control any of
 
03:45:47.710 --> 03:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
it what comes in from the out state is a
 
03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
little bit beyond our control right now
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
this bill does not address what people
 
03:45:54.189 --> 03:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
do in other states this bill addresses
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
what happens in New Hampshire and it
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
does not ban anybody from selling a foam
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
cup it merely states that if you're
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
going to put compostable on the label
 
03:46:05.389 --> 03:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
then it has to adhere to a certain
 
03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
amount of testing or mislabeling and if
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
you are mislabeling in your product you
 
03:46:12.910 --> 03:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
are subject to the same fines and uh
 
03:46:14.910 --> 03:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions as for any type of Miss
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:23.469 --> 03:46:23.479 align:start position:0%
339 does that
 
03:46:25.469 --> 03:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
help I'm going to have to do some
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
research because I can't see how we're
 
03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
going to enforce it I have I can't see
 
03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
how that can happen yet be would you
 
03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
believe what would you believe would you
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
believe represent gibes thank you Mr
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
chair um the original Bill refers to
 
03:46:46.110 --> 03:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
product labeled as biod degradable or
 
03:46:50.070 --> 03:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
compostable and the um Amendment removes
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
the word biodegradable and refers only
 
03:46:55.830 --> 03:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
to items labeled as compostable can you
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
tell us why you made that change I made
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
this change um on Consulting with uh the
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh BPI Labs the biodegradable products
 
03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
Institute labs they said that keeps us
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
in line with what occurs in most other
 
03:47:12.910 --> 03:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um yeah we're we're now was
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
saying your Amendment had some number
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
number problems on it um and I I so I'm
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
going to ignore the 399 in the amendment
 
03:47:34.429 --> 03:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
and look at the 3
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
339 and uh I have to admit for myself it
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
was like uh a path down memory lane
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
because some of those over there's you
 
03:47:47.229 --> 03:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
this is number 80 so I've been around
 
03:47:50.349 --> 03:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
for a couple of those and how they are
 
03:47:51.870 --> 03:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
in the statute and the nature of the
 
03:47:54.670 --> 03:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
statute I don't I don't I have to look
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
follow up with whether it's an unfair
 
03:47:58.510 --> 03:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
trade practice on the consumer
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
protection act which is 398 so I'm not
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
not sure I think that's where the 399
 
03:48:06.429 --> 03:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be but it's it's a
 
03:48:09.309 --> 03:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
Wonderland so no matter what um every
 
03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
bill in this committee does go to a
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we'll figure a way out
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
on this one well that's good that's good
 
03:48:20.030 --> 03:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing I I guess I want to is
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
when it says labeling is compostable are
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
we talking about the packaging or are we
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
talking about what's inside the
 
03:48:32.790 --> 03:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
package I would say well we're talking
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
about both um when I pick up my
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
um paper cup from my local co-op or from
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
my coffee shop I can see right on The
 
03:48:45.790 --> 03:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
Coffee Cup itself that it says it's been
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh tested and certified by BPI to break
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
down in a commercial facility It also
 
03:48:53.229 --> 03:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
says it's not don't put in your backyard
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
but that's another story but it says
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
that right on that that's in terms of
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
what I mean now we have to get into the
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
definition of what's a compostable right
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I think this circumvent the idea of
 
03:49:06.670 --> 03:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
what is compostable because we're R
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
relying on the standards uh set by for
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
the American Society for testing and
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
materials we're using their standards so
 
03:49:15.149 --> 03:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have to worry about defining
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
the word compostable they've already
 
03:49:19.710 --> 03:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
done it for us got it
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
much I now have another
 
03:49:29.229 --> 03:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
card from Mike noric from the Department
 
03:49:29.239 --> 03:49:30.349 align:start position:0%
card from Mike noric from the Department
of

03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:49:33.550 --> 03:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
Dees who was reluctant to testify but
 
03:49:36.510 --> 03:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm dragging him up
 
03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:38.870 align:start position:0%
I'm dragging him up
here

03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:49:41.309 --> 03:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
um uh good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
Michael norc I'm here representing new
 
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees uh I'm in the solid waste
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
management Bureau and uh happy to we're
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on HB 556 but uh I
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
am happy to uh provide any information
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
or answer any questions that the
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee might have relative to this
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill would you be the enforcement agency
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
for this
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
legislation so as introduced the bill
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
was placed into RSA 149 M which Dees is
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcement
 
03:50:17.910 --> 03:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay um we had communicated with the
 
03:50:20.189 --> 03:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor about placement in that statute
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
because the particular location in that
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
statute was that that was chosen was
 
03:50:28.990 --> 03:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
around disposal prohibiting disposal of
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
certain items and this seemed to be a a
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
bill related
 
03:50:35.550 --> 03:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
to distribution of products it's not a
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
disposal ban per se um so that's why I
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
think representative parall had uh
 
03:50:42.149 --> 03:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
introduced this amendment to place it in
 
03:50:44.950 --> 03:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 339 to move it out of which is trade
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
and commerce right tra right move it out
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
so in terms of enforcement as amended I
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on who enforces RSA 339 it
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
might be Department of Justice uh well
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
attorney it's consumer protection it's
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
consumer thank you so that's why it was
 
03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
memory lane for got
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
you okay um so in terms of I guess I
 
03:51:10.269 --> 03:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
Before I Let You Go um this I've never
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
heard of ASM before um do they just
 
03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:15.830 align:start position:0%
heard of ASM before um do they just
distinguish

03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
distinguish
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
between the packaging what biodegradable
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
is the packaging biodegradable or is it
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
what's insided by agreable how how do
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
they distinguish when someone puts it on
 
03:51:29.070 --> 03:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
the package that's a great question so
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
this is the those ASM standards are
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
American Society for testing um
 
03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
materials method and materials thank
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
you that's a it's a it's a national
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
standard uh organization that sets up a
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
lot of different procedures and and
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
testing protocols for various
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
engineering purposes and and other
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
scientific purposes um this these
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
particular standards as I understand it
 
03:51:55.600 --> 03:51:56.790 align:start position:0%
particular standards as I understand it
are

03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:51:59.229 --> 03:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
targeting what you might call cons
 
03:52:01.710 --> 03:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
compostable products or service wear
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
things like spoons cups right that's
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
what I thought when I read so the actual
 
03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
not not necessarily the packaging but
 
03:52:10.469 --> 03:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
the product itself is is intended for
 
03:52:14.349 --> 03:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
like food service that is uh something
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
that would break down in a composting
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
process because I've seen now I had
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
these plates and actually civilware that
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's looks like wood but they're
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
supposed that's the idea so these
 
03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
standards are governing those the
 
03:52:26.830 --> 03:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown of those types of materials
 
03:52:28.990 --> 03:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
and those products
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right anybody else have any
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:52:40.590 --> 03:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
um having no more cards on 556 we will
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
close the public
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
hearing and moved on to to the one looks
 
03:52:49.950 --> 03:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.960 --> 03:52:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll open up the public hearing
 
03:52:56.760 --> 03:52:57.950 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll open up the public hearing
on

03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
delay good afternoon
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Jessica L Montaine
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
from straford uh District 17 which is
 
03:53:20.319 --> 03:53:22.670 align:start position:0%
from straford uh District 17 which is
doward

03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
doward
 
03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
five and here to talk about this bill
 
03:53:29.309 --> 03:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
three bill this bill does three uh
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
important things it removes the
 
03:53:35.149 --> 03:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
exemption of Medicare supplement plans
 
03:53:37.149 --> 03:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
from the now wellestablished law that
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies cannot
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
descript exclude people from their plans
 
03:53:45.189 --> 03:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
based on having a pre-existing condition
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
it requires that any insurer of a
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplement plans offer these
 
03:53:53.429 --> 03:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
plans based on community rating for the
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
age of the participant that means they
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
cannot charge over-the-top premiums to
 
03:54:01.469 --> 03:54:01.479 align:start position:0%
individuals with pre-existing
 
03:54:04.229 --> 03:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
conditions it also requires that every
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
insurer in the state that offers
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans must also offer
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplement or Medigap plans
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is to prevent insurance companies
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
from reacting to number one and two by
 
03:54:22.990 --> 03:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
simply not offering Medigap policies in
 
03:54:24.189 --> 03:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
the State
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
anymore insurance companies make a lot
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
of money off of Medicare Advantage
 
03:54:34.349 --> 03:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
plans so protection for pre-existing
 
03:54:36.670 --> 03:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
conditions is really important and we
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
have laws that protect us from being
 
03:54:38.960 --> 03:54:40.030 align:start position:0%
have laws that protect us from being
denied

03:54:40.030 --> 03:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
denied
 
03:54:42.510 --> 03:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
coverage for having a pre-existing
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
condition and most Americans take this
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
first granted now when we buy health
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
insurance we understand that we don't
 
03:54:50.229 --> 03:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
have to pay extra for having a
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition that's what's
 
03:54:54.149 --> 03:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
called a community
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
rating the amount will go up as we get
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
older but it's also based on and it's
 
03:55:00.870 --> 03:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
also based on where we live but it's a
 
03:55:02.990 --> 03:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
shared risk
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
pool however Medicare supplement plans
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
do not have these protections which I
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
only learned recently and I find it
 
03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
really appalling
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
there is guaranteed issue when you first
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
sign up for Medicare at
 
03:55:24.269 --> 03:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
65 and with few exceptions it's only
 
03:55:28.590 --> 03:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that first year after that if
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
you develop a problem on a long list of
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
pro conditions that include Alzheimer's
 
03:55:38.910 --> 03:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
cancer congestive heart failure diabetes
 
03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
with complications or End St endstage
 
03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:42.950 align:start position:0%
with complications or End St endstage
renal

03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
renal
 
03:55:45.870 --> 03:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
disease there's no guarantee that you
 
03:55:48.510 --> 03:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
can get another plan if you want to sign
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
protections so that gets us into the
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
problem of Medicare
 
03:56:01.349 --> 03:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
Advantage Medicare Advantage plans are
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
are not traditional
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare that operate on a fee for
 
03:56:07.269 --> 03:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
service model with the Medicare
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
Advantage insurers are paid um an annual
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
fee by the government to cover that
 
03:56:13.800 --> 03:56:15.710 align:start position:0%
fee by the government to cover that
patient

03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:56:18.429 --> 03:56:18.439 align:start position:0%
and so they make money by spending uh a
 
03:56:20.510 --> 03:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot less on the individual's Medical
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
Care than they receive from the
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
government and I understand how that's
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
all Insurance works that way but the big
 
03:56:29.229 --> 03:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
difference is instead of the individuals
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
paying for that that premium the federal
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
government is paying that
 
03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
premium so Congress approved these plans
 
03:56:39.630 --> 03:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
because they were sold on the idea that
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage was going to save a
 
03:56:43.870 --> 03:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
lot of money to the taxpayer but the
 
03:56:45.790 --> 03:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
opposite it is
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
true um companies like United Healthcare
 
03:56:50.670 --> 03:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
are making huge profits with Medicare
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
Advantage and the cost of the government
 
03:56:55.990 --> 03:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
has only gone up and these plans are
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
really heavily
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
marketed you know especially when people
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
are first turning 65 and eligible for
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
Medicare or they become disabled and are
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
Medicare and we've all seen it the
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
endless ads during open enrollment to
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
buy these plans and they're a little
 
03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
misleading because you look like you're
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
given a number to call the government to
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
sign up for Medicare but you're actually
 
03:57:22.269 --> 03:57:22.279 align:start position:0%
being calling a private insurance
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
company that's selling you on this
 
03:57:28.950 --> 03:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
plan and you know my husband's
 
03:57:32.349 --> 03:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
75 um every open enrollment he probably
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
gets 20 calls a day for the months
 
03:57:38.349 --> 03:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
months on end trying to get him to
 
03:57:41.070 --> 03:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
switch over to Medicare
 
03:57:43.229 --> 03:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
Advantage now many people like their
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage
 
03:57:48.750 --> 03:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
plans they tend to be the younger set of
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
people eligible for Medicare 65 to
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
75 and this bill does not prohibit
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
anyone from buying Medicare Advantage
 
03:57:58.870 --> 03:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
plan if that's what they want or signing
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
up for it the government is the one
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's buying it um but the problem is
 
03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
is once you've passed the initial
 
03:58:10.030 --> 03:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment and trial period and then you
 
03:58:13.229 --> 03:58:13.239 align:start position:0%
develop a major medical condition you
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
can't get another plan that works better
 
03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:16.990 align:start position:0%
can't get another plan that works better
for

03:58:16.990 --> 03:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
you because of the exemption of laws
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
that protect the rest of us from being
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for having the
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition so people are
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
then trapped in insurance plans that are
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
not working for
 
03:58:35.229 --> 03:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
them because they often have highly
 
03:58:35.239 --> 03:58:36.590 align:start position:0%
them because they often have highly
restrictive

03:58:36.590 --> 03:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
networks tedious and lengthy prior
 
03:58:42.670 --> 03:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
authorizations and high claim
 
03:58:45.469 --> 03:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
denials all this keeps individuals from
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
getting the care they
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
need and when they need
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
it nine out of 10 Medicare enroles do
 
03:58:56.590 --> 03:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
not have guaranteed issue protections to
 
03:58:59.189 --> 03:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
purchase Medigap beyond the initial
 
03:59:02.149 --> 03:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage trial
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
period And if these enrollers develop a
 
03:59:07.630 --> 03:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
serious medical condition they will not
 
03:59:10.429 --> 03:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
have the coverage that they
 
03:59:14.830 --> 03:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
need so if we this bill were to pass
 
03:59:17.429 --> 03:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
will it cost us all a lot more in
 
03:59:22.030 --> 03:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
premiums probably yes but not by that
 
03:59:24.630 --> 03:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
much the Kaiser Family Foundation
 
03:59:26.110 --> 03:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
published research looking at the
 
03:59:28.110 --> 03:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
average Medicare supplement premium
 
03:59:32.030 --> 03:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
rates by state and by the type of
 
03:59:35.229 --> 03:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
rating the Nationwide average for
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
premiums for all plans is
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
$217 a month there are 10 states that
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
have Community rating that average of
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
all those States is
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
$223 a month so only $5 more and I
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
understand that that figure is not
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
really uh statistically confident
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
because you need to control for a lot of
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
other things like how big the state is
 
04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
and what kind of plan mix they has have
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
and other things but I don't have access
 
04:00:05.950 --> 04:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
data um but it does suggest that
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
Community rating for having a larger
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
pool doesn't
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
not um overwhelmingly increase the
 
04:00:17.319 --> 04:00:19.630 align:start position:0%
not um overwhelmingly increase the
premium

04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
premium
 
04:00:19.640 --> 04:00:21.670 align:start position:0%
premium
rates

04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
rates
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
um we did meet with the Department of
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance on several times to discuss
 
04:00:32.429 --> 04:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
this bill and just at our meeting last
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
Friday they gave us results where they
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
conducted a survey of of 23
 
04:00:41.469 --> 04:00:41.479 align:start position:0%
insurers um and we were informed that
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
the responses suggest an average 50
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
% increase in premiums and that's not
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
really consistent with the data from the
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
Independent Kaiser Family Foundation
 
04:00:55.550 --> 04:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
that shows that you know Community
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
rating is not 15%
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
higher of with states that have that
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
with States who
 
04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:04.590 align:start position:0%
with States who
don't

04:01:04.590 --> 04:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little skeptical about
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
that but moreover I disagree with some
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
premises uh stated on
 
04:01:17.149 --> 04:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
um a fact sheet that the insurance
 
04:01:20.429 --> 04:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
department um wrote up regarding this
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill I mean one statement is that
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplements are guaranteed
 
04:01:28.110 --> 04:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
renewable that's true but only if you
 
04:01:30.269 --> 04:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
choose the same
 
04:01:33.189 --> 04:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
plan another is that products are priced
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
assuming stable
 
04:01:40.469 --> 04:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
regulations um you know first we have a
 
04:01:42.790 --> 04:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
lot of time be before regulations could
 
04:01:46.149 --> 04:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
be adjusted if we were to pass this law
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
before the next open
 
04:01:50.830 --> 04:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment um but I believe it's more
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
important for the market for the
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
consumer to have freedom of choice and
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility that's really what we're
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
04:02:02.000 --> 04:02:03.550 align:start position:0%
looking for
here

04:02:03.550 --> 04:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
and another is idea that healthier
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
people tend to choose two cheaper plans
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
with more cost
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
sharing when they get sick people tend
 
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
to switch to the more benefit Rich plan
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
plan and this would increase cost ratios
 
04:02:21.790 --> 04:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
and drive up rates for all
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
customers but however that seems to me
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
that that's that's how we should behave
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
as consumers right we want to make the
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
most rational choice for us to make and
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
if that means getting an insurance plan
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
that meets your needs that should be a
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
choice that we're allowed to
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
make and the existing laws actually
 
04:02:47.550 --> 04:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
prevent people from being able to do
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
this and it is true that when people
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
disenroll from Medicare Advantage plans
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
and go back to traditional
 
04:02:59.309 --> 04:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare they do tend to cost more
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
studies show that Medicare spends an
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
average of 20% 27% more on such
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries but in the first year
 
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
after they make the
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
switch and likely cause for this is that
 
04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
switchers were unable to get the medical
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
switch and the fact is that Medicare
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans tend to cover the
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
younger healthier set of the people
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare and that's the main reason
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
medical insurers Medicare Advantage
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
insurers are making such huge
 
04:03:39.870 --> 04:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
profits but my biggest problem is the
 
04:03:43.389 --> 04:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
statement made that allowing consumers
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
to join a traditional Medicare plan with
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
supplements later when they're unhealthy
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
unfairly causes premiums to rise for all
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
enrollers that joined when they were
 
04:03:54.720 --> 04:03:56.070 align:start position:0%
enrollers that joined when they were
first

04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
eligible but what seems really unfair
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
situation is right now we expect people
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
when they first sign up for Medicare at
 
04:04:05.040 --> 04:04:05.950 align:start position:0%
when they first sign up for Medicare at
age

04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
age
 
04:04:10.149 --> 04:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
65 to choose the plan that's be for the
 
04:04:11.550 --> 04:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to be good for them for the
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives now who at 65 is
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
going to say well I know in eight years
 
04:04:19.070 --> 04:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to have cancer so I need a
 
04:04:22.269 --> 04:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
better plan then no one can make that
 
04:04:24.510 --> 04:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
decision though I think it's likely
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
after the conversation we had in our
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
committee this morning given how the
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
access to medical records electronic
 
04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
medical records the insurance companies
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
probably could predict pretty well what
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
you're based on your family history and
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
I I think that there's a lot of data out
 
04:04:43.439 --> 04:04:44.309 align:start position:0%
I I think that there's a lot of data out
there

04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:04:48.189 --> 04:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
that um people can predict how what risk
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
you have for developing certain
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
conditions better than we can ourselves
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
you look really skeptical about that but
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
well it sound like you just applied that
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
they have a hippo violation that they're
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
getting personal information about
 
04:05:04.510 --> 04:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
people's medical records I'm shocked to
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
hear that okay that maybe but I believe
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
that there is a lot of data out there
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
and that indiv idual
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
insurers they they can access a lot of
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
data about our health given the rec okay
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
but that is supposed to be able to but
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe if it's not working then I
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
agree but I think this legislation is
 
04:05:36.030 --> 04:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
really important because it without it
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
it leaves so many of our in seniors and
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities seriously
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
underinsured when they develop major
 
04:05:43.680 --> 04:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
underinsured when they develop major
medical

04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:05:48.550 --> 04:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
problems and this will ultimately cost
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
04:05:54.910 --> 04:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
more money in the long run because if
 
04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
people develop a s serious medical
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
condition they don't have adequate
 
04:06:00.990 --> 04:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
Financial protections with their
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
insurance they will go broke trying to
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
pay their medical
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
bills 65% of all bankruptcies in the
 
04:06:12.189 --> 04:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
country are due to medical debt and if
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
we leave
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
our seniors without these protections um
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
many of them will end up on
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so this bill will ensure that
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire seniors and peoples with
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities on Medicare have the
 
04:06:28.349 --> 04:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
ability to choose the health insurance
 
04:06:30.910 --> 04:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
plan that works best for them they're
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
not trapped in Medicare Advantage plans
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
that don't meet their needs and have the
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
same protections regarding pre-existing
 
04:06:40.830 --> 04:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
conditions that the rest of the
 
04:06:46.510 --> 04:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.590 --> 04:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
great um before we take questions um I I
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
do have a couple of questions Cu uh I
 
04:06:58.590 --> 04:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm now 68 yeah so at 65 I got the
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
letter saying that I had to buy Medicare
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I had to get it I had to get off of
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
my wonderful small employer plan and I
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
had to buy Medicare yeah and I was
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
informed there are two kinds of of plant
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
I can buy supplemental plan and an
 
04:07:17.399 --> 04:07:18.510 align:start position:0%
I can buy supplemental plan and an
advantage

04:07:18.510 --> 04:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
plan and I said and then it was made
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
clear that the advantage plan the
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
supplement fee was nothing yeah and so I
 
04:07:32.910 --> 04:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
said what's the
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
catch well the catch is that if you
 
04:07:35.560 --> 04:07:37.189 align:start position:0%
catch well the catch is that if you
choose

04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
choose
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
Advantage you can't go back to the
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
supplemental at all now you're telling
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
me when I'm about to learned here
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
tonight and you learn something new
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
every day is that if I really did want
 
04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
to go back to a
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
supplemental that then I have to go back
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
to pre jeen 7 sville you know 7-Eleven
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
that I have to fill out a medical report
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
and they can decide how much they want
 
04:08:06.030 --> 04:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
to charge me for my premium because I'm
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
making this decision to choose to go
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
back to a supplemental what is a
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
supplemental supplemental is well I used
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
to call it the Gap so if you if you're
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
within your Medicare you um you get you
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
know it's it's 80 80 20 whatever 85
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
whatever and that that remaining amount
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
you're getting a third insurance company
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's that Gap policy so you can do
 
04:08:33.149 --> 04:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
away with that if you choose the
 
04:08:35.830 --> 04:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
advantage plan which doesn't have you
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
you yes I I'm the only reason I'm in
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
United Healthcare now is because Harvard
 
04:08:44.429 --> 04:08:44.439 align:start position:0%
pulled out on me
 
04:08:47.550 --> 04:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
and uh but I would say is to answer your
 
04:08:47.560 --> 04:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
and uh but I would say is to answer your
question

04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:08:49.199 --> 04:08:50.710 align:start position:0%
question
about

04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
cancer I made sure before I choose that
 
04:08:54.640 --> 04:08:55.710 align:start position:0%
cancer I made sure before I choose that
Advantage

04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
plan for Harvard and for my United
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
Healthcare I said the only thing I'm
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
worried about is
 
04:09:05.309 --> 04:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
cancer and I just wanted to make sure
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
that both Le clinic and Dana Farber were
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
in the network and they
 
04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
were so that's why I chose those prod so
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to understand here is is
 
04:09:19.389 --> 04:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
that the open enrollment
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
period in what it in November December
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
that period I thought you can change
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
your advantage plan with no
 
04:09:31.950 --> 04:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
consequence and I believe that's what
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
the department is saying you can change
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
your plan but if you want to go
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
back to the supplemental plan yeah the
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
one that you waved off on yeah when you
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
choose Advantage out of the get-go you
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
run the risk of having them
 
04:09:49.760 --> 04:09:51.790 align:start position:0%
run the risk of having them
do

04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
underwriting well you may be more
 
04:09:56.830 --> 04:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
informed than the average consumer of
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
insurance products well I hope I'm
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
probably the most informed yet and you
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
know a a lot of people aren't
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be able to judge
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
their own risks that way and also that
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
the plans are so heavily marketed and
 
04:10:12.670 --> 04:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
they'll promise oh we're going to pay
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
for your gym membership or this or that
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
and um most people aren't going to be
 
04:10:23.550 --> 04:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
aware of the issues that they will have
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
until they develop a serious problem and
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
they may think oh be I'll be you know
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
you don't know what the network you'll
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
be in the network network that you
 
04:10:36.269 --> 04:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
thought you would be covered by your
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
plan that might be completely different
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
10 years later I mean we see that the
 
04:10:42.109 --> 04:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
healthcare industry is changing all the
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
time um
 
04:10:47.229 --> 04:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
but it's the it seems really wrong to
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
deny people because of one decision they
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
make one year that they're going to be
 
04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
have to live with that decision stay on
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
that plan for the rest of their lives
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know even when 10 years later
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
they've developed uh renal failure which
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be a chronic uh condition
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
and very expensive for them and they
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
have no coverage for that
 
04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
fair enough any questions from the
 
04:11:16.040 --> 04:11:18.590 align:start position:0%
fair enough any questions from the
committee

04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
members thank you very much thank
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%

04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors well you know I was looking
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
on the list but okay Peter you you can
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
come first I was going to do represented

nle he was second but you're you're up
 
04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%

you've been on you've been on Medicare
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
longer than all of us in the room my
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
Comm yeah my committee is about to go
 
04:11:54.189 --> 04:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
into executive session and I will be
 
04:11:54.199 --> 04:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
into executive session and I will be
brief

04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
brief
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
because representative lontine basically
 
04:12:00.990 --> 04:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
said it all but I have been watching
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage ever since I turned
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
65 which was 22 years ago amazing okay I
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
like Medicare that's all I've got I my
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
secondary coverage because when I look
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
at Medicare Advantage I go like I was I
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
was born at night but it wasn't last
 
04:12:27.550 --> 04:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
night and when I hear J JJ J what's his
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
name JJ
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
Johnson JJ Walker that's it um or Joe
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
namoth I remember when Joe namoth was
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
vlogging Medicare Advantage and I'm
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
going like this is so good there's got
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
to be like not one catch I I I I look
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
quickly and I'm I wear glasses and I
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
notice that little tiny line underneath
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
and license insurance agent will contact
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
you and I'm going like he ain't going to
 
04:12:58.040 --> 04:12:59.149 align:start position:0%
you and I'm going like he ain't going to
get

04:12:59.149 --> 04:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
me and the bottom line is we have got to
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
do whatever we can do to stop this
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
ripoff of the American public Mr
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
chairman when you said I probably know
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
more about insurance and such and such
 
04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
you've been doing this for what 30 years
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
right here in this room in that chair um
 
04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
and you understand insurance if anybody
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
in this state does so you're not going
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
to get hornswaggled by some flashing
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
lights on television and and but
 
04:13:35.670 --> 04:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of people get hooked
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
in and then they are stuck so anyway
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
that representative lontine said it all
 
04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't have to beat that nail any
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
flatter than that but you guys can do
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
something about this and and that my
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues have been working with the
 
04:13:55.710 --> 04:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
insurance department and I salute the
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner for his provision of
 
04:14:02.590 --> 04:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
staffers to to talk with us about every
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
aspect that we can think about and and I
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
think that uh we've got something that
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
that deserves your thoughtful
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
consideration so thank you very much for
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%

04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
because my gang is waiting for me back
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%

04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
back thank you very much it's always a
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
Peter okay chair we'll call on David
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
worry thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee I'm
 
04:14:46.030 --> 04:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Dave Nagel um trying to figure out
 
04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
how I could add to this conversation um
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
because pragmatically I'm clueless I
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
just turned 65 I'm still in counseling
 
04:14:56.429 --> 04:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
from going to the club yeah and I'm
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
still in counseling from having to go
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
through the process so I got a Tremor in
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
this arm and so I can't hold my needles
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
quite as well as I used to but um I I
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to dwell on that I
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
really wanted to dwell on what I deal
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
with from my role as a physician um I I
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know I never wanted to be a doctor
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
believe it or not I I worked in the
 
04:15:20.429 --> 04:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
tennis industry from the time I was 13
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
till I was
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
25 um I had a broad clientele that aged
 
04:15:28.109 --> 04:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
anywhere from three actually yeah three
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
years old he went on to be the number
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
five ranked tennis player in the world
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's an aside but anyways um to 95 I
 
04:15:38.109 --> 04:15:38.119 align:start position:0%
mean I had amazing experience as a young
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
kid and the weirdest thing about it was
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
that you really learned about the
 
04:15:45.550 --> 04:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
tenuousness of life because you'd be
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with a very able-bodied person
 
04:15:49.870 --> 04:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
who'd be doing just fine one day and
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
then the next day boom something happens
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
and everything changes and now they've
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
got a disability that they didn't have
 
04:15:59.229 --> 04:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
before and you know now that I'm 65 I'm
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
in perfect health I'm a dashingly
 
04:16:03.710 --> 04:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
attractive male and I'm you know God's
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
gift to mankind I I I'm in full denial
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
that anything bad could ever happen to
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
me and that's yeah I'm humble totally I
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just repeating what my wife said
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday so anyway so I you know it's
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
just life is so tenuous and so you know
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
the reason why I wanted to become a
 
04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
doctor was not I found out there was a
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
specialty where we dealt with function
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
and that's Physical Medicine and rehab
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the only thing I wanted to do
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what I did and you know used
 
04:16:40.229 --> 04:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
I'm geriatrics is my thing um I was
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
recruited to come to New Hampshire by
 
04:16:43.950 --> 04:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals I created a lot of
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
geriatric programs and I will tell you
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
that every elderly person I dealt with
 
04:16:51.070 --> 04:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
thought they were fine when they were 65
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
and all of the sudden the stroke
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
happened the spinal cord injury happened
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
just to share two stories with you one
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
um had a gentleman cute onset
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
quadriplegia um wonderful male um his
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
insurance was fine till he was a
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
quadriplegic and then all of a sudden it
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't and um this was the worst thing
 
04:17:15.109 --> 04:17:15.119 align:start position:0%
in my life I mean spinal cord injury is
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
devastating to the person taking care of
 
04:17:19.389 --> 04:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
them and as well as to them but you know
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
we used to have to advise them to do we
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
had to advise them to get a divorce
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
because that was the only way they could
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
get insurance because they would have to
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
get Medicaid otherwise they would be
 
04:17:32.349 --> 04:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
destitute you know what it's like to
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
tell somebody who's been married for a
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
long time that this is the only way we
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
can help you it was like really horrible
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we had that's why I don't do spinal
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
cord injury anymore because I just
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't tolerate it
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
but there's another story that happened
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
right here last year when one of our
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues very able-bodied 70-year-old
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman all of the sudden one day is
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
fine the next day has a
 
04:17:56.429 --> 04:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
stroke and now he's not so able-bodied
 
04:17:58.349 --> 04:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
and he said that was a total wakeup call
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
he never even thought about it so when
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
he was figuring out which insurance to
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
get never even occurred to him that this
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
could happen and he was a very not as
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
smart as you chairman but he was a very
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
smart man and he really thought a lot
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
about you know what but he realized that
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
what his initial selection of insurance
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
would be wouldn't be the same so this is
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
my other concern I I don't have the same
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
negative feelings about Medicare
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
Advantage that other people have said I
 
04:18:29.710 --> 04:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
90% of people are very happy with them
 
04:18:31.870 --> 04:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
but this is the problem that I do have
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
we talked about this earlier the bill
 
04:18:35.149 --> 04:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
that I met with you guys earlier but
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
continuity of care is the most important
 
04:18:38.950 --> 04:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
thing that we do for our
 
04:18:40.830 --> 04:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
patients when you're on a Medicare
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage plan you are stuck with a netw
 
04:18:44.910 --> 04:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
nwor and that Network may be absolutely
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful when you're able-bodied and
 
04:18:48.309 --> 04:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
healthy and whatever but you get this
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
disability and all of a sudden the right
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
guy to teal with your problem is not in
 
04:18:54.109 --> 04:18:54.119 align:start position:0%
your network then what do you
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
do that's a problem last year we talked
 
04:19:00.750 --> 04:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
about prior authorization reform I don't
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
want to say this too loud because the
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
insurers are behind me they're my
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
friends but um we do call it Medicare
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for a reason um sorry but
 
04:19:12.349 --> 04:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
um the reason why has totally to do with
 
04:19:12.359 --> 04:19:13.229 align:start position:0%
um the reason why has totally to do with
priority

04:19:13.229 --> 04:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
priority
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
authorization it's like really hard and
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know it may not be a problem when
 
04:19:19.109 --> 04:19:19.119 align:start position:0%
you're healthy all of a sudden you're
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
not you have to deal with that
 
04:19:24.670 --> 04:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
issue there's a gap here and that's what
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity this bill
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
presents an opportunity we see a gap how
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
do we deal with people with acquired
 
04:19:31.950 --> 04:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
disability when their insurance is no
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
longer working and how do we give them
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
options that are no longer going to make
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
them destitute or whatever is this the
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
right solution I don't know I'm not the
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
right guy but I am here to tell you that
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
there is a problem and we need to fix
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.349 --> 04:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
havee if if I'm on Medicare so mad
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
and from the time I was like 22 or
 
04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
something like that until the time I was
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
65 I saw all these things that you're
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
talking about we're not talking about
 
04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
plans for the 22y old we're talking
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
about plans for 65 and over MH by that
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
time you've kind of seen a lot of
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
stuff I I'm not and we see a lot of
 
04:20:39.309 --> 04:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
insurance things here about people who
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
we under insure themselves thinking that
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to be perfect the rest
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives and we know they're
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
not and you read the news all the time
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
and you know they're
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
not are we trying to fix something
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
because people make very weak
 
04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
decisions I think it you know I I think
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
this issue was already outlined before I
 
04:21:03.790 --> 04:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
got up here I
 
04:21:06.109 --> 04:21:06.119 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of decisions that we make
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
assume perfect knowledge and we don't
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
have perfect knowledge and I I was
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
joking I'm in counseling over this issue
 
04:21:12.319 --> 04:21:13.349 align:start position:0%
joking I'm in counseling over this issue
but

04:21:13.349 --> 04:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm a doc I've been doing this
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
for 40 years I you know I have a brain
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I've had to deal with
 
04:21:21.309 --> 04:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
these issues for a long period of time
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I was beyond overwhelmed by this I
 
04:21:27.309 --> 04:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
also have a disabled son and we're
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with another insurance thing and
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know I've deal with people with
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities my whole life and I was
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by that so if I'm a
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable person that's overwhelmed
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
how does everybody else make decisions
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
when their knowledge is not perfect and
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
so can you blame somebody because they
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
make a decision because they don't have
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
perfect knowledge or perfect whatever
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
and then this was the other thing that
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
bothered me a lot so um I decided I
 
04:21:59.229 --> 04:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
don't know anything so I got a a an
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
insurance guy that helped me with this
 
04:22:03.149 --> 04:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
decision and it turned out he was he was
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful he was absolutely great and
 
04:22:06.429 --> 04:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
then I told that to a bunch of people
 
04:22:08.670 --> 04:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
and they said really and they didn't
 
04:22:10.269 --> 04:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
believe me that he was really helpful I
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
said no no he really was they didn't
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
believe they said for the most part
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
they're not that helpful so if there's
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
nobody to turn to to help you where do
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
you go you know and I mean I think
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we talked about the last
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
time it was here how do we make the
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
whole system dramatically less complex
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can make wise decisions so I
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't think you can blame somebody for
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
making a wise decision when they don't
 
04:22:33.389 --> 04:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge thank you very
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
much oh represent sharesa sorry yes
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
quick question thanks for your question
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
so I understand that l people stay
 
04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
underinsured or when they're healthy is
 
04:22:48.269 --> 04:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
because they want to save on premium so
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
can there a provision something when you
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
jump from there to the insurance plan
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
that suits and covers most of the stuff
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they can increase the premium and
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
not deny you know instead they can ask
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
for more money as a premium and still
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
can cover and switch to the new plan
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
something what do you
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
believe you know what I'm going to defer
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
that question to somebody way smarter
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
than me yeah I I don't disagree with
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
what you just said but I'm not smart
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
enough to answer it
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
right always a pleasure seeing you that
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.070 --> 04:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr chairman as I walk
 
04:23:35.590 --> 04:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
up I see scraps of all the dead bills on
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
the floor here and I hope I hope we
 
04:23:40.030 --> 04:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to join that
 
04:23:42.670 --> 04:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
today so thank you very much chairman
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
hunt members and friends on the house
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee it's always a
 
04:23:49.389 --> 04:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here my name for the
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
record is representative Jonah orrian
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
wheeler I represent the towns of Peter
 
04:23:56.429 --> 04:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
bro and Sharon representative Schmidt
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
says he wasn't born last night well I
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
can say that I was and I'm still here
 
04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
today to say that I think that patients
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
deserve freedom of choice that Medicare
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
disadvantage is clearly not working
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that it is so lotted in
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
our country today and I'm I'm just here
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
to to say you know it's very simple
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
freedom of choice for patients that we
 
04:24:21.070 --> 04:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
have here today you shouldn't be locked
 
04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
into a network or you shouldn't be
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
locked into a certain doctor or a
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
specialist when that spe the other
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
specialist might be right there on the
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring the neighboring network uh
 
04:24:33.070 --> 04:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
we should make the insurance system and
 
04:24:34.830 --> 04:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
the Health Care system work for our
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
patients and not be a boon against the
 
04:24:38.590 --> 04:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
patients you know when we talk about the
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
decisions that they make this is a very
 
04:24:42.990 --> 04:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
complicated system that does not make it
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
easy to make these decisions and the
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
television commercials with all their
 
04:24:48.269 --> 04:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
bells and their whistles and their you
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
know fancy words and their government
 
04:24:53.469 --> 04:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
looking websites make it quite hard it's
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
a it's a charlatan business you know and
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
human beings are susceptible to
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
charlatans even the smartest of us all
 
04:25:04.870 --> 04:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
are susceptible to snake oil salesman
 
04:25:08.590 --> 04:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
and uh that's in large part what these
 
04:25:11.109 --> 04:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
plans can become because you promise a
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
lot and then you don't deliver
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to say I support freedom of
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
choice for our patients this very simple
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan piece of legislation I think
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
should move forward at least in the
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee process as I know each bill
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
of yours does uh I'm sure the doctors
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
and people behind me can answer those
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions a lot more the complex
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
questions which I don't have answers to
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
is as a 22-year-old who doesn't
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
understand the insurance system I've
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
only had insurance for six months Okay
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't anymore well hold on I don't
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
anymore so I don't know if
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
congratulations is in order but
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%

legislation for the patience of the
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and make sure
 
04:25:59.710 --> 04:25:59.720 align:start position:0%

04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
understand fair enough thank

leaves out two segments of our society
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
not by race or gender but by
 
04:27:08.109 --> 04:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
existence in New Hampshire it's legal to
 
04:27:09.630 --> 04:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
discriminate against the elderly and
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
disabled for the sale of Medicare supp
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
policies we have an opportunity to
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
change that to close this loophole in
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law this aspect of
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
insurance has been left to State's
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
rights New Hampshire wouldn't be the
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
first to even the playing field and make
 
04:27:29.469 --> 04:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
insurance companies compete for its
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
members rather than members being
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
trapped in plans for
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
life I was sick when I was serving with
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
you I just didn't know
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
it cancer has had its way with my family
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I've now beat it twice but I didn't
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
get away clean after breast cancer in
 
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
2013 I developed a number of rare
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
illnesses I have CRPS small fiber
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
neuropathy CRPS is complex regional pain
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
syndrome and it's also known as the
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
suicide disease it's the most painful
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
disease known to modern medicine the
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
level of sheer torture causes 70% of the
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
people with it young and old to choose
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
suicide they shouldn't have to go there
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
when there are treatments available but
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
health insurance company deny
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
access when I first found out about the
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
treatment costs of it it led me to
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
nearly sign my DNR the doctor walked in
 
04:28:23.710 --> 04:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
the room and kept asking me if he really
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
had to bring it
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
in I made a big
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
mistake I was at the lowest point in my
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
life and I gave up traditional Medicare
 
04:28:36.030 --> 04:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
for Medicare
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
disadvantage it was supposed to cover
 
04:28:40.950 --> 04:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
everything Medicare did but that and a
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
lot of other things are lies should we
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
be forced to die from one wrong
 
04:28:49.870 --> 04:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
decision for the first few years of
 
04:28:52.429 --> 04:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
receiving infusions they allowed me to
 
04:28:55.389 --> 04:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
end my over two-year confinement in a
 
04:28:58.990 --> 04:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
bed I paid out of pocket for everything
 
04:29:02.950 --> 04:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
I sold everything I resorted to G fundme
 
04:29:04.750 --> 04:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
to continue my treatments because I
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
didn't want to
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
die we suffered two massive hits in our
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
home back to back one of our vehicles
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
was totaled in a driveby shooting and
 
04:29:17.469 --> 04:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
then our rent went up $400 all at once
 
04:29:19.870 --> 04:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
we were on the verge of homelessness so
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
I started rationing my
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
infusions I was declining I had reached
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
a point of talking to my neurologist
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
about what he calls the drug of Last
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
Resort and then in an act of desperation
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
I decided to go after my so-called
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
health insurance and demand that they
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
cover my
 
04:29:39.750 --> 04:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
treatments others had coverage across
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
the country so why not me
 
04:29:45.149 --> 04:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
I chose to go public and I joined
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
people's action care of a cost campaign
 
04:29:50.429 --> 04:29:50.439 align:start position:0%
I learned countless millions are
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
suffering due to delays and denials of
 
04:29:55.630 --> 04:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
care people are languishing in pure
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
torture while prior authorization
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
requests are denied or you get the prior
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
authorization and then they refuse to
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
pay the bill or worse they simply refuse
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
to even let your Dr bill for the service
 
04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
in my case there's a small clause in
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
their contract that allows providers to
 
04:30:15.109 --> 04:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
charge cash and insurance to take a walk
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
on what is life-saving
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
treatment Medicare Advantage Praise on
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
consumer ignorance and it and I sit here
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
after working with all of you and I'm
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
one of those ignorant
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
people they sold me a product and said
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
it covered everything Medicare does but
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
left out the part about having to fight
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
to get that care I have no doubt that
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
every member of this community and this
 
04:30:41.159 --> 04:30:42.550 align:start position:0%
every member of this community and this
committee

04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
has heard horrible statistics of
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
healthcare denial rates what's sicker is
 
04:30:49.109 --> 04:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
that somewhere around 80% of those
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
denials of healthcare services are
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
overruled on appeal but only about 1% of
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
people appeal because you have to do it
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
in a 19th century way through snail mail
 
04:31:01.229 --> 04:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
and writing letters we live in the 21st
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
century yet when I helped present
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
demands to United Healthcare in their
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
own Minnesota
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
Lobby to create an electronic appeals
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
process they refused I know United
 
04:31:14.670 --> 04:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare's own stockholders are
 
04:31:17.309 --> 04:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
demanding change as our Americans both
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats across this
 
04:31:21.630 --> 04:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
country who are tired of the fleecing of
 
04:31:24.910 --> 04:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
America my insurer United Healthcare
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
takes hundreds of billions of dollars in
 
04:31:29.109 --> 04:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
public money and profits by denying
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
people care last year they received a
 
04:31:33.790 --> 04:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
nearly 4% increase in their Medicare
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
dollars yet they raised premium M's
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
51 they took away dental care and they
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
reduced other services this year year so
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
they could still make over
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
$400 billion dollar in
 
04:31:48.319 --> 04:31:50.750 align:start position:0%
$400 billion dollar in
Revenue

04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
billion by the way they make 8 billion
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollar every quarter every three months8
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollar so they increase their
 
04:32:02.910 --> 04:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
income and medical services are taken
 
04:32:05.429 --> 04:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
away meanwhile New Hampshire Services of
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
all party affiliations are trapped on
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans left with
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
scraps of Health Care and we deserve
 
04:32:14.429 --> 04:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
better than that chairman hun I was a
 
04:32:17.070 --> 04:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
Dana Farber cancer patient until United
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
Healthcare took it away I am no longer
 
04:32:21.630 --> 04:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to be treated there my last bill
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
was half in network half out of network
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
I had to go to Senator hasson's office
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
file CMS complaints then I finally got
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
it fixed so much for the no surprises
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
act they paid it half in half out and I
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
was told I can't go there anymore I had
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
that was my routine breast cancer exam
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about nothing difficult
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
Medicare says it's supposed to be
 
04:32:54.429 --> 04:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
covered in full I had a
 
04:32:57.870 --> 04:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
fight and I served with you I got kind
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
of a clue on trying to
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
fight about everybody else let me share
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
one piece of my story though there's one
 
04:33:07.869 --> 04:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
specialist in New Hampshire that has all
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
the treatments I need and more
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
importantly the skills to take care of
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
my rare diseases he was in network when
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
I started going there but like all
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans they can change
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
that any day any month any point
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and we have no
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
choice we get a month maybe two to pick
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
for the year what insurance we're going
 
04:33:33.869 --> 04:33:33.879 align:start position:0%
to take but they can change the rules
 
04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
Midstream too bad for you for almost two
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
years now I've had to go to Senator
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
hasson's office and file complaints with
 
04:33:44.230 --> 04:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
CMS to get attention from United
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
Healthcare to grant me a prior
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
authorization for care then I got to go
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
back to her often to get them to pay the
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
bill after they've issued the prior
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
authorization to
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
care and then go back again to continue
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
to get access to that care over and over
 
04:34:09.150 --> 04:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
and over for almost two years every
 
04:34:13.029 --> 04:34:13.039 align:start position:0%
month every week every day of of my life
 
04:34:16.830 --> 04:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
has been fighting to live to live I
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
die I don't understand United Healthcare
 
04:34:21.760 --> 04:34:24.269 align:start position:0%
die I don't understand United Healthcare
honestly

04:34:24.269 --> 04:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
04:34:26.670 --> 04:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
because why do they keep doing this to
 
04:34:30.670 --> 04:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
me over and over and over again I've
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
been to their headquarters I've been to
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
DC I've spoken to White House Healthcare
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
AIDS they just keep doing
 
04:34:44.109 --> 04:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
it they had admit now get this they
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
admit they don't even have a network to
 
04:34:47.310 --> 04:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
give me the law says they have to
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
provide you a network for this in
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
network out of network thing to work
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
they don't even have a network not only
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
do they not have a network they don't
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
have one single doctor to send me to in
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire not one and
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
care at this point in the mess they
 
04:35:11.310 --> 04:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
actually tried to send me to a clinic
 
04:35:15.070 --> 04:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
that was closed with a doctor that was
 
04:35:17.949 --> 04:35:17.959 align:start position:0%
retired rather than pay my doctor at the
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
in network
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
rate I actually thought they were going
 
04:35:23.551 --> 04:35:23.561 align:start position:0%
to fix this recently because I just went
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
back to Senator Hon's office again and
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
they sent a letter on February 7th
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
saying they were going to look into this
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
they were going to work on this they
 
04:35:32.830 --> 04:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
gave it a case number they gave a phone
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
number they told for my doctor to call
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
to finally solve this and put him in
 
04:35:40.830 --> 04:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
network for me and that was a Friday
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I got a phone call from United
 
04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare telling me it was being
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
denied that they had started the process
 
04:35:48.670 --> 04:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
on January 29th unbeknownst to me or my
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
provider and since they didn't have the
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
records they requested they were going
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
to deny it we could file an appeal so
 
04:35:57.789 --> 04:35:57.799 align:start position:0%
I've had to go back to Senator hen again
 
04:35:59.949 --> 04:35:59.959 align:start position:0%
and file another CMS complaint I was on
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
the phone with this woman from United
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
Healthcare begging her can't you just
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
give the doctor one week just one week
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
to give you the information we only have
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
the letter he's barely had it for 24
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
hours can we please one week she hung up
 
04:36:13.799 --> 04:36:16.029 align:start position:0%
hours can we please one week she hung up
on

04:36:16.029 --> 04:36:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
me I'll never understand why they don't
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
deal with this unless the idea is to
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
stress me out until I'm dead I mean it's
 
04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
been almost two years of living heck
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
with all of
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
this forgive
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
me at least that's the way it
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
feels and I can tell you I could have
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
never imagined this would be my life
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
when I was a first responder
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
a very healthy hardworking EMT I worked
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
emergency room I worked on ambulances I
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
was a tutor an ex a
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
high tutor teaching other students
 
04:36:57.629 --> 04:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
teaching other people how to be EMTs how
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
to save
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
lives politicians are told that Medicare
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
Advantage is so good because of how many
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
people are on it but what they're not
 
04:37:08.429 --> 04:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
told is that we're trapped in it we
 
04:37:10.830 --> 04:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
can't go back I tried can't go back to
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
traditional medic care nobody will sell
 
04:37:15.230 --> 04:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
me a supplemental I got laughed at hung
 
04:37:16.910 --> 04:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
up on and when I called the insurance
 
04:37:18.189 --> 04:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office they told me to
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
talk to the federal government there was
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
nothing they can do the only way to
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
change this for New Hampshire citizen is
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
to change this law and we're not going
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
to be the first there's other states
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
that have done this Maine's got it New
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
York's got it rhod Island's got it we
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
can do it we can choose to do
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
it the only way to go back for
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
traditional medic for me is to pay 20%
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
of every single bill that I get every
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
bill every lab every doctor visit every
 
04:37:49.230 --> 04:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
Everything United Healthcare will
 
04:37:50.830 --> 04:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
probably sit here and tell you that oh
 
04:37:52.470 --> 04:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
she can go to any doctor she wants out a
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
network $75 to walk into his office per
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
visit 50% co-
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.670 --> 04:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
option everybody in New Hampshire
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
deserves to be protected against
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition denials of
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
insurance but in New I'm sure the law
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
literally gives an exception for elderly
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
and disabled people to be discriminated
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
against when it comes to Medicare
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
supplementals if you're born with a hot
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
condition no one can hold that against
 
04:38:25.470 --> 04:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
you till you're 65 or if cancer gets you
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
only in America do people make hard
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
money choices on whether to eat and buy
 
04:38:32.429 --> 04:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
medication rationing their care to try
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
and survive that's grotesque and not the
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
lives we have all paid in for all of you
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
have a chance to be Healthcare Heroes
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in this moment you have the ability
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
to save lives the choice is
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
yours and with that I'll be happy to
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
take any
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions so I'm very sorry to hear
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
about I I guess I only have one question
 
04:38:58.150 --> 04:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
because my understanding was that the
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
Open Enrollment every year you can
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
switch your advantage plan you can
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
switch your advantage plan but there's
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
no point in switching it if nothing is
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
even better all of the advantage plans
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
are primarily the same for me um and and
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%
at this point I've been through such
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
heck with them to start over with
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
another Advantage plan isn't even worth
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
it well I mean give an example he's not
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
in network for any of them United
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare he this provider is in
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
network for United Healthcare except
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
their Medicare Advantage plans they
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
don't have them in network for Medicare
 
04:39:34.109 --> 04:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
Advantage I I hate to do this but how
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
about Anthem none I got nothing have you
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
tried it's all the same and then when
 
04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
you do the chart comparison you get your
 
04:39:45.150 --> 04:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
my medicare book every year when I go
 
04:39:45.160 --> 04:39:45.990 align:start position:0%
my medicare book every year when I go
through

04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
that it's not there's nothing there
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
that's going to offer me better than
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
what I have like I'm not United healthc
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
Care's Insurance could isn't hor
 
04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
horribly like shutting everything out
 
04:40:03.150 --> 04:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
but they shut out so much so and all of
 
04:40:04.510 --> 04:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
them are the same all the Medicare
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans are the same when it
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
comes to this
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
issue you have the co- Insurance the co
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
whatever so now you're in that situation
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
you want to go back to traditional you
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
can't right switching to another
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
Advantage plan isn't going to solve my
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
problem I'm still going to be looking at
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
high deductibles High out- of- pocket
 
04:40:26.910 --> 04:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
costs coverage well say this my
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
understanding was that you you you're
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
saying us Healthcare was telling you
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
can't go but if you switch once a year
 
04:40:37.230 --> 04:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
you get the opportunity to switch to
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
another one and if you switch to Anthem
 
04:40:43.150 --> 04:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
which is act you know a little more
 
04:40:44.310 --> 04:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
active here in the state of New
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you might be getting a better
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
response one I can I will definitely
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
look back into it but when I looked at
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
my mare Medicare book and looked at the
 
04:40:55.230 --> 04:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
charts and weighed it all out it was
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
better to stay with what I had and I
 
04:40:58.628 --> 04:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
actually increased it to get more Dental
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
because they took away all the dental
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm paying more a premium of
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
51 a month so I can have dental care
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
because they took that out of Medicare
 
04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage and they're not the only one
 
04:41:09.310 --> 04:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
the Medicare Advantage is across the
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
board they have increased cost you
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
admitted to the hospital that could be
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
$400 a night on a Medicare Advantage
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
plan okay and that's in network rather
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
another question represent spear so I'm
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get my head around all of
 
04:41:29.550 --> 04:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
this so is is the reason why we need
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill because there's people that
 
04:41:33.868 --> 04:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
want to move from Medicare Advantage or
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare disadvantage or whatever
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's calling it and get back to
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
Medicare but because Medicare doesn't
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
let you do do the
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
supplemental with the pre-existing
 
04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
condition after you're 65 we want to get
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
rid of the pre-existing condition so
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
that you can get back to regular
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
Medicare correct is that what's the Crux
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
of this that's pretty much the Crux of
 
04:41:56.670 --> 04:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
it yes everybody in New Hampshire has
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to buy health insurance and
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
not have pre-existing conditions held
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
against them except for the sale of
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplemental there's literally
 
04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
an exception in New Hampshire law for
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplemental products follow on
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow right but then we'll
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
have the insurance department get up but
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
my what I was hearing was about creating
 
04:42:17.948 --> 04:42:17.958 align:start position:0%
a community rating the comments about
 
04:42:19.708 --> 04:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
Community rating okay so I'm one of the
 
04:42:21.070 --> 04:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
few people in the room knows what that
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
means but so you don't so you you keep
 
04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
like if I try to get a a supplemental
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
right now and I've tried one they won't
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
sell it to me but if I can find somebody
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
to sell it to me they're going to give
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
me a huge premium and they're still
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to deny coverage for certain parts
 
04:42:37.150 --> 04:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
of my care for the first six months to a
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
year imposs back because of that medical
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
underwriting they're going to they're
 
04:42:44.830 --> 04:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
going to uh RIS rate the the risk and
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
therefore the premium would be higher
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
than if they just went back so so yes
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
they want to go back to the supplemental
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
but the supplemental because they hadn't
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
chose it right from the big get-go is
 
04:42:57.070 --> 04:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
now going to be potential higher premium
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
um and the medical r or laugh at you and
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
hang up on you which is what they did I
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
think we Bann pre-existing but what I
 
04:43:03.868 --> 04:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
was thinking with with the whole concept
 
04:43:05.948 --> 04:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
of community rating and we'll find out
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
when the insurance department gets up
 
04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
here but I it sounds like we would have
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
to be they would have to be creating new
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
product for those groups of people who
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
are in this category who are trying to
 
04:43:19.470 --> 04:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
switch back why would there be new new
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
product you have Medicare supplementals
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
already exist but this but you but
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplemental doesn't have a you
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
know is the the it's it was for people
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
who signed up initially to someone
 
04:43:33.480 --> 04:43:34.750 align:start position:0%
who signed up initially to someone
coming

04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
back so if you make I guess what I'm
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out is and and let's
 
04:43:39.788 --> 04:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
have the insurance department explain it
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
let's let's have them explain it to me
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
okay I I would just end with saying that
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know people make we make the best
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
choices we can the people in this room
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
know more information than in the
 
04:43:51.628 --> 04:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
average person so I as a medical
 
04:43:53.310 --> 04:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
professional for 20 years made the wrong
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
choice and I was in a very very
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
unhealthy way when I made that choice so
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
once could argue that I was very much
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of at that time now
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
knowing better I have no way to undo
 
04:44:05.788 --> 04:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
that damage I will possibly pay for it
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
with my
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
Michelle did did I get a card from you
 
04:44:19.708 --> 04:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
too TJ
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
or sorry on mine okay okay all
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman DJ Betton
 
04:44:29.230 --> 04:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
Court commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department joined by Michelle
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
Heaton who heads our life and health
 
04:44:35.948 --> 04:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
Division I want to start by saying that
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
there's one fundamental premise that I
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
certainly 100% agree with
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
with all of the folks who have come to
 
04:44:48.030 --> 04:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
testify which is all of us need to do
 
04:44:52.750 --> 04:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
far better in educating the public about
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
the choices they make when it comes to
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
their Medicare options you know I joke
 
04:45:00.750 --> 04:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
with you sometimes about not getting
 
04:45:03.150 --> 04:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
your Medicare Advantage advice from Joe
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
Amoth and William Shatner and it's a
 
04:45:07.390 --> 04:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a laugh line or chuckle
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
but I think what you've come to
 
04:45:10.350 --> 04:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate from the folks who have
 
04:45:10.360 --> 04:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
appreciate from the folks who have
testified

04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
testified
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
is that it has real consequences to it
 
04:45:17.550 --> 04:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that to the extent that all
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
of us can do better in making it clear
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the public that it's a really big
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
decision to make and you've got to weigh
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
out a number of different factors prior
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
to making that
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
decision it is in fact true and I will
 
04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
tell you it is of great frustration to
 
04:45:37.110 --> 04:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
me that this department does not have
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
any oversight whatsoever of Medicare
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
Advantage I have begged the federal
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
government I have worked in concert with
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
other insurance Commissioners across the
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
country through the National Association
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
of insurance Commissioners in lobbying
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government to give the
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
states back oversight Authority just of
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
the marketing of Medicare Advantage not
 
04:46:03.550 --> 04:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
the programmatic features not any of The
 
04:46:05.430 --> 04:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
Blocking and tackling of the program
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
just the marketing of it and the federal
 
04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
government has politely declined our
 
04:46:13.030 --> 04:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
offer to
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
help and I've put ideas on the table for
 
04:46:16.320 --> 04:46:17.590 align:start position:0%
help and I've put ideas on the table for
shared

04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
shared
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
oversight if they were not inclined to
 
04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
give us back that Authority and we have
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
not gotten anywhere with that and it's a
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
shame because I believe that the states
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
would do a far superior job in providing
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
that oversight in being responsive to
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
Consumer issues as they arise and we
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
have seen very unfortunate situations at
 
04:46:42.990 --> 04:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
the outset where a senior was
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
tricked that's about the best word I can
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
put to it tricked into a Medicare
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
Advantage plan unknowingly had their
 
04:46:53.788 --> 04:46:53.798 align:start position:0%
entire world turned upside down and we
 
04:46:55.948 --> 04:46:55.958 align:start position:0%
have gotten involved in working with
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
that consumer and the federal government
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
to unwind that decision but it is an
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
absolute bear of a process it's very
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
difficult and very timec consuming and
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
that senior is left hanging in the
 
04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
balance and so I am in complete
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
agreement with a lot of what you have
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
heard from those who have testified in
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
terms of doing a better job of alerting
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
the public to the seriousness of the
 
04:47:24.910 --> 04:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
decision the different considerations
 
04:47:26.910 --> 04:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
that need to be taken into account as
 
04:47:28.350 --> 04:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
they make that
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
decision I did have the pleasure as did
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
Michelle and some others in our
 
04:47:33.628 --> 04:47:33.638 align:start position:0%
department of working with the
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from my perspective it is a
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
policy decision for you all to make I
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
always try to be help helpful when
 
04:47:43.390 --> 04:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
somebody comes to the department asking
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
for assistance and for feedback and one
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that I shared with the
 
04:47:50.830 --> 04:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is having testified in
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
front of this committee quite a bit now
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
that one of the questions that was
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
likely to be raised was what might the
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
impact be in terms of cost and they
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
agreed that that was probably something
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
that we needed to look into again
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
assuming that it was going to be raised
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
at some point in your deliberations and
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
so we did the best that we could to
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
gather the data that was available
 
04:48:14.430 --> 04:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
within the time frame that we had and I
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
know some of the sponsors have expressed
 
04:48:19.030 --> 04:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
some skepticism of that data that's fair
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
enough I wouldn't bet my house
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily on what we were able to find
 
04:48:26.590 --> 04:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
again given the time frame that we were
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
given to look into it it was not our
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
typical Deep dive analysis as we've done
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
for say the ambulance report or things
 
04:48:36.270 --> 04:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
um but we can certainly look into it
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
further depending on what the committee
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
decides to do um but again at the end of
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
the day from my perspective it's a
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
policy choice for you all to make uh but
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
I did want to seize on this opportunity
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
to again raise some public awareness of
 
04:48:55.548 --> 04:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that people really need to be
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
careful and thoughtful when they make
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
their decision and that collectively all
 
04:49:02.470 --> 04:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
of us as public servants need to do our
 
04:49:04.750 --> 04:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
part to increase awareness and
 
04:49:07.868 --> 04:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
education about again the pros and cons
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the decision of one over the other
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
and what the
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
potential consequences of choosing one
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
over the other might be and with that
 
04:49:16.990 --> 04:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to Michelle for
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
anything she'd like to
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
add thank you um just some things I
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify because we've heard a
 
04:49:26.350 --> 04:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
lot of different testimony when we're
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
talking about medic these Medicare
 
04:49:30.270 --> 04:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
products there's um kind of three
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
different products there's traditional
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare which are your Medicare A and B
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
that is what um most people are entitled
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
to and you do have to Once you turn 65
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
start paying the premium for Medicare A
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
most I mean for B most people get a free
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
assuming you've been paying into the
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
system and you meet those
 
04:49:51.548 --> 04:49:51.558 align:start position:0%
requirements now if you do nothing you
 
04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
should at least sign up for the Medicare
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
B and you have a and b a is going to um
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
cover your um hos hospital and then B is
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
more of the outpatient type
 
04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
services in addition to that there are
 
04:50:06.390 --> 04:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
other products you can purchase to
 
04:50:08.430 --> 04:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
supplement that traditional Medicare
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
coverage and that's where we get into
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage and Medicare
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
supplement or Med metag
 
04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
Gap metag Gap has been around for a
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
while and that's to bridge that Gap so
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare is going to cover
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
roughly 80% of your cost and the P the
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
um patient is required to pay that
 
04:50:29.638 --> 04:50:30.788 align:start position:0%
um patient is required to pay that
additional

04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
20% that's your cost sharing co-pays all
 
04:50:37.548 --> 04:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
of that stuff um what Med up has done as
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
a product is it bridges that Gap and it
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
covers that those parts that are in that
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
20% now there's a number of different
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
plans and those are the lettered plans
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
you know that some of you may have seen
 
04:50:51.548 --> 04:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
and they have different ranges of
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
coverage amounts so some of them will
 
04:50:55.628 --> 04:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
cover almost everything others will
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
cover you know a percentage of that
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
20% the other plans that we're talking
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
about here are Medicare Advantage
 
04:51:05.788 --> 04:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage Works a little bit
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
differently and these are some of the
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
plans that you can get where you're not
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
paying any additional
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
premium sometimes if you want richer
 
04:51:15.548 --> 04:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
benefits you do have to pay more these
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
plans look and operate more like the
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
traditional hmos or po plans that most
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
people have had throughout their lives
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
um under either employer coverage or if
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
you were on more recent exchange
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
plans those operate very differently in
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have out-of-pocket
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
Maxes you're going to have deductibles
 
04:51:39.070 --> 04:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
co-pays and co-
 
04:51:41.788 --> 04:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
Insurance all of these plans though
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
cover the same benefits essentially
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're all going to cover what a
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare A and B cover the
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
difference for Medicare Advantage is
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
that you're now in a network you may be
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
subject to um prior authorization there
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
could be um different mechanisms in
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that the care you're
 
04:52:04.110 --> 04:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
getting is medically necessary and
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate and that's to bring down
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
overall costs and those are the same
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
types of um ideas we see in you know
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
other insurance products like for the
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
small group Market yes so basically
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're not getting no questions
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
asked versus the advantage is it's going
 
04:52:24.310 --> 04:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
to be the same thing you had through
 
04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
your whole working life very similar yes
 
04:52:32.070 --> 04:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
um they look similar but they do have
 
04:52:33.510 --> 04:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
differences but I think when we're
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
talking about benefits here um I think
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
there's some there were some reference
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
to things not being covered like your
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
Cancer Treatments not being covered they
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
are covered under all of these plans
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
they should be covered however if you're
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
in a Medicare Advantage plan you may
 
04:52:48.590 --> 04:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
need to go to in network providers you
 
04:52:50.670 --> 04:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
may need to pay more in cost shearing
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
there's different um things and you
 
04:52:53.990 --> 04:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
would have to go with what's in your
 
04:52:56.670 --> 04:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
plan but all of those same services are
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to be covered under these plans
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
assuming that they're medically
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
necessary and appropriate they're not
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
going to cover things like experimental
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's the same across the board so
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the big differences
 
04:53:11.788 --> 04:53:11.798 align:start position:0%
between the different um plans you do
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
when you turn 65 you need to make that
 
04:53:15.150 --> 04:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
decision about which route you're going
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
to go if you go to Medicare Advantage
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then you decide you don't want
 
04:53:21.310 --> 04:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage you can always go
 
04:53:24.310 --> 04:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
back to traditional Medicare okay now
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is where the rubber meets the road
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah when you go back what's the
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
consequence the consequence is you're
 
04:53:33.548 --> 04:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
back on traditional Medicare you have
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
that 8020 where you're responsible for
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
paying the 20 at that point you could
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
try to purchase a med set policy
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
however when you're outside of that
 
04:53:44.070 --> 04:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
initial enrollment period from when you
 
04:53:44.080 --> 04:53:44.990 align:start position:0%
initial enrollment period from when you
turn

04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
turn
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
65 the um those products are allowed to
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
do underwriting so they can look at your
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
health history and they can deny you
 
04:53:54.670 --> 04:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
coverage they can also um require you to
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
pay an add like a higher premium than
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
what you would have paid had you signed
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
up for it when you were 65 and for some
 
04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
people with um you know significant
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
medical issues they may not underwrite
 
04:54:07.548 --> 04:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
you for Med up and at that point you
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
will be stuck paying that 20% if you've
 
04:54:13.030 --> 04:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
opted out of your Medicare Advantage so
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
the big difference here is the outof
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
pockets among the um different products
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
and how much you would end up
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
potentially having to pay depending on
 
04:54:23.470 --> 04:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
your health needs and as they change
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
over time so but the coverage is all
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
very similar other than you may need to
 
04:54:32.190 --> 04:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
stay in a network you may have some um
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
restrictions on your ability to access
 
04:54:37.390 --> 04:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
the providers you want to access whereas
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
under traditional Medicare with Med step
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
you can go wherever you want and see
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
whatever providers you want which is one
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the advantages to those products
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
right so to understand what why we're
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
here okay is that so you've you've made
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
that decision you want to go back and
 
04:54:57.390 --> 04:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that they you you have
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
cancer and that and you can't there's
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
there all the supplemental plans
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
say we're that's a pre-existing
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
condition we won't cover that at all so
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
that just means you won't get cover for
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
the 20% yes you have to do the 80 is
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to get but the 20% they're you
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
know you can't find someone who's going
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
to pay the 20% yeah and every company's
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
different so some may want to take on
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
that risk they can use that as a factor
 
04:55:27.390 --> 04:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
to deny you so then um given I know a
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
little bit about health insurance um we
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
have a uh we we have a we you we used to
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
do it age band but the premium
 
04:55:42.430 --> 04:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
difference how much can they rate up if
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
they were going to accept you as the
 
04:55:46.510 --> 04:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition this I assume
 
04:55:47.788 --> 04:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
this is where the community rating
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
conversation came in that how much can
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
more can they charge you from that
 
04:55:57.270 --> 04:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
supplemental plan or is the sky the
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
limit at the end of the day they need to
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
be charging rates that are actuly sound
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
so if it is a huge um increase in the
 
04:56:07.548 --> 04:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
risk they're taking on then yeah the
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
rates will go up proportionately so I
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
think part of what um when we were
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill we did draft a
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm not sure it's posted yet
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
but in our fiscal analysis fiscal note
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
analysis we're estimating that if people
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
are allow if you can't underwrite for
 
04:56:26.110 --> 04:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
health conditions anymore then um rates
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
are going to go up and that's why we try
 
04:56:29.628 --> 04:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
for the supplemental for the
 
04:56:31.230 --> 04:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
supplemental products technically it
 
04:56:33.788 --> 04:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect the advantage plans no
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's only going to go after the ones
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to get into you get back
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the supplemental and that means that
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
it will affect all the people who are in
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
the supplementals yes now which we're
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to be raising all the people who
 
04:56:48.990 --> 04:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
made the right decision we're going to
 
04:56:52.350 --> 04:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
raise their premium for to take care of
 
04:56:54.510 --> 04:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
these people who made a mistake and
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have done the supplemental one
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the issues that I had raised was in
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
theory what you could potentially see
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
are the elements of um adverse selection
 
04:57:09.548 --> 04:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
in the sense that you could have a large
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
flow of people people who
 
04:57:11.440 --> 04:57:13.070 align:start position:0%
flow of people people who
have

04:57:13.070 --> 04:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
expensive conditions moving into med sub
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's obvious we can only assume the
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
reason why you're moving is that you
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
really did have a medical crisis and
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
that you were not and that the turns out
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
that the advantage plan didn't have
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
somebody in network which is a violation
 
04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
right don't we we have Network
 
04:57:33.788 --> 04:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
requirements for all Insurance network
 
04:57:36.910 --> 04:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
aacy requir advantage are not within our
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and they are different
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
requirements than what we we don't
 
04:57:44.030 --> 04:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
regulate their network adequacy no and
 
04:57:46.110 --> 04:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
they no we do not and as Michelle
 
04:57:48.910 --> 04:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned their standards the standards
 
04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
set by the federal government in terms
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
of network adequacy are much different
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
from what we have our H that's one that
 
04:57:57.150 --> 04:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
can be a critical issue yes so one of
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
the things that as I mentioned we tried
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
to look into was for the states that
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
have gone down the pathway of what the
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to do what has their
 
04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
experience been again we were only able
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
to get so far with that analysis
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh there are probably a number of
 
04:58:14.310 --> 04:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
different things that need to be looked
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
into uh in addition to trying to drill
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
down into did they have any adverse
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
selection um elements or Consequences to
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
it you know I think boiling down what
 
04:58:27.548 --> 04:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
you've heard the problem with Medicare
 
04:58:29.708 --> 04:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
Advantage amongst a number of things is
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
the networks can often times be lousy
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the types of doctors and Specialists
 
04:58:36.868 --> 04:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
that people need when they have very
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
complicated unique yeah things
 
04:58:40.990 --> 04:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
conditions that's right
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay so if I make sure I understand the
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
problem so we all is when someone
 
04:58:47.160 --> 04:58:48.628 align:start position:0%
problem so we all is when someone
switches

04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
switches
 
04:58:51.628 --> 04:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
back um
 
04:58:56.190 --> 04:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
the the financial consequence is that
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
they can't just switch back and get what
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
they should have had should have signed
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
up for in the first place okay right
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
there's a penalty there you know there
 
04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a penalty from
 
04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
switching from the advantage come to
 
04:59:11.350 --> 04:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
come back and the government the federal
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
government hasn't set a penalty rate
 
04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no standard of what a
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
penalty is other than the fact that the
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
the supplemental insurance companies
 
04:59:24.430 --> 04:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
will now get a choice to decide whether
 
04:59:27.150 --> 04:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
they'll even take you and what premium
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
they'll offer you if they offer you
 
04:59:32.590 --> 04:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
anything and the odds are it's going to
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
be very high because you are in a very
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
unique class that you're switching over
 
04:59:39.390 --> 04:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
to them the the big the biggest penalty
 
04:59:40.750 --> 04:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
you speak of Mr chairman is being
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
subjected to underwriting at that point
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
and not guaranteed issue which is back
 
04:59:47.670 --> 04:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
way back when when I first cut my teeth
 
04:59:50.590 --> 04:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
on 7-Eleven and if the situation is dire
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
enough the Medicare supplemental carrier
 
04:59:55.548 --> 04:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
at that point can choose not to write
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
you at all right you have to find
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
someone who's is willing to write you
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's right yes and generally speaking
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
the older you are when you purchase that
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
mud St you're going to pay higher rates
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
typically but there's a lot of factors
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
that go into it the type of plan goes
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
into it and when we were doing some
 
05:00:12.670 --> 05:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
analysis and looking at some of the
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
other states we didn't see any other
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
states in our initial analysis that have
 
05:00:19.830 --> 05:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
done what's being proposed in this bill
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variations to it and
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
caveats to that and just looking at the
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
rates in those States um you know they
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
are higher for the most part than what
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
we are currently seeing here there's a
 
05:00:32.750 --> 05:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
lot of other factors that go into it
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
other than underwriting because this
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
bill just simply says they got to carry
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
the same rate right is that what this
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill does no this is still allow to do
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
some medical underwriting or they what
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
was the community rating what are we
 
05:00:46.350 --> 05:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
having a community we creating a new
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
insurance product a community of people
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
who are switching back no fundamentally
 
05:00:52.030 --> 05:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
what it does is it says that guaranteed
 
05:00:54.750 --> 05:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
issue rights are extended throughout the
 
05:00:54.760 --> 05:00:56.190 align:start position:0%
issue rights are extended throughout the
individual's

05:00:56.190 --> 05:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
individual's
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
life when they're looking to go into
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
meds up yeah you can't use Health
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
factors as a basis you're Banning the
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
medical underwriting
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah which was a fundamental you can we
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
do that I mean isn't that a fundamental
 
05:01:11.110 --> 05:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
part of the we have jurisdiction over
 
05:01:13.548 --> 05:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplemental products okay
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's a a Nuance in our jurisdiction
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we have no oversight of Medicare so
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this bill do we run
 
05:01:21.788 --> 05:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
the risk of that these supplemental
 
05:01:23.548 --> 05:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
companies will pull out of the state
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
well that was what I was trying to look
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
into that's what I was trying to
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
determine and as I've said you know some
 
05:01:30.510 --> 05:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
initial data points that came back
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
suggested that there is upward pressure
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
on premiums but again we didn't have the
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
time or the ability to do the Deep dive
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
to to factor in all of the different
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
components that went into why things
 
05:01:44.430 --> 05:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
were the way they were in the states
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
that have done this or some something
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
it got it representative Gibbs thank you
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um do Medicare Advantage plans
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
in fact have a higher uh denial rate
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
than the combination of traditional
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicare supplemental
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
totally we don't have any data on
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage because we have no
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate them so I don't
 
05:02:12.548 --> 05:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
know exactly how their claims are
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
administered um we also don't have
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
claims data necessarily on traditional
 
05:02:19.470 --> 05:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
Medicare um Tri uh
 
05:02:19.480 --> 05:02:21.390 align:start position:0%
Medicare um Tri uh
Medicare

05:02:21.390 --> 05:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
sub operates a little bit differently so
 
05:02:26.430 --> 05:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
we would have to do some digging but we
 
05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
could look into that potentially and see
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
what data we do have available to us and
 
05:02:32.910 --> 05:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of Medicare and Medicare
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
Advantage that data is maintained by the
 
05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
federal government we would have to see
 
05:02:38.110 --> 05:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
if the federal government would make it
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
available to us maybe it is maybe it is
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
in some places I'm because we don't deal
 
05:02:43.948 --> 05:02:43.958 align:start position:0%
we have someone here who claims that
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
he's got he's got the DAT bring on up um
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
again because this because Medicare
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
Advantage is not a lane we we typically
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
operate in because we don't have
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority we just don't
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
maintain data the way we do the products
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
that we do representative sesa yeah
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
quick question uh thanks for the
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
question uh so do people take Medical
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
Advantage is because the premium is
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
lower much lower or zero it's
 
05:03:13.150 --> 05:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
zero it's
 
05:03:16.590 --> 05:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
nothing okay very
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
appealing and they send you lots of
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
mailing and uh followup question
 
05:03:24.910 --> 05:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
followup question please quick so when
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
when they sell this Medical Advantage
 
05:03:29.070 --> 05:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
plan do they do they advertise that once
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
you take this you cannot go back to
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
traditional I think that speaks to the
 
05:03:36.510 --> 05:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
marketing piece and again very very
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
problematic there some have higher
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
ethical thresholds than others in terms
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
of making that information known to the
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
consumer but I have to say for myself
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
personally it was this is not rocket
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
science when when when someone else is
 
05:03:54.190 --> 05:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
say you charging you okay you're
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
supplemental and they break the
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental into two because they put
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
the drug is kept separately so you have
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
two different
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
supplementals okay and then they said
 
05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then go over the advantage well well
 
05:04:07.548 --> 05:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to cover everything drugs
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
everything for nothing I mean come on
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
buyer beware I mean where's the
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
catch well yeah the catch is you're
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
locked into it and it's and and you say
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
is well people were buffaloed or scared
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
or but it's a simple consumer beware
 
05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
when when you're when you're looking at
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
paying over $100 and you know I think
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
the first year I did it I did it the
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
normal way and I did it for my wife cuz
 
05:04:35.788 --> 05:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
she she turned over before me
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
but I pay like $160 a month and then
 
05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage is nothing so it's I mean it's
 
05:04:45.230 --> 05:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
not rocket science to say to what's the
 
05:04:45.240 --> 05:04:46.310 align:start position:0%
not rocket science to say to what's the
catch

05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
catch
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
here represent um just okay thank you
 
05:04:53.070 --> 05:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um my
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
understanding now is if I'm in a lower
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
tier supplemental plan I might not be
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
able to go to a upper tier plan correct
 
05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
no I've been told that by
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
my yeah that could be the case
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
but this might change that and make it
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
possible so the way this bill is
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
currently written is not going to change
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
that I think we've been talking about a
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
lot of different ideas here and I don't
 
05:05:22.110 --> 05:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
think all of those ideas made it into
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
this bill um so I if that's what I think
 
05:05:28.990 --> 05:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
it comes down to the policy makers if
 
05:05:30.548 --> 05:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
you guys can tell us what you want to
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
achieve we can help draft it in a way
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
that that's going to happen we got to
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
figure out the
 
05:05:37.150 --> 05:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
problem I think there's the way this
 
05:05:39.150 --> 05:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
bill is currently drafted I think there
 
05:05:41.230 --> 05:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
are some some technical issues with it
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
we did raise those issues to the sponsor
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
um some of them being that we have no
 
05:05:48.548 --> 05:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate Medicare Advantage
 
05:05:50.548 --> 05:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
so some of that needs to be cleaned up
 
05:05:53.548 --> 05:05:53.558 align:start position:0%
but I think um what we would need from
 
05:05:56.110 --> 05:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
the policy or the decision makers here
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
is like what policy do you think is
 
05:06:01.470 --> 05:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate and how can we help you
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
achieve that and that's why we are
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated to you know doing additional
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
research on these issues so that you
 
05:06:08.590 --> 05:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding of you know
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
if you pull this lever what is that
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
going to mean in terms of Premium what
 
05:06:13.230 --> 05:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
is that going to mean in terms of the
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
market stability all of those issues but
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're just not able to do that in the
 
05:06:19.230 --> 05:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
short amount of time right now for you
 
05:06:21.628 --> 05:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
guys to act on this bill we would need a
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
many months to do that the question I
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
posed to you I believe is correct that
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh you you might not be able to qualify
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
for a a higher tier program so just uh
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
maybe make sure of that thank and I had
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
made a commitment to the stakeholders
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
that I'll reiterate today which is we're
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
happy to work with them to get this bill
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
to do what they intend for it to do what
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
I also said was we needed some direction
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
from all of you as to where you wanted
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
us to go and what you wanted to focus on
 
05:06:50.110 --> 05:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
what you had an appetite for what you
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have an appetite for so sorry to
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
put the ball back in your court you ran
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%

05:07:35.430 --> 05:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
State Commission on Aging is part of
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
state government we're a 26 member
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
commission um uh created to with a key
 
05:07:43.390 --> 05:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
charge to advise the governor and the
 
05:07:46.030 --> 05:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
legislature on issues related to aging
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
and this is in response to the uh to the
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
rapid uh permanent transformational
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
demographic shift our state is
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
undergoing so um I'm primarily going to
 
05:07:58.350 --> 05:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
address two uh parts of this bill the
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
change in number one the change in uh
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
rating methodology for Medicare
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
supplemental policy so in HRA from
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
maintained age at time of purchase to um
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh rating to community rating
 
05:08:12.990 --> 05:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
and the second part about um the to the
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
requirement for Medicare supplemental
 
05:08:16.830 --> 05:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
policies to cover pre-existing
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
conditions so the New Hampshire State
 
05:08:21.310 --> 05:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging recognizes the high
 
05:08:23.628 --> 05:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
cost of Medicare supplementum plans and
 
05:08:25.628 --> 05:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
the burden felt by New Hampshire's older
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
adults to afford the product uh as
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
healthc care costs go up so so do the
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
costs of these plans the challenges is
 
05:08:36.430 --> 05:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
that at a population level as we age our
 
05:08:38.830 --> 05:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
income declines the commission
 
05:08:40.990 --> 05:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
recommends public policy like Community
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
rating that keeps plans from being the
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
costliest when people can least afford
 
05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
it so at at one point uh continuing the
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
conversation about uh the rating
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
methodology at one point the New
 
05:08:54.910 --> 05:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department rules
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
required issue age rating for all
 
05:09:00.190 --> 05:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
Medicare supplemental plans sold in New
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire annual increases for this
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
rating model are only subject to general
 
05:09:07.948 --> 05:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
cost rising cost of the of providing the
 
05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
plan with this me methodology moral
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
hazard is limited um as there is still
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
an incentive to buy a a robust plan
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
while younger as changing plans at older
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
ages results in a person having the same
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh plan as their same age neighbor but
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
paying more for it as the neighbor
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
purchased their plan at a younger age in
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
comparison the current methodology in
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
used attained in use attained age
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
results in plans with annual increases
 
05:09:39.150 --> 05:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
subject to two variables a person's age
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh increased age and the general riseing
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
cost of of um of providing the plan this
 
05:09:48.270 --> 05:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
makes plans most costly when when people
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
are of more advanced ages when they have
 
05:09:53.548 --> 05:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
the least resources to pay for the high
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
rates if the commi if this committee
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
decides against Community rating the
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging highly recommends
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
legislating a requirement for issue age
 
05:10:04.590 --> 05:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
rating for Medicare supplemental policy
 
05:10:06.750 --> 05:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
sold in New
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so moving on to talk about
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
regarding uh guaranteed issue the
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
coverage of preexisting conditions
 
05:10:16.510 --> 05:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
advocates for the status quo uh suggest
 
05:10:18.190 --> 05:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
that changes in this bill would in
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
increase uh will introduce increased
 
05:10:23.470 --> 05:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
moral hazard more people may choose
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
cheaper products with fewer benefits
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
when they are healthier and opt for more
 
05:10:29.788 --> 05:10:29.798 align:start position:0%
expensive p uh uh products which will
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
become more expensive under this bill as
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
they exchange uh as they age and
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
experience more health conditions this
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
is not uh limited to moving between
 
05:10:40.990 --> 05:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
various medic uh Gap plan options but
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
also includes opting for Medicare
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
Advantage rather than traditional
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicare Advantage is alluring
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
as is in that as you as we've already
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussed here today there's no need to
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
purchase a Medicare supplemental plan uh
 
05:10:55.788 --> 05:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
and that it also includes often includes
 
05:10:57.310 --> 05:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
benefits such as prescription drug
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
coverage dental and vision
 
05:11:02.110 --> 05:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
care the commission questions how
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
significant the moral hazard the lack of
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
incentive to guard against risk where
 
05:11:08.310 --> 05:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
one is protected from consequences in
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
this market choosing coverage is
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
complicated fully understanding the the
 
05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
consequences of the choices is
 
05:11:17.948 --> 05:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
complicated it is so complicated that
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government provides public
 
05:11:22.270 --> 05:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
resources in every state for options
 
05:11:24.430 --> 05:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
counselors to help people make informed
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
decisions yet this resource is extremely
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
limited appointments during open
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment periods at our aging and
 
05:11:33.430 --> 05:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
disability Resource Centers book out
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
very very
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
fast the commission has heard from
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
people who have chosen Medicare
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans not realizing that when
 
05:11:43.868 --> 05:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
they made the choice um uh two about two
 
05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
distinct challenges with the product
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
number one we've discussed already about
 
05:11:50.110 --> 05:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
network adequacy uh networks of care
 
05:11:52.110 --> 05:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
providers are significantly Limited in
 
05:11:53.788 --> 05:11:53.798 align:start position:0%
comparison to traditional Medicare
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
providers especially in the more rural
 
05:11:57.948 --> 05:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
areas of our
 
05:12:00.750 --> 05:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
state and and I say this in particular
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
um we many examples have been brought up
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
but uh one common example has not and
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is um post hospitalization needing
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
for skilled nursing facility care try
 
05:12:12.990 --> 05:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
and find one up in the north country and
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
Network and and when you're post
 
05:12:17.470 --> 05:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital you want to be close to your
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
home community and your family and
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
friends who can support you um to get
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
you back into your your your everyday
 
05:12:27.310 --> 05:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
life um and as was already mentioned uh
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
network adequacy uh when somebody was in
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
an HMO plan when they were younger our
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire insurance department uh
 
05:12:35.708 --> 05:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
overseas to make sure that there's an an
 
05:12:37.708 --> 05:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
adequate Network the federal government
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
as um uh commissioner Ben Court said
 
05:12:41.708 --> 05:12:41.718 align:start position:0%
does have different standards of network
 
05:12:44.070 --> 05:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy and that's where we've heard um
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
we've gotten the most uh feedback um
 
05:12:49.948 --> 05:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
from uh from the
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
um uh and the second part of it Beyond
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
Network AC the Second Challenge I just
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
want to raise is is that face value
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans seem like the
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
most cost-effective option yet according
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
to Kaiser Family Foundation analysis
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare beneficiaries with
 
05:13:11.470 --> 05:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
metap are less likely to report cost
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
related problems than similar Medicare
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
enrollees Medicare Advantage uh share of
 
05:13:20.590 --> 05:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
the market has grown substantially in
 
05:13:23.190 --> 05:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in in the past few years
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
in 2018 it was uh just they had just
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
133% of the market share as of September
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
2024 it was 35% of the market share
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
guaranteed issue uh could provide a
 
05:13:36.750 --> 05:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
level of consumer protection though it
 
05:13:38.350 --> 05:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
does raise the Spectre of increasing
 
05:13:40.350 --> 05:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
product costs and reducing uh providers
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the market to that to that point uh
 
05:13:45.868 --> 05:13:45.878 align:start position:0%
ADV Advocates of the status quo argue
 
05:13:48.110 --> 05:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
that the best way to keep rates low are
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
to have a healthy market for Medicare
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental policies they suggest that
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
these changes will uh cause Medicap
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
providers to discontinue sales in New
 
05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as it as it increases their
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
exposure uh to risk the question is how
 
05:14:05.070 --> 05:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
do you define a healthy um Market what
 
05:14:06.310 --> 05:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
is the
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
um what what is the threshold with
 
05:14:11.070 --> 05:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
enough providers enough products uh for
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
a healthy Market the Commission on Aging
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
really does not have a a solid answer to
 
05:14:17.430 --> 05:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
this question uh we can say that as of
 
05:14:19.350 --> 05:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
March 2024 the New Hampshire Ins
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance Department listed 20 different
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
companies selling Medicare supplemental
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
plans in New Hampshire each offering at
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
a minimum four offerings three for
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
people who were eligible after TW uh
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
2020 uh um with a majority of the uh
 
05:14:37.708 --> 05:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
companies offering uh more options with
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
one company offering up to to 10
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
different options
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
um and there is also in addition in this
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill there is a requirement for Medicare
 
05:14:51.150 --> 05:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
Advantage plan providers um to also
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
offer medic um um Medicare supplemental
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
plans so so the question of of of of you
 
05:14:59.708 --> 05:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
know will this disrupt the market that's
 
05:15:03.310 --> 05:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
a question for for you all to decide so
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for your time today and
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
05:15:10.510 --> 05:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh well we so
 
05:15:12.030 --> 05:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
am I understanding you correctly that
 
05:15:13.670 --> 05:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
even though I'm not paying with my
 
05:15:16.230 --> 05:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
advantage not paying anything now when I
 
05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
anymore in what part are you referencing
 
05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
are you talking so my medicare I'm I'm
 
05:15:29.670 --> 05:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage so in Medicare Advantage you
 
05:15:31.948 --> 05:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
are you are if you stay with Advantage
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
you have what you have um but so I will
 
05:15:38.110 --> 05:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
have my zero for the for my entire life
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
so if I lived be 90 years old I still
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be at zero for my advantage plan
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
so I I will say that that there's people
 
05:15:49.868 --> 05:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
in this room who are better able to
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
answer that question but I am saying in
 
05:15:55.070 --> 05:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
the very beginning is is is that um when
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
you go to buy um Medicare supplemental
 
05:16:01.628 --> 05:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
policies the older you are with the way
 
05:16:05.470 --> 05:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
the rating is done now um well and it's
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
but it's significantly um more costly it
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
will go up in other words if I stayed in
 
05:16:12.910 --> 05:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
the traditional the one that everybody
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
wants to switch back to yeah as they get
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
older it's going to get more and more
 
05:16:20.350 --> 05:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
expensive yes yes because you're not
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
doing a good job of tell telling us the
 
05:16:25.230 --> 05:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
disadvantage but
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay when I was talking about the
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
disadvantage I where I was talking about
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
is the network adequacy adequacy is
 
05:16:33.628 --> 05:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
definitely an issue we deal with that in
 
05:16:35.310 --> 05:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
this committee we're very very much in
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
tune to that problem okay represent is
 
05:16:38.080 --> 05:16:39.788 align:start position:0%
tune to that problem okay represent is
Speer

05:16:39.788 --> 05:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
Speer
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
you said it uh thank you you said it
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
very quickly so I just wanted to make
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
sure I heard what you said you talk
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
almost as fast as I
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
do she might be from Brooklyn too no no
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
no did you say that it is possible that
 
05:17:00.788 --> 05:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
we might create or somehow get created a
 
05:17:03.030 --> 05:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
supplemental oh I'm so sorry if I was I
 
05:17:08.430 --> 05:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
confused folks I'm not talking about
 
05:17:09.990 --> 05:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage does if you have
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage you have no need to
 
05:17:14.830 --> 05:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
purchase a supplemental policy um it's
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh if you have traditional Medicare you
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
may you don't you do not have to choose
 
05:17:20.040 --> 05:17:20.708 align:start position:0%
may you don't you do not have to choose
a

05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental but there are no caps on
 
05:17:24.110 --> 05:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
out-of- pocket payments with traditional
 
05:17:26.910 --> 05:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare so so that is why people choose
 
05:17:30.548 --> 05:17:30.558 align:start position:0%
to buy a supplemental product um a and
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill is seeking to do is
 
05:17:36.070 --> 05:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
change the way that product is is um
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
constructed so that it it's about the
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
rating how they set rates for it so
 
05:17:42.548 --> 05:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
right now it's attained age so every
 
05:17:45.628 --> 05:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
every year you go um age your the cost
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
goes up it goes goes up by two variables
 
05:17:50.310 --> 05:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
one is because the cost of the product
 
05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
goes up claims are costs are going up
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of healthcare is going up and
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
the other is that you've gotten a year
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
older if you if this if this was there's
 
05:18:00.350 --> 05:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
three ways that Medicare supplemental
 
05:18:02.590 --> 05:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
plans are are are rated so that's one
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
way that's how our state is currently
 
05:18:06.430 --> 05:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
doing it at one point in the past New
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did do um um um issue age
 
05:18:13.070 --> 05:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
rating so when you were 65 age banding
 
05:18:15.310 --> 05:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
we called it age banding okay okay so
 
05:18:16.990 --> 05:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
when with the traditional Community
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
rating was that New York when they first
 
05:18:22.628 --> 05:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
did it did the true Community rating and
 
05:18:25.150 --> 05:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
that means there was no age banding no
 
05:18:27.548 --> 05:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
matter how old you were you paid the
 
05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
same premium price we in New Hampshire
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
battled over from 3:1 4 to one I think
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're you know maybe we got six to one
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
but that meant the Young youngest the
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
lowest premium uh compared to the
 
05:18:43.548 --> 05:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
highest premium of the person who's the
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
oldest what what's that band and I've
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
always said our problem was that we
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
could never get the right
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
ratio yeah I I think you need a
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
whiteboard in this room because it's
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
best done on a on a chart to be able to
 
05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
look at the way um the different rating
 
05:19:03.030 --> 05:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
mechanisms work so and the Third Way is
 
05:19:05.310 --> 05:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
community rating so there's the yeah the
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
issued age the attained age and
 
05:19:09.390 --> 05:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
Community rating but Community rating is
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
one flat number for everybody regardless
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
of your age and like I said um you know
 
05:19:17.788 --> 05:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
we we never went there in New Hampshire
 
05:19:19.548 --> 05:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
we never went to a true Community yeah
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
it makes it more um expensive for
 
05:19:25.708 --> 05:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
younger folks the the 65y old but it
 
05:19:28.270 --> 05:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
makes um but it makes it less expensive
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
for the 85y old and and what we're
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting with the chart here with the
 
05:19:35.548 --> 05:19:35.558 align:start position:0%
um chart on the first page is well your
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
income decreases the population on
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
average so that the income decreases as
 
05:19:42.990 --> 05:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
you age so it should be we would call
 
05:19:46.990 --> 05:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
that reverse age banding because the way
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
we did our an was the youngest paid the
 
05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
lowest premium the oldest paid the
 
05:19:56.430 --> 05:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
highest and you want to flip that yes
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
yes yeah whoa what a radical idea a
 
05:20:03.390 --> 05:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
radical radical but you know by 2030 um
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
close to 30% of our state is going to be
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
um over the age of 65 so we're coming
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
from your position in commission of
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
Aging I think that's a wonderful
 
05:20:16.590 --> 05:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion for us to think about but um
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
that is a big tough pillow to swallow
 
05:20:19.990 --> 05:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
because they have you have to then
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
decide what is the where's the this is
 
05:20:23.948 --> 05:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
the bell curve where's the where's the
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
the B you know are we going to go to the
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
top of the curve but yeah yeah so that
 
05:20:29.070 --> 05:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
that that's the advantage of community
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
rating and and that would be a benefit
 
05:20:34.990 --> 05:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
but it but as I said um um issue AED
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
would be better than even issue aged
 
05:20:38.350 --> 05:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
would be better than what we have right
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um you
 
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the um cost of the
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
premiums goes up as the policy holder
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
ages um does it go up just for new
 
05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
enroles that is when you enroll if you
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
hadn't enrolled when you were 65 it's
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
now going to be higher um if you're
 
05:21:06.030 --> 05:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
older say if you're 80 or 90 um or does
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
it go up continually or periodically for
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
current policy
 
05:21:15.788 --> 05:21:15.798 align:start position:0%
holders so I I'm first going to say that
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
I am sure the folks at the New Hampshire
 
05:21:18.270 --> 05:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
insurance department could answer this
 
05:21:19.910 --> 05:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
question much better than I about these
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
various um um rating mechanisms and how
 
05:21:27.310 --> 05:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
that works but it to my understanding um
 
05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
with with the current attained age
 
05:21:32.910 --> 05:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
rating your rate goes up every year
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
because the cost of the product goes up
 
05:21:36.510 --> 05:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
the of providing the product goes up but
 
05:21:38.948 --> 05:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
also because you're a year older so so
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
it goes up every year um um by those two
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
factors if it was issued age and you
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
bought it when you were 65 it would only
 
05:21:51.510 --> 05:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
go up because of the cost of Health Care
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and and and and the cost of providing
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
the product it wouldn't go up because
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
you you got another year older so that
 
05:22:00.590 --> 05:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
benefits somebody who buys it at 65 at
 
05:22:03.030 --> 05:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
75 if I you know so my neighbor bought
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
it at 65 and they got at this rate so
 
05:22:06.750 --> 05:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
their price for that particular product
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
is this the same product I'm choosing at
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
at 75 oh I want to switch to that
 
05:22:13.548 --> 05:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
product it's it's I'm buying it at 75
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's my issued a issued age it's going
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be for the same product it's going to
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
be more money but it but it it it um
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
sort of takes away that that um that
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
question of of of um moral hazard away
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not just going to get
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
a cheap when I get a cheap product with
 
05:22:31.230 --> 05:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
little little benefits when I'm healthy
 
05:22:32.910 --> 05:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
and then I'll buy something more
 
05:22:34.990 --> 05:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
expensive later that's you know there
 
05:22:36.270 --> 05:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
there's you know for the people who are
 
05:22:38.310 --> 05:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about a gaming of the system
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
but the community rating will keep it so
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
that uh the product price will still go
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
up every year because the cost of
 
05:22:47.070 --> 05:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
providing the product goes up but it
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
age great thank you okay thank you I
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
think I got it I did that okay insurance
 
05:22:57.360 --> 05:22:58.470 align:start position:0%
think I got it I did that okay insurance
department

05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:23:00.990 --> 05:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
people right you know basically we're
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
when I say it's a bell curve because
 
05:23:06.190 --> 05:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
right now our age banding it goes to 65
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
because the Medicare 65 kicks in so we
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
are your premium is lowest when you are
 
05:23:13.868 --> 05:23:13.878 align:start position:0%
a young person and then it's highest
 
05:23:16.868 --> 05:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
when you get to 65 what she suggesting
 
05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
is at
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
65 that you either we go Community
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
rating a flat rate for everybody in the
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental or if we're really going to
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
try to entice people to say supplemental
 
05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
is not such a bad idea that we would do
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
the reverse bell curve where the premium
 
05:23:37.150 --> 05:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
would be higher when you just turned 65
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
but then would go down
 
05:23:42.628 --> 05:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
as you got older did I get it
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
right that's not yes but that's not
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
possible I recognize the the boundaries
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
here there's three different types of
 
05:23:50.910 --> 05:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
rating that's what you were we got we
 
05:23:52.990 --> 05:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
got to choose between those three okay
 
05:23:53.000 --> 05:23:54.190 align:start position:0%
got to choose between those three okay
thank

05:23:54.190 --> 05:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
you uh all right so um we have uh four
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
James fresher
 
05:24:05.788 --> 05:24:05.798 align:start position:0%
fresher yeah and your name is on here on
 
05:24:09.070 --> 05:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
top so I'm calling you because
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
but I know it's James Fisher what is
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
your name sir Fisher oh this is okay
 
05:24:16.868 --> 05:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
yeah and and actually if it's okay with
 
05:24:18.750 --> 05:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
the chair I would uh I would like to
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
defer yes that's fine I wasn't sure I
 
05:24:23.788 --> 05:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
was I was just guessing CU he's numers
 
05:24:25.548 --> 05:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
so Dapper and his dresser that he that
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
was and I was looking at the handwriting
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
so I had the wrong person but I somehow
 
05:24:34.350 --> 05:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
I I think you guys been here before I
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
think I've seen you before so I should
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so all I can say is we we'
 
05:24:51.310 --> 05:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
really I think we've all got what's
 
05:24:53.230 --> 05:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
going on here so please don't repeat
 
05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
anything we've already heard I'll try
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
not try to be right to the point maybe
 
05:24:58.350 --> 05:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
you can answer that question that she
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
had sure so let me introduce myself if I
 
05:25:03.150 --> 05:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
might um and thank you to yourself uh
 
05:25:04.708 --> 05:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative hunt and this committee
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
for really
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
tackling a a major consumer affairs
 
05:25:12.990 --> 05:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
issue that's what you guys do so thanks
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
I am a
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
geriatrician I've practiced and still
 
05:25:18.670 --> 05:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
practicing in New Hampshire for the past
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
43 years a geriatrician takes care of
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
elderly patients that's what I do the
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
old old that's my the nature of what I
 
05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
do and I will say that there's been
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony from younger people
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
as well as older people about the
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
reality of the necessity for reform it
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
may or may not be exactly as this Bill
 
05:25:41.590 --> 05:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
proposes um so the reason for this
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislation just to
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
review is the inability of ill
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries to disenroll from Medicare
 
05:25:51.548 --> 05:25:51.558 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans that don't meet their
 
05:25:53.430 --> 05:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
medical or financial
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
needs so that seems to fall within the
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
province of this committee thank you um
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
and this bill facilitates uh allowing
 
05:26:03.990 --> 05:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
those uh medical um Insurance products
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
to exist right now people cannot even
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
just rate them they're not available
 
05:26:10.270 --> 05:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
many of my patients who try to leave
 
05:26:13.150 --> 05:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage will not find a
 
05:26:14.590 --> 05:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental Bill they're just not
 
05:26:17.070 --> 05:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
offered forget the fact that it's that
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's U medically underwritten that they
 
05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
can't afford it they're not offered so
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
if I might um this bill guarantees it at
 
05:26:27.310 --> 05:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
least is a effort which you guys may
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
work out further details on um to
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
guarantee that metag plans are available
 
05:26:34.390 --> 05:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
beyond that initial period of
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
Eligibility This is complicated not
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room has gray hair
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
here so you haven't been through the
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
process as we've heard so I have some
 
05:26:43.470 --> 05:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
background here as as representative
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
hunt has also
 
05:26:47.230 --> 05:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
described to to be aware there's an
 
05:26:49.230 --> 05:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
initial enrollment period when someone
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
turns 65 or becomes eligible for
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare um at that period metag Gap
 
05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
plans the these supplementals are also
 
05:27:00.270 --> 05:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
called metag Gap are
 
05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed at um uh um
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
various um formats through all states by
 
05:27:13.628 --> 05:27:13.638 align:start position:0%
the way you can have both um age and
 
05:27:15.510 --> 05:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
Community rating simultaneously you
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
could have a tained age you could have
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
age at issue um every state has decided
 
05:27:22.030 --> 05:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
to do this in a different fashion that
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
benefits its population and I think New
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has not um tended to be as
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
directive as other states in offering
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
Community rating which makes it
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
affordable I I do want to say um that we
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
were talked a little bit about the
 
05:27:42.030 --> 05:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the senior um but you
 
05:27:44.590 --> 05:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
know if you're um living paycheck to
 
05:27:46.910 --> 05:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck you've turned
 
05:27:51.788 --> 05:27:51.798 align:start position:0%
65 um free is free zero premium sounds
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
pretty good if you're having trouble
 
05:27:56.030 --> 05:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
putting um you know food on the table
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
and forget Joe neth pushing this on you
 
05:28:01.548 --> 05:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
it is really hard to resist free ice I
 
05:28:03.868 --> 05:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
do this to you know I see you wrote 10
 
05:28:06.190 --> 05:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
minutes but some I think would you're
 
05:28:08.510 --> 05:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
been really have we've covered already
 
05:28:12.190 --> 05:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
we we all get these problems okay okay
 
05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
well let me thank you well let's talk
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
about get something real tell us
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
something we haven't heard yet okay well
 
05:28:20.670 --> 05:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
the question was how often do people um
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh disenroll or F so a couple of issues
 
05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
Nationwide 177% of seniors disenroll
 
05:28:30.350 --> 05:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
from Medicare Advantage due to lack of
 
05:28:32.510 --> 05:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
clinician coverage or financial
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
burden but that doesn't account for the
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
many others who wish to disenroll but
 
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
they can't because they don't have a
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
supplement available to them so let me
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
just understand that it's a disadvantage
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
now the disadvantage is that I'm not
 
05:28:48.270 --> 05:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
paying anything but the disadvantage is
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
because the physician they need they
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to go to is not in network and now
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
they're paying out of pocket for out of
 
05:28:57.190 --> 05:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
network care and it's more than that
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative hunt so let me explain
 
05:29:00.670 --> 05:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
why people let's get into that that has
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
not been discussed yet yes that is
 
05:29:04.030 --> 05:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
correct so we have 17% of people
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide disenrolling for Medicare
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
Advantage um why um Medicare Advantage
 
05:29:11.788 --> 05:29:11.798 align:start position:0%
plans have benefits as we've discussed
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are structured to provide
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
incentives and advantages to a lowcost
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
and profitable enrol that's where they
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
make their money it's why they're
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
advertising the gym membership the
 
05:29:25.750 --> 05:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
person's healthy they're 65 they're not
 
05:29:29.110 --> 05:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to have many medical needs so um
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
why not so the so instead of updating
 
05:29:31.440 --> 05:29:32.350 align:start position:0%
why not so the so instead of updating
original

05:29:32.350 --> 05:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
original
 
05:29:35.110 --> 05:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare Congress elected to Foster
 
05:29:37.230 --> 05:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
tax-funded Medicare Advantage contracts
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
with private insurance insurers that
 
05:29:42.190 --> 05:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
enables these very low premium costs and
 
05:29:45.150 --> 05:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
as mentioned incorporates the Medicare
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
Part D drug coverage into the same plan
 
05:29:49.990 --> 05:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's very honorous as a senior to have
 
05:29:53.190 --> 05:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
to select out Medicare Part D and your
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
individual supplemental plans so the
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
promise to Congress was that
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and managed care plans
 
05:30:02.030 --> 05:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
would provide more services at lower
 
05:30:04.990 --> 05:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
cost but as we've discussed services and
 
05:30:07.628 --> 05:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
choice of doctor uh are demonstrably
 
05:30:09.990 --> 05:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
less by the way it's important also to
 
05:30:12.150 --> 05:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
realize as Citizens although we cannot
 
05:30:13.590 --> 05:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
affect Medicare Advantage from where we
 
05:30:16.990 --> 05:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
sit today there overpayments of anywhere
 
05:30:20.948 --> 05:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
between 88 and 140
 
05:30:26.030 --> 05:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
billion dollar per year that is actually
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
um this has been um presented by midpac
 
05:30:31.628 --> 05:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
the congressionally authorized group
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
that analyzes and makes recommendations
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
to Congress 88 to $40 billion per year
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
of overpayments to Medicare Advantage so
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
why do people trying to disen so not
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
only are people trying to disenroll
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
because it's harming people but it's
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
also costing us enormous um loss so
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
three issues prior authorization denial
 
05:30:56.548 --> 05:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
of service outof pocket cost for issues
 
05:30:59.948 --> 05:30:59.958 align:start position:0%
and limited networks or why people leave
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
somebody asked about actually
 
05:31:04.270 --> 05:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs asked about denial
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
of service so there are 3.2 million
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
denials by prior authorization by
 
05:31:12.750 --> 05:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans in
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
2023 unfortunately we're talking about
 
05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
people being Savvy about what's going on
 
05:31:19.948 --> 05:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
in the insurance World well this is
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated only 11.7% of those
 
05:31:27.350 --> 05:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
denials are appealed but if you happen
 
05:31:29.070 --> 05:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
to appeal no that's not right I should
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
be this is a care I should be getting if
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
you do appeal that denial 82% of the
 
05:31:35.190 --> 05:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
appeals are
 
05:31:37.948 --> 05:31:37.958 align:start position:0%
overturned so if 82% of the appeals are
 
05:31:39.788 --> 05:31:39.798 align:start position:0%
overturn it demonstrates that these are
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
initially inappropriate
 
05:31:44.708 --> 05:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
rejections um one in seven denials by
 
05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
the way for for services which are
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
denied by Medicare Advantage are
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
actually legally required by Medicare
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
and this was something from the office
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
of Inspector General that was determined
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
and TW and more importantly I talk with
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
hospital I people who work in the
 
05:32:04.910 --> 05:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
hospital all the time 20% of inpatient
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
care issues this patient needs a
 
05:32:09.070 --> 05:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
particular medication this patient needs
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
an additional stay in the hos in the
 
05:32:13.708 --> 05:32:13.718 align:start position:0%
hospital 20% of inpatient services are
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
denied by Medicare Advantage which is
 
05:32:18.070 --> 05:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
way above any kind of denial rates in
 
05:32:20.350 --> 05:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Commercial Insurance and of
 
05:32:23.230 --> 05:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
those 70% of those are are um appealed
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
on uh are reversed on on
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
appeal we so so those are some
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
statistics on again Medicare Advantage
 
05:32:33.868 --> 05:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
but there's another important issue
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
which is cost and so it's not just
 
05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
Networks cost sharing fees kick in for
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
the person who is ill as um Jen cofy
 
05:32:46.590 --> 05:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's 20% she has a 50% it
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
varies by by plans 20% is typical Co
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
insurance for an inpatient stay a
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
Skilled Nursing Facility stay medical
 
05:32:58.910 --> 05:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
equipment and outpatient chemotherapy
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
that is not the case in traditional
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare and you need co-pays if you are
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
at home getting physical therapy after
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
your stroke you have a you have a co-pay
 
05:33:09.708 --> 05:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
um and it's free and traditional
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare there's and uh again even there
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:33:15.070 --> 05:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
cap of
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
8,850 on expenses and Medicare Advantage
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
but if you have any care out of network
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
and you have an HMO plan you're going to
 
05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
be having astronomical costs above
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
that um anyhow we we I don't need to
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate limited uh clinician networks
 
05:33:32.110 --> 05:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
but I would say that in rural areas this
 
05:33:35.868 --> 05:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
is an important statistic um rural areas
 
05:33:38.670 --> 05:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh 35% of enrolled leaves if you live in
 
05:33:41.190 --> 05:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
the North country are in plans that only
 
05:33:43.150 --> 05:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
cover 30% of the doctors who live in
 
05:33:45.548 --> 05:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
that area forget the folks who live in
 
05:33:47.510 --> 05:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
Boston who want to go to to Mass General
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
if they happen to have an exotic or
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
unusual cancer if you're in a rural area
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
and you're not looking for exotic care
 
05:33:54.070 --> 05:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
you're just not getting the care you
 
05:33:57.270 --> 05:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
need ghost networks was also mentioned
 
05:33:59.708 --> 05:33:59.718 align:start position:0%
so you have a listing of psychiatrists
 
05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors dermatologists
 
05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
but you cannot find them actually when
 
05:34:05.430 --> 05:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
you come to look for them so these are
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
the reasons why people disenroll from
 
05:34:09.070 --> 05:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advent Vantage among many
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
others um as mentioned earlier states do
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
do not have the capacity to alter
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage policies they are
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
congressionally written and administered
 
05:34:19.400 --> 05:34:20.350 align:start position:0%
congressionally written and administered
by

05:34:20.350 --> 05:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:34:24.910 --> 05:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
cmms but we do have as a state uh you're
 
05:34:27.628 --> 05:34:27.638 align:start position:0%
and this committee has the capacity to
 
05:34:31.270 --> 05:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
regulate um um Medicare supplement plans
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
so the or the Omnibus budget
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
reconciliation Act of 1990 determined
 
05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
the plans a through n it has to be
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
within that framework but states can
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
direct what kind of um rating is used
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
whether it be Community rating age
 
05:34:48.990 --> 05:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
attained or whatnot and and I do have a
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
graph in your chart of um the fees
 
05:34:55.230 --> 05:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
Associated so the average monthly
 
05:34:57.990 --> 05:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
premiums associated with various types
 
05:35:00.270 --> 05:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
of different plans I'm sorry when I when
 
05:35:01.548 --> 05:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
and and that might be interesting when
 
05:35:04.270 --> 05:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
we are worried about the costs of
 
05:35:07.230 --> 05:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
premiums going up you will see that it
 
05:35:08.430 --> 05:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
does not
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
L that's the premiums of the
 
05:35:12.590 --> 05:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
supplementals yes supplemental so the
 
05:35:14.510 --> 05:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
problem we're I'm just saying I'm having
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
okay is that I thought the purpose of
 
05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
this bill was the
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
disadvantage plans but now you you often
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
switch into talking about problems for
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
the supplemental plans and and and
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
that's and that is where you guys want
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
Community rating you want to change the
 
05:35:33.310 --> 05:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
rating system sure and so the the fact
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to solve two
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
different problems with this one bill
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
is is frankly a little
 
05:35:43.948 --> 05:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
overwhelming all I can say is I get it I
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
understand that there is no perfect
 
05:35:50.430 --> 05:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
plan okay I get it and that you're oping
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire will step in
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
and try to
 
05:35:57.548 --> 05:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
fix both of them for those folks trapped
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
in Medicare Advantage this doesn't used
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
to be a problem it's a new issue right
 
05:36:03.230 --> 05:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't talk about the supplemental then
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
if you only no no they're trapped in
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
they're trapped in Medicare Advantage
 
05:36:11.990 --> 05:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
because they cannot afford or find a
 
05:36:15.030 --> 05:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental plan so the the whole
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to alter the the
 
05:36:22.590 --> 05:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed issue many so five states
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
offer guaranteed issue remember I
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we will absolutely be
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
looking at what these other states are
 
05:36:31.350 --> 05:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
doing this is going to be a long drawn
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
up I would I have to say right at this
 
05:36:34.590 --> 05:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
moment there is no way we're getting
 
05:36:36.628 --> 05:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
this bill out too quickly this is going
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be retained we're going to have to
 
05:36:39.788 --> 05:36:39.798 align:start position:0%
work on it we're going to have to find
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
out what all these different states are
 
05:36:44.430 --> 05:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
doing and see what's the right way to go
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
but that we absolutely hear you that
 
05:36:49.590 --> 05:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
there there's a disadvantage to both
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
plans regardless of whether advantage or
 
05:36:55.230 --> 05:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
not disadvantage that even the you know
 
05:36:58.990 --> 05:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
the the supplementals is a problem too I
 
05:37:00.868 --> 05:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate I'm sorry to cut you off I
 
05:37:02.350 --> 05:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
got a lot of people out in the hallway
 
05:37:04.510 --> 05:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
you know anxious to get in here thank
 
05:37:07.230 --> 05:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
you all right James you have something
 
05:37:07.240 --> 05:37:08.190 align:start position:0%
you all right James you have something
new

05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
something new offer I hate going so late
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
but uh sure um a couple of things just
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
to mostly I really introduce yourself
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm I am I'm James Fischer I'm a
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
retired primary care doctor living in
 
05:37:23.310 --> 05:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
Dober New Hampshire um I have over 30
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
years experience treating patients in
 
05:37:27.708 --> 05:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
both private clinics uh private clinic
 
05:37:29.430 --> 05:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
setting and the VA system in New
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm testifying in support
 
05:37:33.548 --> 05:37:33.558 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
05:37:37.030 --> 05:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
774 um I wrote a nice wonderful we would
 
05:37:38.750 --> 05:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
love to submitted we'll get I'm not
 
05:37:41.830 --> 05:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to submit it um why not because
 
05:37:43.510 --> 05:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's mostly what you've already heard
 
05:37:45.788 --> 05:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
before okay and and I don't want to
 
05:37:47.990 --> 05:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
waste any more time but I have been
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
sitting here for hours I feel bad about
 
05:37:53.070 --> 05:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
that would like some time I I want to
 
05:37:55.230 --> 05:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
point out just a couple of things
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
that it's sort of been mentioned but
 
05:37:59.430 --> 05:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
sort of Lost in some of the
 
05:38:03.070 --> 05:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
shuffle uh one is that uh under Medicare
 
05:38:05.548 --> 05:38:05.558 align:start position:0%
Advantage Plans by the way I want to try
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
to avoid using the word disadvantage
 
05:38:08.470 --> 05:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
because I think that's where a lot of
 
05:38:10.110 --> 05:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
confusion comes from right in the
 
05:38:12.910 --> 05:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Care Advantage Plans some of the
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
some of the tricks that they've used to
 
05:38:15.948 --> 05:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
increase their profits has been
 
05:38:17.548 --> 05:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
something called upcoding I think you've
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
heard that expression before where a a a
 
05:38:23.788 --> 05:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
certain Pro problem like high blood
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
pressure heart problem whatever uh will
 
05:38:27.628 --> 05:38:27.638 align:start position:0%
be somebody will come in from the
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plan and make it seem
 
05:38:32.548 --> 05:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
like a more uh dire problem than it
 
05:38:34.510 --> 05:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
actually is so that they can get more
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
money from the government but that goes
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the patients record and that makes
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
that puts them in a higher category when
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
they then try to go on to one of these
 
05:38:45.510 --> 05:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
supplemental or metag Gap plans uh so
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of having a
 
05:38:50.788 --> 05:38:50.798 align:start position:0%
community rating is it it wipes out that
 
05:38:54.270 --> 05:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
that uh false or or misleading diagnosis
 
05:38:57.548 --> 05:38:57.558 align:start position:0%
that patients often have uh when they're
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
on a Medicare Advantage plan and then
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
try to go on to traditional Medicare and
 
05:39:05.548 --> 05:39:05.558 align:start position:0%
get the supplemental plans so this bill
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
addresses that this bill does not
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
address Medicare Advantage per se it has
 
05:39:12.190 --> 05:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that it only allows
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
the option of patients to switch over to
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare which has only a
 
05:39:22.190 --> 05:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
one or I'm sorry 2% um administrative
 
05:39:25.788 --> 05:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
fees um the other thing is that under
 
05:39:25.798 --> 05:39:27.310 align:start position:0%
fees um the other thing is that under
Medicare

05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
05:39:30.030 --> 05:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh there's a high rate of
 
05:39:32.750 --> 05:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
we've discussed High rate of uh denials
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
of of Prior authorizations um in 2021
 
05:39:40.468 --> 05:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
one uh the rate of um denials in New
 
05:39:41.750 --> 05:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
05:39:44.708 --> 05:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
19% which was the highest in New England
 
05:39:46.468 --> 05:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
the average in New England at that time
 
05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
was 9% and it's the second highest in
 
05:39:53.708 --> 05:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
the country uh so again these Ken
 
05:39:55.548 --> 05:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned reasons for switching out of
 
05:39:58.830 --> 05:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage you know the the the
 
05:40:02.150 --> 05:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
premiums the the are low or zero uh but
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:14.270 --> 05:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
and and so you know the Medicare
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans are front loaded you get
 
05:40:18.590 --> 05:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
all this advertisement nobody advertises
 
05:40:20.390 --> 05:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
for traditional Medicare nobody
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
advertises for metag Gap plans and so
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's not that's hidden more or less
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
from public View and so people don't get
 
05:40:31.548 --> 05:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
a very fair chance to to choose what's
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
between the two of them uh so uh I think
 
05:40:36.910 --> 05:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
people need to have the advantage or
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
have the the ability to change their
 
05:40:41.628 --> 05:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
minds once they experience Medicare
 
05:40:43.510 --> 05:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage and decide that they don't
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
like it and that may take more than a
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
year to do therefore you need a bill
 
05:40:52.270 --> 05:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
like uh 774 to allow people to make
 
05:40:54.190 --> 05:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
those changes and change their
 
05:40:56.590 --> 05:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
mind um chairman H you didn't hear most
 
05:40:58.430 --> 05:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
of that but does anyone have any
 
05:41:01.868 --> 05:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
questions I'll see the tape okay very
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%

05:41:03.000 --> 05:41:04.830 align:start position:0%

ago uh but I have practiced 50 years
from

05:41:28.590 --> 05:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
1962 to
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
2012 as a cardiologist mostly so let me
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
just give you if you would indulge me I
 
05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
was a first year Cardiology trainee
 
05:41:46.110 --> 05:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
resident after internal medicine in
 
05:41:46.120 --> 05:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
resident after internal medicine in
1966

05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
1966
 
05:41:51.190 --> 05:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
July at University of Missouri
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
Colombia and uh uh President Johnson
 
05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
came in person to deliver the first
 
05:42:04.350 --> 05:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare card to Harry Truman who lived
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
in Independence Missouri 60 miles from
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
my University Hospital on July 4th and I
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
got wind of it and a few of us young
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
residents went to that event held in
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
front of Truman's residence Independence
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
Missouri where now they have a Truman
 
05:42:25.510 --> 05:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
Library so I was there so from that
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
point on Medicare has been a blessing to
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
American seniors and this products and
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
all the stuff that we were talking about
 
05:42:41.948 --> 05:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
we heard all day or afternoon 19 uh
 
05:42:46.230 --> 05:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
2003 uh President Bush introduced that
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislation called Med Medicare
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
modernization act that's what brought in
 
05:42:56.708 --> 05:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage until then Medicare
 
05:43:01.150 --> 05:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
was very simple program A and B and
 
05:43:03.670 --> 05:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman hun you mentioned that and when
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
I turned
 
05:43:08.990 --> 05:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
65 the enrollment period is 6 months
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
prior to your 65th birthday anytime in
 
05:43:14.590 --> 05:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
that period you don't have to enroll all
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
they did was so Security office called
 
05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
me just to show up my face so that they
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
know I exist and had me sign up for
 
05:43:28.590 --> 05:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
Social Security and Medicare and a is
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
part of what you paid for into it okay
 
05:43:33.830 --> 05:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
so part A of Medicare is free free in
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the sense that it's not free because you
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
are paid into it but B Part B which is
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
the doctor's part needs to be a premium
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's optional you don't have to so
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
when when you said oh they made me buy
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
no Medicare A is available to all
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
seniors B is available to all seniors
 
05:43:59.910 --> 05:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
soon as you paid in pay a premium but me
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
and most of us allowed our social
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
security to detect that you know so that
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
corre so that you don't know noce it
 
05:44:09.150 --> 05:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's already
 
05:44:11.670 --> 05:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
deducted you know you notice it it is
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
there you know but you don't pay it
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
monthly okay or you can say it paid
 
05:44:18.548 --> 05:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
quarterly right wait a minute well the
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
re last because when I turned
 
05:44:24.468 --> 05:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
65 the uh and signing and signing up for
 
05:44:26.830 --> 05:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
my my a andb benefit you know getting
 
05:44:30.468 --> 05:44:30.478 align:start position:0%
Med the uh they said don't you want to
 
05:44:32.590 --> 05:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
now get Social Security start claiming
 
05:44:34.390 --> 05:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
Social Security and that way you don't
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to make those payments you'll be
 
05:44:38.468 --> 05:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
that payment will be deducted from your
 
05:44:41.468 --> 05:44:41.478 align:start position:0%
social security check and I go no I want
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
to hold out until I'm what was it 62 and
 
05:44:48.030 --> 05:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
A2 or whatever the 67 and a half so yeah
 
05:44:49.030 --> 05:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm laughing yeah I did
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same thing yeah I I took
 
05:44:55.110 --> 05:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
out Social Security 69 and a half
 
05:44:57.310 --> 05:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
because after that there's no difference
 
05:44:58.868 --> 05:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
so what do you really want to say about
 
05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
why we should pass this uh because C is
 
05:45:05.548 --> 05:45:05.558 align:start position:0%
what uh um medical modernization act
 
05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
introduced that Medicare Advantage
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
incorporate C okay got it that is the
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental yes whereas traditional
 
05:45:18.270 --> 05:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare andb people like me and Ono all
 
05:45:24.670 --> 05:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
have or should have um a Medicap plan
 
05:45:27.628 --> 05:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
and if you have Medigap and Medicare 80
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
and 20 well we just heard that Medigap
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
has a problem too because the premiums
 
05:45:33.628 --> 05:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
keep going up as you get older I know
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm getting to so Medigap
 
05:45:42.030 --> 05:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
plan is not perfect but it is the most
 
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
States the issue is guaranteed as well
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
as Community rated okay at at age of
 
05:45:54.590 --> 05:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
issue yeah when you are 65
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
whereas when you disenroll from Medicare
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage ma back to TM traditional
 
05:46:05.548 --> 05:46:05.558 align:start position:0%
Medicare then they make it hard for you
 
05:46:08.628 --> 05:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
to pick up a supplemental plan that
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental plan when you pick up go
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
going back to Medicare traditional
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare no we got it we got it we
 
05:46:15.990 --> 05:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
understand I know I know but they they
 
05:46:20.110 --> 05:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
make it difficult by two reasons one no
 
05:46:23.868 --> 05:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
guaranteed issue and they they to they
 
05:46:26.830 --> 05:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
did it to my wife uh medical
 
05:46:29.150 --> 05:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
underwriting meaning that they ask you
 
05:46:32.590 --> 05:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
individual questions about your health
 
05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
whereas uh if you have sub U medic Gap
 
05:46:40.030 --> 05:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
plans Community rating means all people
 
05:46:41.948 --> 05:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
living in that Community say I'm from
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
Peterboro so Peterboro area you know
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
they will take average risk pool is
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
larger and you are in that pool and then
 
05:46:54.628 --> 05:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
you pay the rate true and myself I will
 
05:46:56.190 --> 05:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
give you one more figure and then I'll
 
05:47:00.110 --> 05:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
be very brief my own medic uh uh
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
supplemental coverage say from Mutual of
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
Omaha I tried Anthem once I moved to New
 
05:47:09.150 --> 05:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I found it higher and so I
 
05:47:13.708 --> 05:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
went back to where I was about $10 to
 
05:47:19.548 --> 05:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
$15 uh goes up the uh supplemental cost
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
so age related uh increase does occur
 
05:47:26.190 --> 05:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
with supplemental plan but I am still
 
05:47:29.548 --> 05:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
happy with uh traditional Medicare with
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
the supplemental plan so anywhere I can
 
05:47:34.628 --> 05:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
go anywhere in the country as long
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
including Hawaii and so on you
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
know United they are our 50th state yeah
 
05:47:43.548 --> 05:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
United States anywhere in the world um
 
05:47:45.990 --> 05:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
within United States Medicare coverage
 
05:47:50.548 --> 05:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
is there and my data is accessible if I
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
go to La even during fire they can look
 
05:47:58.150 --> 05:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
up my ECG because it comes up whereas a
 
05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage makes it very very
 
05:48:03.510 --> 05:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
difficult for
 
05:48:06.190 --> 05:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
seniors because they're trapped they
 
05:48:07.868 --> 05:48:07.878 align:start position:0%
only trapped in the sense that they
 
05:48:09.910 --> 05:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
cannot get back out into traditional
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
Medicare they can traditional Medicare
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
will always welcome them but traditional
 
05:48:16.590 --> 05:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare will not will not sell them the
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
supplemental insurance at a community
 
05:48:21.708 --> 05:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
rating and guaranteed issue that's the
 
05:48:23.708 --> 05:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
crack and that's what this bill is
 
05:48:28.350 --> 05:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
asking for us to or you guys to help us
 
05:48:30.990 --> 05:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh reverse that problem or help the
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
seniors for that problem not you know
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
regular people 65 and above those who
 
05:48:40.510 --> 05:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
got into Medicare Advantage as you said
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
when they were younger Young Junior um
 
05:48:45.990 --> 05:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
senior healthier takes Medicare
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage sure because however as you
 
05:48:51.910 --> 05:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
probably know
 
05:48:56.670 --> 05:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
2200 dollar per enrol more cost to
 
05:48:59.070 --> 05:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare trust fund so Medicare
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage is uh charging or losing money
 
05:49:05.708 --> 05:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
from the Medicare trust fund but we
 
05:49:09.150 --> 05:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
individually no control over that we're
 
05:49:10.670 --> 05:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're worried about the New Hampshire
 
05:49:12.590 --> 05:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
consumer and I know you newshire New
 
05:49:15.190 --> 05:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the US taxpayer and we the
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
medicate advantages that is way over our
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
our I know realm of but the same applies
 
05:49:23.788 --> 05:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
because the people are no Hamshire
 
05:49:26.110 --> 05:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
people also are seniors so Medicare
 
05:49:26.120 --> 05:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
people also are seniors so Medicare
Advantage

05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.070 --> 05:49:31.080 align:start position:0%

in United
 
05:51:10.708 --> 05:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Network I have made a note
 
05:51:12.670 --> 05:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
and I will follow up that' be great
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
05:51:17.070 --> 05:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from anybody
 
05:51:20.948 --> 05:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you thank you
 
05:51:22.670 --> 05:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
Paula as I always like to do to have you
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:33.468 --> 05:51:33.478 align:start position:0%
word thank you Mr chairman members of
 
05:51:35.230 --> 05:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for an
 
05:51:37.390 --> 05:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and I'll be very
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
quick um I'm here on behalf of ahip
 
05:51:41.868 --> 05:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
which is America's health insurance
 
05:51:43.990 --> 05:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
plans and some of the member plans are
 
05:51:47.390 --> 05:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
here in the hearing room as well I've
 
05:51:50.110 --> 05:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
listened a lot and I have to admit to
 
05:51:54.310 --> 05:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
something I know not a lot about metag
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
Gap Med sub Med Advantage but knowing
 
05:52:02.590 --> 05:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
the bill was coming up I did some
 
05:52:05.110 --> 05:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
research and I thought we have sort of a
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
tiger by the tail here
 
05:52:09.670 --> 05:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
because there
 
05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
are seniors and others that feel that
 
05:52:17.948 --> 05:52:17.958 align:start position:0%
they are uh trapped when they elect a
 
05:52:20.670 --> 05:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
met Advantage plan and later change
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
their mind just because they want to
 
05:52:24.990 --> 05:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
change their mind or because they are
 
05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
having to struggle with a health
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
insurance issue and they would feel more
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
comfortable with Med up or Med Gap that
 
05:52:35.110 --> 05:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't chose the first time around
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
and there is a gap for that person they
 
05:52:40.948 --> 05:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
face the possibility and probability of
 
05:52:40.958 --> 05:52:42.190 align:start position:0%
face the possibility and probability of
medical

05:52:42.190 --> 05:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:52:44.350 --> 05:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
underwriting and I guess in some
 
05:52:46.990 --> 05:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
instances they may be rejected I did not
 
05:52:50.190 --> 05:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of that today so you're
 
05:52:52.670 --> 05:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
sitting there and listening and thinking
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
well what what do we do what can we do
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
well you had a presentation by the
 
05:52:58.868 --> 05:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
insurance department which I think was
 
05:53:01.110 --> 05:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
very helpful and the commissioner
 
05:53:03.430 --> 05:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
brought up one thing that I think has
 
05:53:07.788 --> 05:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
been lacking and that is some
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
way to educate around the issue of what
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're choosing when you first go in to
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
make a
 
05:53:18.430 --> 05:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
choice while I was sitting back there I
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
thought well how many people are going
 
05:53:24.430 --> 05:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
into metag Gap versus Med advantage and
 
05:53:26.590 --> 05:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
what is the enrollment and I quickly
 
05:53:28.750 --> 05:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
came out with some figures that suggest
 
05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
that Nationwide there are more people in
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage plans than they are
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
than there are in metagal
 
05:53:41.190 --> 05:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
plans so we have a matured Market that's
 
05:53:43.948 --> 05:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
been going on for quite a few years with
 
05:53:45.788 --> 05:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
people that have sorted and found their
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
ways to go in different directions we
 
05:53:51.628 --> 05:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
have friction between those two markets
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
we have a federal regulator that does
 
05:53:57.628 --> 05:53:57.638 align:start position:0%
the Medicare Advantage largely we have a
 
05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
state regulator that has more control
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
over the med
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
issue and we have a challenge
 
05:54:08.510 --> 05:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I thought well New Hampshire can't
 
05:54:10.150 --> 05:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
be the first state that's had this
 
05:54:12.468 --> 05:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
challenge presented to them so I'm going
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
to recommend a couple of things to you
 
05:54:17.070 --> 05:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
kais and I think representative lontine
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned it the Kaiser Family
 
05:54:22.230 --> 05:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
Foundation has something online and if
 
05:54:25.070 --> 05:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
you Google around and look for Gap
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
Kaiser Foundation Medicare Advantage
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
you'll find it and it's actually an
 
05:54:33.708 --> 05:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
excellent snapshot of what the national
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
picture is because other states have
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
faced just what you're facing and some
 
05:54:40.510 --> 05:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
have made movements in various
 
05:54:43.390 --> 05:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
directions and the market issues are
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
probably in their minds as well well
 
05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
what if you do if you allow everybody
 
05:54:49.150 --> 05:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
that's not served well and is may be a
 
05:54:51.868 --> 05:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
higher risk to come over to the med Gap
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
Market what are you going to do to the
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
rating over there and so there are lots
 
05:54:58.070 --> 05:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
of questions that come up and I thought
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
well somebody out there must have done
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
um a
 
05:55:02.080 --> 05:55:03.628 align:start position:0%
um a
recent

05:55:03.628 --> 05:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
recent
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
um Actuarial analysis for another
 
05:55:09.868 --> 05:55:09.878 align:start position:0%
legislature that has looked at these
 
05:55:13.230 --> 05:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
issues and I pulled one up and it's
 
05:55:16.590 --> 05:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
Minnesota it's done a mandate review of
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
a proposal
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
before is it Minnesota yes it's
 
05:55:23.510 --> 05:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
Minnesota before their legislature and
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
they have an immense amount of
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
information within that now that doesn't
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
mean that you could take that item and
 
05:55:34.750 --> 05:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
decide that that's going to be truly
 
05:55:36.750 --> 05:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
informative for our Market Market we
 
05:55:38.430 --> 05:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
have a smaller Market I'm sure the
 
05:55:41.110 --> 05:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
insurance department can get you
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
statistics and
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess I'm saying I'm relieved to
 
05:55:47.788 --> 05:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
hear the chairman say there's enough
 
05:55:49.990 --> 05:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
going on here that we need to retain the
 
05:55:52.390 --> 05:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill because I don't know a lot but I
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
know that there are challenges and the
 
05:55:56.190 --> 05:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
question is what would this state like
 
05:55:58.390 --> 05:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
to do about it what can they do about it
 
05:55:59.830 --> 05:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then of course what should they do
 
05:56:03.590 --> 05:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
about it that's where I am perfect thank
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
you having no more cards we close the
 
05:56:06.320 --> 05:56:09.948 align:start position:0%
you having no more cards we close the
public

05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.958 --> 05:56:12.430 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

05:56:12.430 --> 05:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:56:12.440 --> 05:56:14.030 align:start position:0%
hearing
okay

05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:56:19.910 --> 05:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:34.350 --> 05:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.708 --> 05:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
right okay all right right for the
 
05:56:40.110 --> 05:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee members um I'm I'm hoping that
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
we will uh we've gotten rid of the heavy
 
05:56:46.468 --> 05:56:46.478 align:start position:0%
load and um obviously we know how liquor
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
bills are easy for us because we we all
 
05:56:48.680 --> 05:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
bills are easy for us because we we all
know

05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:56:51.990 --> 05:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
liquor we all
 
05:56:55.548 --> 05:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
drink so uh but there's one one more
 
05:56:58.030 --> 05:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
there's one more bill here and it's
 
05:57:00.190 --> 05:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
going to be quick right it's GNA be
 
05:57:03.548 --> 05:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
quick okay everybody wants that yes
 
05:57:06.190 --> 05:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
three cheers luckily for you some of
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
people that want to testify had to leave
 
05:57:13.230 --> 05:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
shape go ahead yeah all right um thank
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
you uh chairman hunt and committee
 
05:57:20.868 --> 05:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record my name is
 
05:57:24.510 --> 05:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
Alicia Greg I represent Nasha award 7 um
 
05:57:26.110 --> 05:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
I am pleased to be before you to
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
introduce uh House Bill 706 which
 
05:57:30.590 --> 05:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
prohibits insurance companies from
 
05:57:33.510 --> 05:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
conducting audits of Provider Services
 
05:57:35.628 --> 05:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
after Services have been delivered but
 
05:57:38.030 --> 05:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
before payment has been made to such a
 
05:57:41.190 --> 05:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
provider several weeks ago I testified
 
05:57:43.230 --> 05:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
before this Committee in support of
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 507 a bill that will improve
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
the credentialing of mental health care
 
05:57:49.468 --> 05:57:49.478 align:start position:0%
providers thereby ensuring Granite
 
05:57:52.350 --> 05:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
Staters receiving these services without
 
05:57:56.230 --> 05:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary delays like House Bill 507
 
05:57:59.230 --> 05:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 706 takes modest steps to
 
05:58:01.230 --> 05:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
improve the delivery of critical Mental
 
05:58:03.430 --> 05:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
Health Services to patients in New
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house bill 706 will improve
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
improve outcomes for patients and mental
 
05:58:10.390 --> 05:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
health care providers by ending needless
 
05:58:13.708 --> 05:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
delays in the billing process caused by
 
05:58:16.750 --> 05:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
prepayment audits prepayment audits
 
05:58:20.350 --> 05:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
often require one that providers um
 
05:58:23.468 --> 05:58:23.478 align:start position:0%
submit full patient records two to do so
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
in paper format and three to specify
 
05:58:29.070 --> 05:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
Avenues within the pray system that are
 
05:58:31.150 --> 05:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
outside the normal course these
 
05:58:33.150 --> 05:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
requirements typically result in
 
05:58:35.750 --> 05:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
providers having to either take um away
 
05:58:38.110 --> 05:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
from clinical work to respond or hire
 
05:58:41.110 --> 05:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
outside resources at additional costs to
 
05:58:43.708 --> 05:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
respond importantly these costs are not
 
05:58:46.590 --> 05:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
paid for by the payer regardless of the
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
results of the
 
05:58:50.510 --> 05:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
review additionally if a provider does
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
not respond in the timeframe required by
 
05:58:55.350 --> 05:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
the by the payer they will simply never
 
05:58:57.150 --> 05:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
be paid for the services already
 
05:58:59.628 --> 05:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
provided to the member these delays
 
05:59:01.788 --> 05:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
threaten the financial viability of many
 
05:59:04.430 --> 05:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
small providers as most of them have no
 
05:59:06.468 --> 05:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
sources of income other other than
 
05:59:08.868 --> 05:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
payment from the insurers this means
 
05:59:11.070 --> 05:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
delays of even a week or two in payment
 
05:59:13.628 --> 05:59:13.638 align:start position:0%
for services already provided can result
 
05:59:15.628 --> 05:59:15.638 align:start position:0%
in missed rent payments unpaid
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
electrical bills and other Financial
 
05:59:20.190 --> 05:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
hardships no one is questioning the
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
right of payers to conduct reasonable
 
05:59:24.590 --> 05:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
due diligence to ensure proper
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
procedures are followed but there must
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
be a balance too often paers insist in
 
05:59:32.910 --> 05:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
on exhaustive time intensive audits that
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
overly burden providers keep them from
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
getting paid paid for their essential
 
05:59:40.390 --> 05:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
work and work and away from providing
 
05:59:43.270 --> 05:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
their important Services House Bill 706
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
seeks to strike that balance providing
 
05:59:47.670 --> 05:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
necessary Financial Security to
 
05:59:50.030 --> 05:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
providers by simply requiring that no
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
insurer May conduct an audit of Provider
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
Services after Services have been
 
05:59:56.750 --> 05:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
delivered but before payment has been
 
05:59:59.670 --> 05:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
made to such a provider as I noted in my
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
testimony a few weeks ago our state's
 
06:00:04.350 --> 06:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges are nonpartisan
 
06:00:06.830 --> 06:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
and demand all of our attention
 
06:00:08.628 --> 06:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
as Governor aat concluded when
 
06:00:10.910 --> 06:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
addressing behavioral health during her
 
06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
inaugural speech seeking care for your
 
06:00:15.468 --> 06:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
mental health is just as important as
 
06:00:17.468 --> 06:00:17.478 align:start position:0%
going to the doctor when you're feeling
 
06:00:19.868 --> 06:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
sick or dealing with a physical injury
 
06:00:21.788 --> 06:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
we all need to work together on this and
 
06:00:24.350 --> 06:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
take care of each other I'm happy to do
 
06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
my best to answer questions um Rebecca
 
06:00:28.590 --> 06:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
sarter from Life stance Health was
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
unable to still be here so I do have her
 
06:00:32.910 --> 06:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
testimony which will save time uh that
 
06:00:36.190 --> 06:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
I'll pass around to you but great thank
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
you thanks so
 
06:00:40.788 --> 06:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
much thank you wonderful this is going
 
06:00:42.670 --> 06:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
to go to a subcommittee so we'll yes
 
06:00:44.430 --> 06:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely we'll do the de few people
 
06:00:45.628 --> 06:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
that will be there that had to leave
 
06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
today that'll be there for that thank
 
06:00:48.990 --> 06:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
you right but just let them know that
 
06:00:50.990 --> 06:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're not taking testimony we'll be it's
 
06:00:53.868 --> 06:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
a conversation you know when we do that
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh Michelle Heaton from okay uh
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
Anthem thank you Mr chair and members of
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
the committee I I will do my best to be
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
brief um and not repeat what Peter
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
already said U so my name is Sabrina
 
06:01:14.390 --> 06:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
Dunlap I'm senior director of government
 
06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
relations for Anthem thank you for the
 
06:01:17.948 --> 06:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak we are opposed to
 
06:01:20.350 --> 06:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
hb76 for a number of reasons we find the
 
06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill extremely problematic um and I
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
would just like to to briefly cover what
 
06:01:27.868 --> 06:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
Peter T touched on that grounding the
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
conversation that auditing is part of
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
payment Integrity so that is about
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
preventing fraud waste and abuse that is
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
about protecting our members that is
 
06:01:38.910 --> 06:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
about protecting employers who are
 
06:01:41.310 --> 06:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
clients of ours um and we have a
 
06:01:42.910 --> 06:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty as Peter mentioned to
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
make sure claims are being properly
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
build by providers
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
um and I will just add ensuring payment
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
Integrity is industry Norm this is
 
06:01:53.310 --> 06:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
something CMS does something state and
 
06:01:55.070 --> 06:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
federal government does because there's
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of waste in our Health Care system
 
06:01:59.788 --> 06:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
so we have a team dedicated to ensuring
 
06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
claims are being build and paid properly
 
06:02:04.110 --> 06:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
they do this for a number of means um it
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
can include data analytics it includes
 
06:02:09.070 --> 06:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
finding patterns that are sort of odd
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the type of provider and if we
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
identify billing patterns outside the
 
06:02:15.270 --> 06:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
norm we might request additional records
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the billing makes
 
06:02:21.150 --> 06:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
sense um and I just want to get into one
 
06:02:22.990 --> 06:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
detail in part of why the bill is so
 
06:02:25.430 --> 06:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
problematic most of what we consider
 
06:02:29.548 --> 06:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
auditing is done after payment so we've
 
06:02:31.590 --> 06:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
made the payment and then we conduct
 
06:02:33.750 --> 06:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
some of this analysis you get into a
 
06:02:35.150 --> 06:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
distinction and it's unclear to me if
 
06:02:36.150 --> 06:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
the bill would cover this this where
 
06:02:38.350 --> 06:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
we're up a level where it's an
 
06:02:41.430 --> 06:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
investigation so that is a very high bar
 
06:02:43.030 --> 06:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh it means we've seen something very
 
06:02:44.910 --> 06:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
irregular and billing and it's very
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
concerning and so that sort of issue of
 
06:02:48.750 --> 06:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's prepayment or post-payment
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
is very important and I just want to
 
06:02:52.670 --> 06:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
note that the prepayment review is
 
06:02:54.270 --> 06:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
extremely important because by the time
 
06:02:56.190 --> 06:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
we get there it means it is an extremely
 
06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
concerning billing pattern um or
 
06:03:00.270 --> 06:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
something else that suggests you know
 
06:03:02.670 --> 06:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
something abnormal not necessarily fraud
 
06:03:05.350 --> 06:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
um but could be so um I also just want
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
to point out out that as far as I know
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
no other state has a bill this
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
restrictive I think Maine passed a bill
 
06:03:13.468 --> 06:03:13.478 align:start position:0%
I talked to one of my colleagues there U
 
06:03:15.310 --> 06:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
not nearly as broad or restrictive as
 
06:03:17.788 --> 06:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
this but um we have not seen something
 
06:03:19.628 --> 06:03:19.638 align:start position:0%
like this in other states and and I just
 
06:03:22.070 --> 06:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
want to say you know we have to be able
 
06:03:23.548 --> 06:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
to use the tools that we have to look
 
06:03:25.670 --> 06:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
into billing patterns to do our part
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
meet Our obligation of preventing fraud
 
06:03:28.830 --> 06:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse and I think this bill
 
06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
fundamentally alters and interferes with
 
06:03:32.868 --> 06:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
that ability so happy to take any
 
06:03:34.110 --> 06:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for the
 
06:03:36.510 --> 06:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
06:03:39.230 --> 06:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
represented miles thank you Mr chairman
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
06:03:45.990 --> 06:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
did you say that you Anthem actually
 
06:03:48.350 --> 06:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
allows for the service and then makes
 
06:03:51.468 --> 06:03:51.478 align:start position:0%
the payment and then they will do the
 
06:03:54.030 --> 06:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
audit that thank you for the question
 
06:03:55.788 --> 06:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
that is part of the bigger picture
 
06:03:57.590 --> 06:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
payment integrity and audit can be done
 
06:03:59.628 --> 06:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
after the payment is made to look at uh
 
06:04:02.030 --> 06:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
but that's what you said that cor does
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
okay so in this bill it's it would be
 
06:04:06.750 --> 06:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
the opposite so you'd be allowed to just
 
06:04:08.590 --> 06:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
the person would have the service but
 
06:04:10.990 --> 06:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
then you would do the audit before the
 
06:04:13.468 --> 06:04:13.478 align:start position:0%
payment so might even change your entire
 
06:04:13.478 --> 06:04:15.350 align:start position:0%
payment so might even change your entire
auditing

06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
auditing
 
06:04:18.628 --> 06:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
process in the negative thank
 
06:04:22.510 --> 06:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm not sure I understood by
 
06:04:25.548 --> 06:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
okay sorry my brain is still pred from
 
06:04:27.670 --> 06:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
your two hour hearing bill says this
 
06:04:30.510 --> 06:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill says you know went terms giving a
 
06:04:34.030 --> 06:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
time rign for the audit and the and the
 
06:04:36.430 --> 06:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
audit can't be before the payment but
 
06:04:38.788 --> 06:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
you were saying that you were saying oh
 
06:04:40.830 --> 06:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
oh we pay and then we do the audit
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
correct but I just wanted to highlight
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
um that the bill gets at what we would
 
06:04:48.750 --> 06:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
consider the investigative phase of
 
06:04:50.350 --> 06:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
audit and and so it's unclear to me you
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't call that an audit you call it
 
06:04:54.190 --> 06:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's an investigation but it's sort of
 
06:04:55.670 --> 06:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
part of the bigger picture okay we have
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
a whole new definition we need to be
 
06:05:01.110 --> 06:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
putting in the bill okay okay any other
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chair um if you do a
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
prepayment audit or
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
investigation um and decide that
 
06:05:14.190 --> 06:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
something improper happened and decide
 
06:05:16.708 --> 06:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
not to pay does that leave the patient
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
liable for the
 
06:05:22.910 --> 06:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question um I I
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
need to think about that I I don't know
 
06:05:30.390 --> 06:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:33.150 --> 06:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
head you'll get back to us so yes I will
 
06:05:34.510 --> 06:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
I will look into
 
06:05:38.350 --> 06:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
forget about that I want to say no but I
 
06:05:42.030 --> 06:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
I do want to make sure I'm giving you
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
the correct information and there's this
 
06:05:45.468 --> 06:05:45.478 align:start position:0%
this issue with in network and out of
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
network and as Peter mentioned when a
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
provider is out of network and we've
 
06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
paid the claim the only way to and it
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
was improperly paid because it was build
 
06:05:56.190 --> 06:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
incorrectly um basically you have to go
 
06:05:58.270 --> 06:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
to litigation to bring that money back
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
and again that money is not the carriers
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
that is the members money that is the
 
06:06:02.040 --> 06:06:03.230 align:start position:0%
that is the members money that is the
employer

06:06:03.230 --> 06:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
employer
 
06:06:06.390 --> 06:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
money right followup
 
06:06:09.390 --> 06:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
question um okay
 
06:06:14.110 --> 06:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
um I um had surgery and I do not have
 
06:06:18.750 --> 06:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare Part B because I kept my um
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
Federal retiree Insurance um
 
06:06:26.430 --> 06:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
and Medicare uh I have Medicare part A
 
06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
of course and Medicare part A and Blue
 
06:06:31.110 --> 06:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
Cross were sending the bill for that
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
surgery back and forth that one would
 
06:06:34.750 --> 06:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
send it the other one would send it to
 
06:06:37.390 --> 06:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
the other both refusing to pay and
 
06:06:40.230 --> 06:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
eventually the hospital decided that I
 
06:06:42.430 --> 06:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
was liable for the bill and they sent me
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
a bill for
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
$37,000 after considerable argument Blue
 
06:06:50.310 --> 06:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
Cross did pay but in that case uh the
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
hospital decided that the patient I was
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
liable for the uh
 
06:06:59.468 --> 06:06:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:03.070 --> 06:07:03.080 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and good afternoon
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is a very
 
06:08:42.708 --> 06:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
simple straightforward bill is brought
 
06:08:45.030 --> 06:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
about because um sometimes they have
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
trivia at the VFW and we can't bring the
 
06:08:50.350 --> 06:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
baby inside because babies aren't
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
allowed and the bartenders afraid
 
06:08:53.468 --> 06:08:53.478 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll lose their liquor
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
license also if there's a special event
 
06:09:00.590 --> 06:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
like um I bought um my son's and my
 
06:09:02.150 --> 06:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
husband's names to go on the wall in
 
06:09:04.750 --> 06:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
front of the VFW it was cold out we were
 
06:09:06.510 --> 06:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for this ceremony so we tried to
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
go inside to wait in the canteen but we
 
06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
had again we had the babies with us so
 
06:09:13.990 --> 06:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
we couldn't go in so this bill would fix
 
06:09:16.830 --> 06:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
that for special occasions it's it's not
 
06:09:18.468 --> 06:09:18.478 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue I already talked to
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
the The Liquor Commission and that's
 
06:09:25.628 --> 06:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:28.868 --> 06:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
not would you be opposed that we change
 
06:09:33.468 --> 06:09:33.478 align:start position:0%
the minor or miners have to be a family
 
06:09:37.310 --> 06:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
member what Bes sign in has to be both
 
06:09:43.868 --> 06:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.030 --> 06:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
so and family has to be a family member
 
06:09:51.070 --> 06:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah you okay with that of course yeah
 
06:09:53.510 --> 06:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay this is the minor miners we don't
 
06:09:56.270 --> 06:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
know who they're bringing in but we
 
06:10:00.590 --> 06:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
family is you know family might be the F
 
06:10:03.990 --> 06:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
so yes represent
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
W okay I don't think that representative
 
06:10:10.468 --> 06:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
n is aware of this but yesterday we
 
06:10:13.788 --> 06:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
talked about um Bill HB
 
06:10:15.910 --> 06:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
276 yeah I just mentioned out in the
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
hallway yeah so so we're going to do the
 
06:10:20.590 --> 06:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
same thing with that bill okay because
 
06:10:20.600 --> 06:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
same thing with that bill okay because
yeah

to fix that now you know I I I had 24
 
06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
hours to think about this is why we
 
06:10:33.510 --> 06:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't do things too quickly in this
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee I had 24 hours and that that
 
06:10:39.030 --> 06:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
that um the best way to handle this is
 
06:10:41.868 --> 06:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
to say family members cuz if you you if
 
06:10:44.230 --> 06:10:44.240 align:start position:0%

committee uh representative Henry gas in
 
06:11:21.948 --> 06:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 29th District I want to speak
 
06:11:24.468 --> 06:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill um and then I'd
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
like to caution you on that Amendment
 
06:11:27.628 --> 06:11:27.638 align:start position:0%
real quick but first in favor of the
 
06:11:29.590 --> 06:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill um I am a lifetime member of the
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
BFW and of the mvet 24 years in the
 
06:11:34.670 --> 06:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
military retired combat veteran and I
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you circumstances where I
 
06:11:39.270 --> 06:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
personally was affected by this uh by
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
this policy not being in place by this
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
law not being in place uh about probably
 
06:11:46.670 --> 06:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
eight months ago I was honored by an
 
06:11:49.230 --> 06:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
organization called quilts of Valor and
 
06:11:52.150 --> 06:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
they presented me my quilt at the
 
06:11:54.430 --> 06:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
conquered VFW that I'm a lifetime member
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
of and you know they were not in town
 
06:11:58.468 --> 06:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
but had they been in town my nieces and
 
06:11:59.990 --> 06:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
nephews would not have been able to go I
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
have friends with kids that would have
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
liked to have been there they were not
 
06:12:04.628 --> 06:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
able to go um because a lot of these
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
places do have a function hall but
 
06:12:08.310 --> 06:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
unless it's something that's significant
 
06:12:10.708 --> 06:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
enough to open up the function hall then
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
that's just a giant expense so anything
 
06:12:14.310 --> 06:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
that happens in what's considered to be
 
06:12:17.310 --> 06:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
the canteen or the bar section has these
 
06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions so the and we're also not
 
06:12:22.430 --> 06:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
talking about you know we're not talking
 
06:12:23.788 --> 06:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
in this instance I don't know about the
 
06:12:24.948 --> 06:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
other bill that was referenced about
 
06:12:26.350 --> 06:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
public bars we're talking about people
 
06:12:28.390 --> 06:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
where you are either a registered member
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
a signed in guest or a trespasser those
 
06:12:33.468 --> 06:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
are pretty much the three options so
 
06:12:34.670 --> 06:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
everybody knows the people that are
 
06:12:37.230 --> 06:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
there through membership and you know
 
06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
06:12:41.310 --> 06:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
Guardians um should have the ability to
 
06:12:43.030 --> 06:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
make that judgment call as to whether or
 
06:12:45.548 --> 06:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
not an event is safe for their family to
 
06:12:48.390 --> 06:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
be at and to participate at will because
 
06:12:50.670 --> 06:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you know our our
 
06:12:52.390 --> 06:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
our job is to defend the rights of the
 
06:12:53.948 --> 06:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
people and that would be a parenting a
 
06:12:55.230 --> 06:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
parenting right
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
decision now with your Amendment the
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
caution that I would give you is that
 
06:13:01.830 --> 06:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances where somebody
 
06:13:04.350 --> 06:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
who is not direct family may be a
 
06:13:04.360 --> 06:13:05.788 align:start position:0%
who is not direct family may be a
guardian

06:13:05.788 --> 06:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
06:13:08.670 --> 06:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
um whether it be adoption system whether
 
06:13:12.510 --> 06:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
it be a uh a dating relationship that is
 
06:13:14.948 --> 06:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
unwed where one has a par a kid that
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
they co-parent so there are
 
06:13:18.230 --> 06:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that may be too
 
06:13:20.468 --> 06:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
narrow now with that said if that's the
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
only way that this would pass I would
 
06:13:23.670 --> 06:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
support it but I would be concerned that
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
that may narrow it down too much to have
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the guardian or parent make healthy
 
06:13:30.350 --> 06:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
decisions for their family um we can
 
06:13:33.430 --> 06:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
certainly work with the enforcement to
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know make sure Guardian the family
 
06:13:38.230 --> 06:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
some family is not the right word but
 
06:13:42.190 --> 06:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we're it it have to be your first
 
06:13:44.830 --> 06:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
example about you know let's say your
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
your children have friends who want to
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
come in no no I I no uh yes go do it in
 
06:13:55.990 --> 06:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
the banquet hall okay make sure they but
 
06:13:58.230 --> 06:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
that in terms of you know that what the
 
06:14:00.110 --> 06:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
idea is family you know or you know
 
06:14:02.750 --> 06:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
Guardian that you know they're uh
 
06:14:04.190 --> 06:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
because we're not saying that you got to
 
06:14:06.910 --> 06:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
show ID because they don't have IDs
 
06:14:08.948 --> 06:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
right they're under age you know so it's
 
06:14:11.750 --> 06:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
not it's not like a thing it's just that
 
06:14:14.948 --> 06:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
um it has to be show showing you know
 
06:14:17.150 --> 06:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure family or Guardian will come up
 
06:14:20.830 --> 06:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
with a good expression to to
 
06:14:24.350 --> 06:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
get nieces and
 
06:14:26.910 --> 06:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
nephews but we'll figure out something
 
06:14:30.270 --> 06:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
like that thank you Mr chair pending any
 
06:14:35.110 --> 06:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you okay chief
 
06:14:39.750 --> 06:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
anything thank you Mr chairman uh I'll
 
06:14:47.590 --> 06:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
be quick uh just because uh for not only
 
06:14:50.868 --> 06:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
time but also uh what has been
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
eloquently spoken in front of all of you
 
06:14:56.190 --> 06:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh first of all for the record uh Chief
 
06:14:58.628 --> 06:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
Mark armaganian director of enforcement
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
licensing for the Liquor Commission uh
 
06:15:04.510 --> 06:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
we believe that the bookmarkers are on
 
06:15:08.030 --> 06:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
this issue and and no reason to restate
 
06:15:11.070 --> 06:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
all the obvious here uh we're neutral on
 
06:15:15.948 --> 06:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
this um and and see this as a positive
 
06:15:15.958 --> 06:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
this um and and see this as a positive
movement

06:15:17.590 --> 06:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
movement
 
06:15:20.510 --> 06:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
forward and are open to
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
any conversations of narrowing this down
 
06:15:26.670 --> 06:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
yes we we can help out with that okay
 
06:15:28.390 --> 06:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
well and and if nothing else I want to
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
be consistent with what we do with the
 
06:15:32.948 --> 06:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
TA I want these two bills to be the same
 
06:15:35.310 --> 06:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely did you you supported it I
 
06:15:36.990 --> 06:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
you said so many we're neutral we're
 
06:15:39.510 --> 06:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
neutral on it but the bookm marking that
 
06:15:41.350 --> 06:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
was that we're maybe not too familiar
 
06:15:44.270 --> 06:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
with that expression there there are
 
06:15:46.350 --> 06:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
safety measures that are attached to
 
06:15:49.468 --> 06:15:49.478 align:start position:0%
this that's all right you'll hear me say
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
that again here shortly right I mean the
 
06:15:54.670 --> 06:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
reality is that the fundamental reason
 
06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
why this is here and why the issue is is
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
because there is no food requirement for
 
06:16:03.708 --> 06:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
the canteen facility which we heard
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday and which as with related to
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
The Tavern Bill and is the tavern
 
06:16:10.390 --> 06:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
license that that that is
 
06:16:14.548 --> 06:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
the the exposure of how and and and how
 
06:16:16.750 --> 06:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
we want to be consistent in what we're
 
06:16:19.548 --> 06:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
saying absolutely Mr chairman okay any
 
06:16:23.548 --> 06:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%

to decipher who's who and how old they

which defines social districts and
 
06:18:12.430 --> 06:18:12.440 align:start position:0%

06:18:15.030 --> 06:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
social districts in your hands I've
 
06:18:17.628 --> 06:18:17.638 align:start position:0%

provided a copy of the checklist that is
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
currently utilized by the state liquor
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency and I've also
 
06:18:29.468 --> 06:18:29.478 align:start position:0%
provided a sample guide of what they do
 
06:18:30.948 --> 06:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
down in the city of Raleigh North
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
Carolina what they call the Sip and
 
06:18:35.948 --> 06:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
stroll uh which kind of explains program
 
06:18:37.990 --> 06:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
in a in a in a broader in a broader
 
06:18:40.548 --> 06:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
perspective um what I do want to say to
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
amplify my written
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
testimony is that this is enabling
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that if a community wants to
 
06:18:48.868 --> 06:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
have a social
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
District they have they will have the
 
06:18:53.110 --> 06:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
ability to implement and likewise if the
 
06:18:54.948 --> 06:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
community doesn't they don't have to
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
implement that um there are several
 
06:19:00.510 --> 06:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
States two states come to mind with with
 
06:19:03.468 --> 06:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
robust social District legislation the
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
state of Michigan the state of North
 
06:19:10.390 --> 06:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
Carolina um have done a very good job I
 
06:19:12.548 --> 06:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
think the state of North Carolina has
 
06:19:15.310 --> 06:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
provided as you take the opportunity to
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
look at the guide um they've provided a
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
really good example of of how it would
 
06:19:22.948 --> 06:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
work in a particular Community House
 
06:19:25.590 --> 06:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 467 mimics that particular
 
06:19:28.230 --> 06:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
legislation used down in North Carolina
 
06:19:31.150 --> 06:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
the legislation provides specific enough
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
guidance for a municipality to implement
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
the social District yet
 
06:19:37.788 --> 06:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
provides uh a level of flexibility with
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
it within it for a local community law
 
06:19:43.230 --> 06:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement in their State Liquor
 
06:19:44.350 --> 06:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
Commission and the State Liquor
 
06:19:46.390 --> 06:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
Commission to be able to address some of
 
06:19:48.310 --> 06:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
the more Salient points that I'm sure is
 
06:19:50.468 --> 06:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
going to cause concern liability
 
06:19:52.670 --> 06:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
District boundaries hours of
 
06:19:56.430 --> 06:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
operation um enforcement um the way that
 
06:19:58.868 --> 06:19:58.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is designed is going to allow
 
06:20:00.270 --> 06:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
those communities that do want the
 
06:20:02.670 --> 06:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
social District to get granular with
 
06:20:04.670 --> 06:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
their appropriate uh jurisdictional part
 
06:20:08.510 --> 06:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
Partners to find and create a um
 
06:20:10.110 --> 06:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
basically a business plan a working
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
model that makes sense for their
 
06:20:14.750 --> 06:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
particular Community uh and then the one
 
06:20:17.708 --> 06:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
last thing that I would point out um is
 
06:20:20.948 --> 06:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
that the what started out as as a
 
06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
response to the pandemic and and a drive
 
06:20:26.590 --> 06:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
to get people to come back out and to to
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
socialize and be able to be able to get
 
06:20:31.750 --> 06:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
a a beer or a glass of wine on the go
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
and be able to to congregate and in
 
06:20:37.628 --> 06:20:37.638 align:start position:0%
public um these social districts have
 
06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
emerged and have become more of a
 
06:20:41.750 --> 06:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
permanent fixture they they are really
 
06:20:43.628 --> 06:20:43.638 align:start position:0%
doing a great job promoting economic
 
06:20:45.510 --> 06:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
development in the in the communities
 
06:20:48.750 --> 06:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
that um these districts exist really in
 
06:20:51.750 --> 06:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
in um expanding the local fabric of that
 
06:20:54.310 --> 06:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
particular Community
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
um the one LA and then lastly um as it
 
06:21:00.750 --> 06:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
relates to the outline this outline uh
 
06:21:03.190 --> 06:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
that was provided to me by um state
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement commission chief
 
06:21:07.990 --> 06:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
fanian who's here today um is is the
 
06:21:10.468 --> 06:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
outline that they've used to create a a
 
06:21:12.270 --> 06:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
similar program at Tuscan Village down
 
06:21:16.708 --> 06:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
in Salem that has been um relatively
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
successful um it it the liquor
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement I and I hope I'm not
 
06:21:23.670 --> 06:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting uh Chief armaganian and
 
06:21:25.910 --> 06:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
the and the uh in the department but
 
06:21:27.390 --> 06:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
that really is that this outline has
 
06:21:30.310 --> 06:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
served as a model as to what uh can be
 
06:21:33.150 --> 06:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
used in in creating social districts in
 
06:21:35.788 --> 06:21:35.798 align:start position:0%
a in a in a given in a given community
 
06:21:38.310 --> 06:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
so that's basically the gist of it in
 
06:21:41.788 --> 06:21:41.798 align:start position:0%
enough shell um I provide like I said I
 
06:21:43.708 --> 06:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
provideed the written testimony and I'd
 
06:21:45.548 --> 06:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions that
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
the committee may have and I thank you
 
06:21:54.030 --> 06:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
Bros thank you for taking my question um
 
06:21:58.310 --> 06:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
first of all it sounds like a really
 
06:22:01.590 --> 06:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
interesting idea um my question is you
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
talked about that there wasn't an
 
06:22:06.110 --> 06:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
increase in in crime and intoxication do
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know if there any increase in in
 
06:22:10.990 --> 06:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
traffic I mean not traffic um car
 
06:22:13.270 --> 06:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
accidents as in these
 
06:22:15.590 --> 06:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
districts I can't speak to that because
 
06:22:18.390 --> 06:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
I I was focing focusing merely on on the
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
concept and and fostering the
 
06:22:23.190 --> 06:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
conversation so that like I said this is
 
06:22:26.030 --> 06:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
a local option um as it relates to some
 
06:22:27.708 --> 06:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
of the you know as I explained like the
 
06:22:30.750 --> 06:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
liability issues you know and those
 
06:22:32.430 --> 06:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
particular enforcement issues that may
 
06:22:35.150 --> 06:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
be out there that I regret that was not
 
06:22:36.910 --> 06:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces of information that I
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
looked at when I was looking at North
 
06:22:41.030 --> 06:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
Carolina and the state of Michigan thank
 
06:22:43.070 --> 06:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
you uh would you
 
06:22:48.070 --> 06:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
believe that um I just uh after learning
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
more about it because I I had it totally
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
wrong what the bill was about but was uh
 
06:22:55.150 --> 06:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about how uh one of one
 
06:22:57.510 --> 06:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
of the first bills that I was led liquor
 
06:23:00.590 --> 06:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
bill I was ever involved in and it was
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Steve Avery of Dublin and
 
06:23:08.590 --> 06:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
the issue was corking the wine bottle
 
06:23:10.150 --> 06:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
that someone would you know order a
 
06:23:13.030 --> 06:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine and instead of feeling
 
06:23:15.868 --> 06:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
compelled to drink it all that they
 
06:23:18.830 --> 06:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
could cork it put it in a bag and then
 
06:23:20.788 --> 06:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
take it home and we had rules set up so
 
06:23:22.110 --> 06:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
they had to be in the back of the car
 
06:23:24.750 --> 06:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
you know Yad y yada but since then you
 
06:23:26.788 --> 06:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
know it's practically every state has
 
06:23:29.590 --> 06:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
now passed that statute but in this case
 
06:23:32.350 --> 06:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
is the same issue in my mind is that
 
06:23:33.510 --> 06:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to go in they're in you're
 
06:23:35.190 --> 06:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
gonna get a pint
 
06:23:36.270 --> 06:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
right you're not going to get a half
 
06:23:37.750 --> 06:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
pint I you're not going to get you know
 
06:23:39.750 --> 06:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
some wimpy size you're going to get a
 
06:23:42.390 --> 06:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
pint and we don't want you to have to
 
06:23:45.390 --> 06:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to drink the whole thing
 
06:23:47.070 --> 06:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
before you can go out and stroll down
 
06:23:48.910 --> 06:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
the street that we would just assume
 
06:23:50.910 --> 06:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
have you take that one
 
06:23:53.590 --> 06:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
drink and not have to
 
06:23:56.390 --> 06:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily you know put it all down so
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
and to answer your question is yes I
 
06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
would believe Mr chairman absolutely
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
would believe that um the one thing now
 
06:24:03.788 --> 06:24:03.798 align:start position:0%
that I'm thinking about a representative
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
bar kind of uh I don't know if it kind
 
06:24:09.510 --> 06:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
of gets to what what you're driving at
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
but the social districts and I want to
 
06:24:13.910 --> 06:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
be very clear about this that that the
 
06:24:15.868 --> 06:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
idea is that you go to a local
 
06:24:18.110 --> 06:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant and you finish a meal and
 
06:24:20.270 --> 06:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
you've got as as the chairman alluded to
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
you've got a half a pint remaining in
 
06:24:24.548 --> 06:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
your your pint and they put it in a to
 
06:24:27.750 --> 06:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
gotainer slap a slaper a sticker on it
 
06:24:29.070 --> 06:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
so that you're able to walk in that
 
06:24:30.868 --> 06:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
district with the with the with the
 
06:24:32.590 --> 06:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
container piece it's it's it's really
 
06:24:35.150 --> 06:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
meant to be you know I mean I know Sip
 
06:24:36.990 --> 06:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
and strolls sounds kind of kind of
 
06:24:39.030 --> 06:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
cliche but that's that that's the intent
 
06:24:41.708 --> 06:24:41.718 align:start position:0%
is for people that that go to an
 
06:24:43.510 --> 06:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
establishment to take it in a to- Go
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
container and then be able to stay in
 
06:24:47.070 --> 06:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
that District they might browse a local
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
shop that's participating in the program
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
they might go to a local Boutique you
 
06:24:53.830 --> 06:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
know they might find uh a bench to sit
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
down and just enjoy the rest of their
 
06:24:56.868 --> 06:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
beverage and and take in the
 
06:24:59.830 --> 06:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
surroundings and you know you know
 
06:25:01.990 --> 06:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
basically enjoy enjoy the day of you
 
06:25:03.750 --> 06:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
know of a particular common area that's
 
06:25:04.708 --> 06:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
within that particular particular
 
06:25:07.150 --> 06:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
District so
 
06:25:10.628 --> 06:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
um you know it's like I said this is
 
06:25:12.150 --> 06:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a local option piece where
 
06:25:14.310 --> 06:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
they're going where if municipalities
 
06:25:15.670 --> 06:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
wants it they're going to work with
 
06:25:16.990 --> 06:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement they're going to
 
06:25:19.350 --> 06:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
work with the Liquor Commission um this
 
06:25:21.670 --> 06:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
is not like somebody and I and I I don't
 
06:25:23.510 --> 06:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
mean this to sound glib and I apologize
 
06:25:25.390 --> 06:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee it's not like people
 
06:25:27.788 --> 06:25:27.798 align:start position:0%
are walking around you know with with
 
06:25:29.548 --> 06:25:29.558 align:start position:0%
with the sixpack of this is somebody
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's actually going in they're
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
spending time having a nice evening and
 
06:25:35.990 --> 06:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
instead of finishing their beverage they
 
06:25:37.310 --> 06:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
take the beverage with them so they can
 
06:25:39.430 --> 06:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
go outside and enjoy the district and
 
06:25:41.230 --> 06:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
and see what that particular area has to
 
06:25:42.750 --> 06:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
offer to me it's it's an economic
 
06:25:46.390 --> 06:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
development piece um you know certainly
 
06:25:47.990 --> 06:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
could be a part of any Community that's
 
06:25:50.070 --> 06:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
looking to revitalize you know a
 
06:25:52.270 --> 06:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
particular District that that may be you
 
06:25:54.110 --> 06:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
know underwhelmed or blighted or know
 
06:25:56.150 --> 06:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to use um certainly
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
can be a catalyst to uh reinvigorating
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know a downtown or a particular
 
06:26:04.030 --> 06:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood uh within a community and I
 
06:26:06.350 --> 06:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
I would leave it at that so thank you
 
06:26:06.360 --> 06:26:11.548 align:start position:0%
I would leave it at that so thank you
further

06:26:11.548 --> 06:26:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
questioning in the store so yes if if
 
06:26:16.868 --> 06:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
you take the opportunity to look at the
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
guide that I provideed you regarding the
 
06:26:19.910 --> 06:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
city of Ry I don't mean to highlight the
 
06:26:22.070 --> 06:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
city of Raley but I just I found their
 
06:26:25.150 --> 06:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
guide very easy to read and it was very
 
06:26:27.350 --> 06:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
very simple and and really got to the
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
essence of how the program works but
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah you'll you could conceivably have a
 
06:26:32.830 --> 06:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
social District you'll have
 
06:26:34.390 --> 06:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
participating vendors you'll have have
 
06:26:35.628 --> 06:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
some businesses that don't want to
 
06:26:37.628 --> 06:26:37.638 align:start position:0%
participate but you know they don't
 
06:26:40.070 --> 06:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
participate person leaves their their th
 
06:26:41.788 --> 06:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
discards their beverage they go inside
 
06:26:44.990 --> 06:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
or a participating retailer they
 
06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
obviously going to allow somebody in
 
06:26:48.510 --> 06:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
with the with the beverage and they can
 
06:26:50.670 --> 06:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
shop while they're enjoying their their
 
06:26:53.628 --> 06:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
beverage better than using Bourbon
 
06:26:55.548 --> 06:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
Street or Las Vegas I I didn't want to
 
06:26:58.070 --> 06:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
go down that that uh that rabbit hole Mr
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:06.670 --> 06:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
so this is a a combo would you believe
 
06:27:08.948 --> 06:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
plus a question okay so would you
 
06:27:10.990 --> 06:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
believe that in Newbury port I think I
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
spoke about this before they have
 
06:27:15.628 --> 06:27:15.638 align:start position:0%
witches night out which is a lot of fun
 
06:27:18.390 --> 06:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it's the same thing Sip and stroll
 
06:27:20.948 --> 06:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
and I just want to understand I think in
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire correct me if I'm wrong
 
06:27:26.468 --> 06:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
you can because like salons do this
 
06:27:29.310 --> 06:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
where you if they don't charge you for
 
06:27:31.230 --> 06:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
an alcoholic drink you could have like
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
one drink so I'm wondering would that be
 
06:27:35.990 --> 06:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
and perhaps representative isn't the
 
06:27:37.230 --> 06:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
right person maybe I should be asking
 
06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
the chief I'll defer to Chief arm but
 
06:27:42.788 --> 06:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
shops do that as we don't want anything
 
06:27:45.628 --> 06:27:45.638 align:start position:0%
given away for free no we want our rooms
 
06:27:48.030 --> 06:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
and meals tax but I mean it's a neat
 
06:27:49.990 --> 06:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing it's a theme and it brings people
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
it it generates you know Revenue it's a
 
06:27:55.350 --> 06:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
pre market thing you know and what I
 
06:27:57.070 --> 06:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
would say you actually have a lot
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
against that and representative Walsh I
 
06:28:02.270 --> 06:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
would believe new Newberry Port um has
 
06:28:04.310 --> 06:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the has the geographic design that would
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
certainly be favorable to a particular
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
social District you know they obviously
 
06:28:10.670 --> 06:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
they have the the Riverfest concert
 
06:28:12.830 --> 06:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
there every summer which is also a huge
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
attraction there so I kind of would
 
06:28:15.590 --> 06:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
Envision something like that happening
 
06:28:17.548 --> 06:28:17.558 align:start position:0%
up here in New Hampshire for some of the
 
06:28:19.310 --> 06:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
communities that you know that are
 
06:28:21.788 --> 06:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
eclectic and like to do certain things
 
06:28:23.788 --> 06:28:23.798 align:start position:0%
that like they do in in Newberry Port
 
06:28:25.030 --> 06:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then the second question nothing
 
06:28:26.310 --> 06:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
would surprise me that if you have a
 
06:28:27.510 --> 06:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
social district and you have a hair
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
salon that that a couple women go out
 
06:28:31.270 --> 06:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
they have a bike to eat let's go get our
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
hair and nails done and they bring their
 
06:28:34.750 --> 06:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
they bring their glass line with them
 
06:28:37.990 --> 06:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
while they have a have a have a spa day
 
06:28:40.708 --> 06:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
that's not fur question now thank you
 
06:28:43.910 --> 06:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
she's giving away free drinks right Sal
 
06:28:46.750 --> 06:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
exactly right it wasn't really I used a
 
06:28:48.990 --> 06:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
salon as an example but in newb Port it
 
06:28:51.868 --> 06:28:51.878 align:start position:0%
stores obviously like you know clothing
 
06:28:53.990 --> 06:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
stores or knickknack stores or whatever
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
would develop and it was kind of their
 
06:28:57.788 --> 06:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
thing they had a certain drink that
 
06:29:00.350 --> 06:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
night that they invented that they
 
06:29:02.788 --> 06:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
created that they gave away that was
 
06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
part of this theme of
 
06:29:06.990 --> 06:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
this has been an ongoing issue many
 
06:29:10.510 --> 06:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
years ago Eddie Edwards and I did go
 
06:29:13.190 --> 06:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
over this idea because we do know there
 
06:29:15.230 --> 06:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
are a lot of bridal shops that have a
 
06:29:16.270 --> 06:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
glass of
 
06:29:19.110 --> 06:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
champagne and yes there are certain
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
facilities that you know we'll want to
 
06:29:25.110 --> 06:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
give you a free drink so I I don't know
 
06:29:27.750 --> 06:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
we're still contemplating our Naval on
 
06:29:30.030 --> 06:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
how we want to address this issue
 
06:29:32.430 --> 06:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
because it means
 
06:29:36.350 --> 06:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
lure and so we're we're right now there
 
06:29:38.990 --> 06:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
is you know the the law the law does say
 
06:29:42.150 --> 06:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
you can't give away alcohol for free but
 
06:29:45.230 --> 06:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
that it is true we are not enforcing any
 
06:29:47.310 --> 06:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
you know at the bridal shops we're we're
 
06:29:49.070 --> 06:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
not raiding it to see if they're giving
 
06:29:52.990 --> 06:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
away champagne or not but represented
 
06:29:55.030 --> 06:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
sesa I'll be quick thank you for the
 
06:29:57.830 --> 06:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so uh what do you
 
06:30:00.510 --> 06:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
believe that I mean the F you describe
 
06:30:02.990 --> 06:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
for one drink you know social strolling
 
06:30:05.670 --> 06:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like fun and good but this can
 
06:30:07.510 --> 06:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
also lead to people I mean nothing
 
06:30:09.390 --> 06:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
restrict them to have multiple drinks
 
06:30:11.230 --> 06:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
going around drinks would you believe
 
06:30:13.190 --> 06:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
that this is going to increase law
 
06:30:16.110 --> 06:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement requirement in the
 
06:30:16.120 --> 06:30:17.910 align:start position:0%
enforcement requirement in the
streets

06:30:17.910 --> 06:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
streets
 
06:30:21.990 --> 06:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
so what I believe not
 
06:30:24.990 --> 06:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
actually I think it I wouldn't I'm going
 
06:30:26.390 --> 06:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
to say respectfully representative and
 
06:30:27.990 --> 06:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I wouldn't
 
06:30:30.310 --> 06:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
believe because I think you know the
 
06:30:32.948 --> 06:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
whole idea of of a social district is
 
06:30:35.150 --> 06:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
just that it's meant to
 
06:30:38.270 --> 06:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
a social Gathering it's it's meant to
 
06:30:40.948 --> 06:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
people that go out that that go shopping
 
06:30:42.910 --> 06:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
or if they go out for bik Te then go
 
06:30:45.868 --> 06:30:45.878 align:start position:0%
shopping having a a a social beverage
 
06:30:48.468 --> 06:30:48.478 align:start position:0%
within the context of a district and and
 
06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
conducting their businesses is really
 
06:30:52.510 --> 06:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
what the what the intent is and quite
 
06:30:54.110 --> 06:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
honestly would represents a little bit
 
06:30:56.628 --> 06:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
of the success that um the states the
 
06:30:58.230 --> 06:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
states of North Carolina and Michigan
 
06:31:00.628 --> 06:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
have had in that particular regard but I
 
06:31:02.910 --> 06:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
think it it it hearkens back to the
 
06:31:04.310 --> 06:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
previous question from from from
 
06:31:06.030 --> 06:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative bars regarding the data
 
06:31:08.510 --> 06:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I think you know absent the data
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to believe that it
 
06:31:16.548 --> 06:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
that this is going to increase
 
06:31:18.990 --> 06:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
um nefariousness for the lack of a
 
06:31:21.990 --> 06:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
better word yeah I I would say that um
 
06:31:24.310 --> 06:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
that was my initial concern with this
 
06:31:26.468 --> 06:31:26.478 align:start position:0%
legislation it's certainly a burden on
 
06:31:29.270 --> 06:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement in the community to
 
06:31:30.788 --> 06:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
allow this to go forward and that's
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
obviously they they'll have a chance
 
06:31:35.310 --> 06:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
weigh in when their Community votes to
 
06:31:37.270 --> 06:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
decide to do it but at the end of the
 
06:31:40.628 --> 06:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
day we have not changed the fundamental
 
06:31:43.190 --> 06:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
structure how we have in our laws and
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that is that when that that drink is
 
06:31:45.760 --> 06:31:46.830 align:start position:0%
that is that when that that drink is
being

06:31:46.830 --> 06:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:31:51.628 --> 06:31:51.638 align:start position:0%
sold the uh the waiter bartender has an
 
06:31:54.030 --> 06:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to ensure that that person is
 
06:31:54.040 --> 06:31:54.948 align:start position:0%
obligation to ensure that that person is
not

06:31:54.948 --> 06:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and not giving it to someone
 
06:32:00.670 --> 06:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
who's under 21 so that that you have we
 
06:32:04.868 --> 06:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten away from our our
 
06:32:07.750 --> 06:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement issues uh in terms of
 
06:32:10.350 --> 06:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
that who is buying it and so yes he
 
06:32:12.830 --> 06:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
might get one you get two but they start
 
06:32:15.030 --> 06:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
doing a little too many and they better
 
06:32:17.468 --> 06:32:17.478 align:start position:0%
hold their liquor really really well
 
06:32:18.830 --> 06:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they're going to get
 
06:32:21.430 --> 06:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
cut off but but they might not buy from
 
06:32:23.548 --> 06:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
Barton they can just bring from home all
 
06:32:25.948 --> 06:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
the all the drinks themselves and they
 
06:32:28.070 --> 06:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
well in case in this case this the drink
 
06:32:29.590 --> 06:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
you're walking around with it has to be
 
06:32:32.310 --> 06:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
these special cups okay there is a
 
06:32:34.030 --> 06:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
special cup they drink them walking
 
06:32:36.628 --> 06:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
around with okay okay thank you yep
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%

pleasure to have Drew Klein visit us and
 
06:32:47.708 --> 06:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
evidently seems like liquor is uh his
 
06:32:49.270 --> 06:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
favorite issue with our with us
 
06:32:55.150 --> 06:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:57.070 --> 06:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman it's
 
06:32:58.430 --> 06:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
funny I don't even really drink very
 
06:33:01.468 --> 06:33:01.478 align:start position:0%
much so it's not it's not even my in my
 
06:33:04.230 --> 06:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
top hundred personal issues um but it's
 
06:33:05.788 --> 06:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
an economic freedom issue as the sponsor
 
06:33:07.190 --> 06:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
said so I'm Drew Klein I'm president of
 
06:33:08.628 --> 06:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public
 
06:33:10.750 --> 06:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
Policy um I I handed in written
 
06:33:12.910 --> 06:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I made copies enough for
 
06:33:13.948 --> 06:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
everyone this time so I'm not going to
 
06:33:15.948 --> 06:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
read it um but I just want to give you a
 
06:33:17.510 --> 06:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
couple personal antidotes to highlight
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony uh so I'm wearing a tie
 
06:33:22.030 --> 06:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
that I bought at the shopping mall in my
 
06:33:23.868 --> 06:33:23.878 align:start position:0%
hometown of Hickory North Carolina about
 
06:33:25.868 --> 06:33:25.878 align:start position:0%
30 some years ago the shopping mall that
 
06:33:28.468 --> 06:33:28.478 align:start position:0%
was supposed to destroy downtown
 
06:33:30.628 --> 06:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
Hickory the last two years I've visited
 
06:33:32.830 --> 06:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
my hometown the mall's actually doing
 
06:33:34.430 --> 06:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
surprisingly well but has empty
 
06:33:37.070 --> 06:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
storefronts every time I've been in it
 
06:33:38.708 --> 06:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
downtown does
 
06:33:40.830 --> 06:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
not I'm not
 
06:33:43.230 --> 06:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
exaggerating my downtown that has a
 
06:33:45.468 --> 06:33:45.478 align:start position:0%
small movie theater uh clothing shops
 
06:33:46.628 --> 06:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
that were supposed to be destroyed and
 
06:33:50.350 --> 06:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
go out of business is thriving the
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
entire downtown area has not a single
 
06:33:56.110 --> 06:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
vacant storefront and that is not an
 
06:33:59.468 --> 06:33:59.478 align:start position:0%
exaggeration um that's not entirely
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
because of social districts there were
 
06:34:05.310 --> 06:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
other um efforts to boost down Town um
 
06:34:06.910 --> 06:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
they built a stage for outdoor
 
06:34:10.070 --> 06:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
performances they completed a walk to
 
06:34:14.150 --> 06:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
downtown but in researching this bill I
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
found out that my hometown adopted a
 
06:34:17.830 --> 06:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
social District two years ago so I
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
called the business development director
 
06:34:21.708 --> 06:34:21.718 align:start position:0%
to ask um hey how did it go what did you
 
06:34:23.708 --> 06:34:23.718 align:start position:0%
guys do he said look we tried to
 
06:34:25.868 --> 06:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
increase foot traffic to downtown by
 
06:34:27.830 --> 06:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
doing things like festivals that were an
 
06:34:30.868 --> 06:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
October Fest right and it worked for the
 
06:34:33.388 --> 06:34:33.398 align:start position:0%
October Fest but the problem was only on
 
06:34:35.628 --> 06:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
that day would it bring people downtown
 
06:34:36.830 --> 06:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it brought people who wanted to
 
06:34:39.270 --> 06:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
drink a lot in one little footprint and
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's all rubbed off and they couldn't go
 
06:34:43.468 --> 06:34:43.478 align:start position:0%
out of that footprint to the other
 
06:34:45.788 --> 06:34:45.798 align:start position:0%
stores so it didn't work to help all the
 
06:34:45.798 --> 06:34:46.788 align:start position:0%
stores so it didn't work to help all the
businesses

06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
06:34:49.350 --> 06:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
downtown it wasn't bringing the kind of
 
06:34:50.948 --> 06:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
Economic Development they wanted so they
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
applied for pre-social district there
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
was a law that allow them to create an
 
06:34:55.868 --> 06:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
Entertainment District but the city
 
06:34:59.468 --> 06:34:59.478 align:start position:0%
itself had to get a permit and be the uh
 
06:35:01.868 --> 06:35:01.878 align:start position:0%
the lensey so like City staff had to get
 
06:35:03.910 --> 06:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted all that stuff um they
 
06:35:06.190 --> 06:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
tried that it actually worked fairly
 
06:35:07.868 --> 06:35:07.878 align:start position:0%
well except the city didn't want to be
 
06:35:09.548 --> 06:35:09.558 align:start position:0%
the lensey that wasn't the point the
 
06:35:11.230 --> 06:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
city didn't want to sell the liquor they
 
06:35:13.030 --> 06:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
wanted the bars and restaurants to get
 
06:35:14.750 --> 06:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
the business so when North Carolina
 
06:35:18.430 --> 06:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
passed this law they put in for it
 
06:35:20.350 --> 06:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
transformative in the last three years
 
06:35:22.030 --> 06:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
they've had this for two years um I just
 
06:35:24.548 --> 06:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
confirmed this this week with the city
 
06:35:26.350 --> 06:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
statistics and I have the contact info
 
06:35:27.708 --> 06:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
in there so you can call and verify if I
 
06:35:30.310 --> 06:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
get the wrong uh their traffic to
 
06:35:31.788 --> 06:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
downtown in the last three years has
 
06:35:35.548 --> 06:35:35.558 align:start position:0%
been up almost 177%
 
06:35:37.110 --> 06:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
you talk about saving small town
 
06:35:39.430 --> 06:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
downtowns even places you know that are
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
city downtowns in New Hampshire this
 
06:35:43.948 --> 06:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff is working I ask
 
06:35:47.590 --> 06:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
specifically look police crime
 
06:35:50.430 --> 06:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
intoxication trash tell me about that he
 
06:35:52.430 --> 06:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
said nah I haven't had a problem I
 
06:35:55.270 --> 06:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
called Raleigh same thing tell me about
 
06:35:58.430 --> 06:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
your trash problem no we we don't have
 
06:35:59.990 --> 06:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
one tell me about the public
 
06:36:02.070 --> 06:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
intoxication they were like no it's not
 
06:36:03.670 --> 06:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem so how is that
 
06:36:05.110 --> 06:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
possible and they both said well the
 
06:36:07.590 --> 06:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
reason is you're attracting a certain
 
06:36:09.070 --> 06:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
type of person that wants to come down
 
06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
and Shop like they're coming just a shop
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're coming to browse and stroll
 
06:36:14.230 --> 06:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's why Raleigh calls it Sip and
 
06:36:15.830 --> 06:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
stroll that's a very Southern kind of
 
06:36:17.350 --> 06:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
thing that's what you're trying to do
 
06:36:19.270 --> 06:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
Savannah Georgia has this in its
 
06:36:20.590 --> 06:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
historic district they actually
 
06:36:22.990 --> 06:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
advertise it there's a direct flight
 
06:36:25.190 --> 06:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
from Manchester to Savannah they
 
06:36:27.548 --> 06:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
advertise their historic district and
 
06:36:29.230 --> 06:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
the public drinking in their historic
 
06:36:31.350 --> 06:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
district to people in Manchester to come
 
06:36:35.270 --> 06:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
to Savannah because we don't have it in
 
06:36:39.270 --> 06:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester they really do that so in my
 
06:36:41.350 --> 06:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
research on it um you'll see some states
 
06:36:43.670 --> 06:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see some cities I haven't found I
 
06:36:44.910 --> 06:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
mean maybe there's a city somewhere
 
06:36:46.750 --> 06:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
where the intoxication has gone up but
 
06:36:48.468 --> 06:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
because you're not going after that
 
06:36:49.990 --> 06:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
crowd because it's highly regulated
 
06:36:51.788 --> 06:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities can set the hours most of
 
06:36:54.070 --> 06:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
them set 10 to 10 and the reason they
 
06:36:56.070 --> 06:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
set 10: in the morning is because they
 
06:36:57.990 --> 06:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
want to have the same hours every day
 
06:37:00.030 --> 06:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
and they want to cover Sunday brunch so
 
06:37:01.350 --> 06:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
people aren't really drinking at 10: on
 
06:37:03.910 --> 06:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
a Tuesday but you need the Sunday brunch
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
so they want the consistent hours you
 
06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
cut it off at 10: it's one plastic cup
 
06:37:09.510 --> 06:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's got a sticker on it that tell or
 
06:37:11.310 --> 06:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
you can put a sticker on the can you
 
06:37:13.070 --> 06:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
know the person got that drink for this
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
one thing you cannot bring in outside
 
06:37:17.430 --> 06:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
drinks doesn't work that way it's been
 
06:37:19.628 --> 06:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
very successful a lot of the little
 
06:37:22.750 --> 06:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
dying small towns that we used to make
 
06:37:25.788 --> 06:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
fun of growing up that surround um the
 
06:37:28.830 --> 06:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
area where I grew up are adopting social
 
06:37:30.788 --> 06:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
districts to save their downtowns um
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
it's working and I think it would be a
 
06:37:35.590 --> 06:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
really good option for small towns in
 
06:37:39.830 --> 06:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:43.548 --> 06:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
questions questions oh yes
 
06:37:47.388 --> 06:37:47.398 align:start position:0%
R thank you chair for giving a yeah sure
 
06:37:50.310 --> 06:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
my question is uh do you have any uh
 
06:37:53.788 --> 06:37:53.798 align:start position:0%
statistics on the crime rate after this
 
06:37:57.190 --> 06:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
kind of event so I did they didn't have
 
06:37:59.868 --> 06:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
statistics um I asked the folks I talked
 
06:38:01.628 --> 06:38:01.638 align:start position:0%
to at those cities if crime had
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
increased and they said no they said
 
06:38:04.830 --> 06:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
they're police departments have actually
 
06:38:06.190 --> 06:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
embrac this and don't have a problem
 
06:38:07.708 --> 06:38:07.718 align:start position:0%
with it now and they said their police
 
06:38:10.830 --> 06:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
were wary people were wary at first um
 
06:38:12.548 --> 06:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
but if you want to call them I included
 
06:38:14.430 --> 06:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
the contact uh names on here if you want
 
06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
to reach out to some folks and ask about
 
06:38:17.628 --> 06:38:17.638 align:start position:0%
the actual data I didn't get numbers
 
06:38:19.230 --> 06:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
they didn't have them they said it just
 
06:38:20.388 --> 06:38:20.398 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a
 
06:38:24.230 --> 06:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
problem yep okay represent sh I'll be
 
06:38:26.990 --> 06:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
quick so how how will you stop a minor
 
06:38:29.548 --> 06:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
to get a drink because he's outside and
 
06:38:31.868 --> 06:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
I can just hand over to a minor well I
 
06:38:33.070 --> 06:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
mean that would be the same case in any
 
06:38:34.868 --> 06:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
restaurant right so in restaurant they
 
06:38:36.830 --> 06:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
check your ID correct but you're not so
 
06:38:37.948 --> 06:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
you're buying the drink in the
 
06:38:39.670 --> 06:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant you're not buying it outside
 
06:38:41.990 --> 06:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
so um the social dist just allows you to
 
06:38:44.548 --> 06:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
walk around with it in an open container
 
06:38:46.910 --> 06:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
just like you would walk around in in
 
06:38:48.910 --> 06:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
the restaurant or anywhere else so the
 
06:38:50.948 --> 06:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
adult buys it gets carded and then you
 
06:38:52.590 --> 06:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
just walk around to the other shops
 
06:38:55.910 --> 06:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
follow up quick yes so an adult friend
 
06:38:57.990 --> 06:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
can just go buy two drinks and walk
 
06:39:00.670 --> 06:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
around and give it only can buy one at a
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
time oh is that is that a provision buy
 
06:39:04.708 --> 06:39:04.718 align:start position:0%
one at a time okay thank
 
06:39:08.590 --> 06:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
you all right okay thank you thank you
 
06:39:08.600 --> 06:39:09.350 align:start position:0%
you all right okay thank you thank you
all

06:39:09.350 --> 06:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:39:11.868 --> 06:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
right anybody
 
06:39:15.270 --> 06:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
else you want Chief you want to we only
 
06:39:17.030 --> 06:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
got 15 minutes we got to be out of here
 
06:39:18.150 --> 06:39:18.160 align:start position:0%

06:39:18.160 --> 06:39:24.070 align:start position:0%
we got one more Bill
[Laughter]

06:39:24.070 --> 06:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:26.990 --> 06:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
left I will uh thank you Mr
 
06:39:30.628 --> 06:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
chairman uh again for the record Mark
 
06:39:32.788 --> 06:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
armaganian uh Chief enforcement
 
06:39:36.708 --> 06:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
licensing for the Liquor Commission um
 
06:39:40.030 --> 06:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
so it's always good to be third in line
 
06:39:43.070 --> 06:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
or last in line when you have thorough
 
06:39:46.548 --> 06:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
people that have uh vetted out uh issues
 
06:39:50.910 --> 06:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
that are before you um we feel that this
 
06:39:55.070 --> 06:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh this model is a very thorough model
 
06:39:59.548 --> 06:39:59.558 align:start position:0%
it has again a phrase I keep using
 
06:40:02.070 --> 06:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
bookmarkers um and those bookmarkers are
 
06:40:04.310 --> 06:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
legal bookmarkers to to make sure number
 
06:40:07.230 --> 06:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
one there's local control there's local
 
06:40:07.240 --> 06:40:08.230 align:start position:0%
one there's local control there's local
op

06:40:08.230 --> 06:40:08.240 align:start position:0%

department to the representatives uh
 
06:40:17.190 --> 06:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
issues um but the the enforcement
 
06:40:19.788 --> 06:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
efforts or compliance efforts if you
 
06:40:24.230 --> 06:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
will as a uh relate to this uh type of
 
06:40:26.948 --> 06:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
service are going to be ex exactly the
 
06:40:30.430 --> 06:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
same as they are right now um they will
 
06:40:32.670 --> 06:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
be the establishment will be responsible
 
06:40:36.030 --> 06:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
for that service of that one drink uh it
 
06:40:37.310 --> 06:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
will be
 
06:40:40.310 --> 06:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
identifiable uh to us in enforcement
 
06:40:43.030 --> 06:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
efforts uh God forbid there's a negative
 
06:40:46.670 --> 06:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
incident that arises uh but like Mr
 
06:40:51.030 --> 06:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
Klein said uh in the uh research that we
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
have done phone couple phone calls that
 
06:40:57.070 --> 06:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
we have made um we haven't seen the
 
06:41:00.030 --> 06:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
negative uh data that that you're
 
06:41:03.548 --> 06:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
thinking about so so with that in mind
 
06:41:05.628 --> 06:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
um I open it up to any questions that
 
06:41:07.868 --> 06:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
you may have on how we do I know all of
 
06:41:09.670 --> 06:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know how we do business every day of
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
the week so uh I'm here to answer
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions now I know you don't you want
 
06:41:20.310 --> 06:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
guard rails not no bookmarkers okay Mr
 
06:41:23.270 --> 06:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:32.110 --> 06:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
me don't okay thank you very much thank
 
06:41:34.510 --> 06:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
you okay with that we will close the
 
06:41:37.110 --> 06:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing and we open up the public
 
06:41:39.670 --> 06:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 496 and here from
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
06:41:56.190 --> 06:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:58.510 --> 06:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
Committee all right thank you Mr chair
 
06:42:00.150 --> 06:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee I I
 
06:42:02.628 --> 06:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate you saving the best for last
 
06:42:05.830 --> 06:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
um the very long drum roll uh leading to
 
06:42:05.840 --> 06:42:09.350 align:start position:0%
um the very long drum roll uh leading to
that

06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:12.830 --> 06:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I I I will briefly mention why why uh
 
06:42:15.150 --> 06:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
this might look familiar to to Chairman
 
06:42:15.160 --> 06:42:17.590 align:start position:0%
this might look familiar to to Chairman
hunt

06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
hunt
 
06:42:21.468 --> 06:42:21.478 align:start position:0%
um uh but let me uh first start off so
 
06:42:22.868 --> 06:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm here to introduce House
 
06:42:25.948 --> 06:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
Bill 496 uh a bill acquiring New
 
06:42:27.350 --> 06:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state liquor stores to
 
06:42:29.910 --> 06:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
distribute information on identifying
 
06:42:32.948 --> 06:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
the signs of alcohol use disorder or AUD
 
06:42:36.910 --> 06:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
as it's called and how to obtain help um
 
06:42:38.788 --> 06:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
before I dive into the bill itself just
 
06:42:41.430 --> 06:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background um the sale
 
06:42:43.310 --> 06:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
and distribution of alcohol in our
 
06:42:46.150 --> 06:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
society is inherently tied to some level
 
06:42:48.788 --> 06:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
of addiction these should not in my
 
06:42:50.628 --> 06:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
opinion be viewed as two separate
 
06:42:53.708 --> 06:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
phenomena but addressed together roughly
 
06:42:57.628 --> 06:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
10 to 11% of the non-child population in
 
06:43:00.868 --> 06:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
the country has AUD within any given
 
06:43:03.750 --> 06:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
year um the New Hampshire
 
06:43:05.350 --> 06:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh sorry the National Institute of
 
06:43:07.510 --> 06:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
Health defines it as a medical condition
 
06:43:09.868 --> 06:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
characterized by an impaired ability to
 
06:43:12.708 --> 06:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
stop or control alcohol use despite
 
06:43:15.150 --> 06:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
adverse social Occupational Health
 
06:43:17.548 --> 06:43:17.558 align:start position:0%
consequences the Niah also says no
 
06:43:19.270 --> 06:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
matter how severe the problem may seem
 
06:43:21.750 --> 06:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment can help people
 
06:43:24.070 --> 06:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
with alcohol use disorder achieve and
 
06:43:24.080 --> 06:43:25.788 align:start position:0%
with alcohol use disorder achieve and
maintain

06:43:25.788 --> 06:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
06:43:28.230 --> 06:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
recovery there are validated screening
 
06:43:31.548 --> 06:43:31.558 align:start position:0%
questions that help PE people identify
 
06:43:33.628 --> 06:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
alcohol use disorder and that factors
 
06:43:37.070 --> 06:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
into the bill um our state has existing
 
06:43:39.708 --> 06:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
crisis lines um for referral and
 
06:43:42.310 --> 06:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
treatment already in place um and
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
efforts are made to promote these
 
06:43:46.788 --> 06:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
broadly in the public um when many of
 
06:43:49.548 --> 06:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
the people that need this information
 
06:43:51.670 --> 06:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
and services the most are literally
 
06:43:55.628 --> 06:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
coming through the doors of State um uh
 
06:43:58.230 --> 06:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
facilities on a regular
 
06:44:01.510 --> 06:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
basis um I'll briefly touch on what the
 
06:44:03.750 --> 06:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
functional idea behind this it it
 
06:44:05.310 --> 06:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
touches on What's called the stages of
 
06:44:07.468 --> 06:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
change people go through it's been
 
06:44:09.948 --> 06:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
validated about six stages between
 
06:44:11.910 --> 06:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
basically before they seek any help and
 
06:44:15.510 --> 06:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
when they actually achieve um achieve uh
 
06:44:18.270 --> 06:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
the termination of use um
 
06:44:20.468 --> 06:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
precontemplation contemplation and
 
06:44:22.430 --> 06:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
preparation are the first three steps
 
06:44:24.910 --> 06:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
and that accounts those first two pre
 
06:44:26.270 --> 06:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
contemplation and
 
06:44:28.788 --> 06:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
contemplation account for 80% of the
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
atrisk population so we are trying to
 
06:44:33.910 --> 06:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
get those people who are in the stage
 
06:44:36.788 --> 06:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
before they take action to actually uh
 
06:44:41.750 --> 06:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
take that next step um so let me dive
 
06:44:45.548 --> 06:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
into the bill itself um oh I forgot to
 
06:44:47.628 --> 06:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
could you send around those papers one
 
06:44:49.350 --> 06:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I I brought a couple of
 
06:44:52.270 --> 06:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
copies of just documents um with some
 
06:44:54.310 --> 06:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
information yeah there's two for each
 
06:44:56.230 --> 06:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
side people can look them over if you
 
06:44:57.788 --> 06:44:57.798 align:start position:0%
want I didn't bring copies for everyone
 
06:45:00.788 --> 06:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
but happy to provide them afterward so
 
06:45:02.948 --> 06:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
the bill compels the state liquor stores
 
06:45:05.910 --> 06:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
to make use of their inherent ongoing
 
06:45:07.830 --> 06:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
contact with much of the population
 
06:45:10.590 --> 06:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's at risk by providing information
 
06:45:13.150 --> 06:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
on two things one identifying the signs
 
06:45:15.910 --> 06:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
of alcohol use and two providing either
 
06:45:19.270 --> 06:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
the 211 or 988 numbers um where they can
 
06:45:20.948 --> 06:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
seek help and that will connect them
 
06:45:22.868 --> 06:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
with existing treatment
 
06:45:24.868 --> 06:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
resources um it says that the
 
06:45:27.030 --> 06:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
information should be posted in the
 
06:45:29.190 --> 06:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
store which which is fine but most
 
06:45:31.750 --> 06:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
importantly and probably most
 
06:45:31.760 --> 06:45:33.750 align:start position:0%
importantly and probably most
consequentially

06:45:33.750 --> 06:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
consequentially
 
06:45:36.628 --> 06:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
um provided with each purchase um so
 
06:45:42.190 --> 06:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
that uh and this came up last last year
 
06:45:45.030 --> 06:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
um the video that I'll speak about a
 
06:45:46.510 --> 06:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
video in a minute when they're in the
 
06:45:47.548 --> 06:45:47.558 align:start position:0%
store they're in there for a short
 
06:45:48.868 --> 06:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
period of time they're in there for a
 
06:45:51.670 --> 06:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
specific purpose um it's a very limited
 
06:45:54.070 --> 06:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
window um in which they're going to
 
06:45:57.230 --> 06:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
absorb any information this allows them
 
06:45:59.230 --> 06:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
to take this information home where it
 
06:46:02.070 --> 06:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
can be absorbed at you know later dates
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
by them or family members um I I want to
 
06:46:08.030 --> 06:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
make a point this is not in my opinion a
 
06:46:10.948 --> 06:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
nanny State bill it in no way seeks to
 
06:46:13.510 --> 06:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
stigmatize the People based on their
 
06:46:15.910 --> 06:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
drinking habits and it no way uh
 
06:46:18.510 --> 06:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
negatively portrays the use of alcohol
 
06:46:21.030 --> 06:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's literally a uh identification and
 
06:46:24.310 --> 06:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
referral to treatment uh
 
06:46:27.750 --> 06:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
initiative the bill when we drafted it
 
06:46:29.868 --> 06:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh I tried to be as open-handed as
 
06:46:32.590 --> 06:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
possible about how this is accomplished
 
06:46:35.030 --> 06:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
um to minimize the cost and
 
06:46:37.868 --> 06:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
burden there are several ways to satisfy
 
06:46:40.910 --> 06:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
the with every purchase um requirement
 
06:46:44.990 --> 06:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill um the most prominent of
 
06:46:46.948 --> 06:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
those which we talked about and I'll
 
06:46:50.070 --> 06:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
mention the last year's bill in a moment
 
06:46:52.990 --> 06:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
um is pre-printing on is printing on the
 
06:46:55.990 --> 06:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
receipts and I I will I will Mr
 
06:46:57.868 --> 06:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
representative pus shake his head I'm
 
06:46:59.150 --> 06:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
actually going to call you out because
 
06:47:02.350 --> 06:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
you last year mentioned one in your your
 
06:47:04.910 --> 06:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
would you believe mentioned that these
 
06:47:06.788 --> 06:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
could be pre-printed on the back of all
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
the receipt paper in the store and
 
06:47:10.548 --> 06:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
completely satisfy that requirement I
 
06:47:13.788 --> 06:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
personally think that's a great idea um
 
06:47:19.388 --> 06:47:19.398 align:start position:0%
but um but again uh I I I defer to The
 
06:47:20.990 --> 06:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission in terms of how they
 
06:47:23.468 --> 06:47:23.478 align:start position:0%
might achieve this they were overwhelmed
 
06:47:25.948 --> 06:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
with the cost yeah the cost so I I
 
06:47:28.788 --> 06:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
should mention that because again um the
 
06:47:31.548 --> 06:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
the uh fiscal note that came out on this
 
06:47:33.230 --> 06:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill only showed up I just noticed it
 
06:47:35.548 --> 06:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
was there today um it only came out two
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
days ago
 
06:47:39.510 --> 06:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why the cost to program
 
06:47:42.070 --> 06:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
the receipts is that much but last year
 
06:47:44.150 --> 06:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
I discussed this they print a lot of
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
receipts they do I know so I discussed
 
06:47:47.910 --> 06:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
this with a more last year and I don't
 
06:47:49.510 --> 06:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the licker commission
 
06:47:54.868 --> 06:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
anyway my dialogue about that um he
 
06:47:56.230 --> 06:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
questioned folks what was the
 
06:47:58.670 --> 06:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
incremental cost so the paper's already
 
06:48:00.310 --> 06:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
being purchased what's the incremental
 
06:48:01.830 --> 06:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
cost in pre-printing on the back the
 
06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
estimate was $40,000 000 um so well
 
06:48:06.350 --> 06:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
below what the fiscal note says but
 
06:48:07.670 --> 06:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
again I don't get to write the fiscal
 
06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
note um I just wanted to put that out
 
06:48:09.520 --> 06:48:12.670 align:start position:0%
note um I just wanted to put that out
there

06:48:12.670 --> 06:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:15.270 --> 06:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
um did did what's it say in the fiscal
 
06:48:18.350 --> 06:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
note now I it's it says that the cost of
 
06:48:21.910 --> 06:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
programming this to be printed on the on
 
06:48:23.910 --> 06:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
the receipts through which would be the
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
front of the receipt correct in excess
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
of 100 and less than
 
06:48:33.750 --> 06:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
$500,000 is what is it just came like I
 
06:48:36.788 --> 06:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
didn't know it was there until
 
06:48:40.590 --> 06:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
today um but any rate uh that research
 
06:48:42.230 --> 06:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
was done last year I think that's a
 
06:48:44.750 --> 06:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
great solution but again not my call I
 
06:48:47.110 --> 06:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
defer to the folks that all I know is I
 
06:48:49.230 --> 06:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
had used to use down on my Sumer home in
 
06:48:51.868 --> 06:48:51.878 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island Stop and Shop used to have
 
06:48:53.468 --> 06:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
on the back they always had all that
 
06:48:57.628 --> 06:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
stuff on it yeah gone okay I mean I
 
06:48:59.190 --> 06:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
evidently it's really expensive to put
 
06:49:01.830 --> 06:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
stuff on the back okay well I don't I
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't want this is the policy review of
 
06:49:05.830 --> 06:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
the of the bill um I know the fiscal
 
06:49:07.510 --> 06:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
people have might have their way with it
 
06:49:09.628 --> 06:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
later on um I just wanted to put it out
 
06:49:11.270 --> 06:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
there that that was a number that we got
 
06:49:14.310 --> 06:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
last year for pre-printing and I totally
 
06:49:16.750 --> 06:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge since you raised it that
 
06:49:18.750 --> 06:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
most people don't look at this on the
 
06:49:20.150 --> 06:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
back of their receipts but we're not
 
06:49:23.350 --> 06:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
talking about one you know stop at CVS
 
06:49:26.190 --> 06:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
to pick up you know toothpaste the folks
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
that this is aimed at are making
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
repeated visits by nature of the problem
 
06:49:32.990 --> 06:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
that they have are making repeated
 
06:49:35.270 --> 06:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
visits to the state liquor stores these
 
06:49:37.350 --> 06:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
will pile up these will be things that
 
06:49:38.948 --> 06:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
will be lying on the back seat of the
 
06:49:40.310 --> 06:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
car these will be things that their
 
06:49:42.350 --> 06:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
friends or their family members might
 
06:49:45.548 --> 06:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
pick up and say hey these couple little
 
06:49:47.868 --> 06:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
questions on here sounds like maybe you
 
06:49:50.230 --> 06:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
do you want to think about taking taking
 
06:49:53.190 --> 06:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
a step toward that it's not an an State
 
06:49:55.628 --> 06:49:55.638 align:start position:0%
it's just offering information but again
 
06:49:57.750 --> 06:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm not here to I'm not here to debate
 
06:49:59.388 --> 06:49:59.398 align:start position:0%
the merits I'm just here to present the
 
06:50:03.548 --> 06:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
bill um so again it natur Al targets the
 
06:50:05.750 --> 06:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
atrisk population these are folks who
 
06:50:07.910 --> 06:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
are coming in repeatedly by nature of
 
06:50:11.388 --> 06:50:11.398 align:start position:0%
the problem they have um and it allows
 
06:50:13.708 --> 06:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
the information rather than to focus on
 
06:50:15.388 --> 06:50:15.398 align:start position:0%
the store to be absorbed over time so
 
06:50:16.750 --> 06:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
let me let me spend a couple of minutes
 
06:50:18.948 --> 06:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
on last the the bill I had had last year
 
06:50:21.990 --> 06:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
you got five minutes oh okay I didn't
 
06:50:23.468 --> 06:50:23.478 align:start position:0%
know I had a time oh yeah you didn't
 
06:50:24.868 --> 06:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
know about the rule that we have to shut
 
06:50:27.388 --> 06:50:27.398 align:start position:0%
the state this building down at 5 o' I
 
06:50:31.708 --> 06:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
did not know that I I I okay well then I
 
06:50:35.468 --> 06:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
won't delay um House Bill 1621 last year
 
06:50:38.510 --> 06:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
very similar bill um it took an
 
06:50:39.868 --> 06:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
interesting we will be going to subc
 
06:50:41.910 --> 06:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
commmittee so what we will be going to
 
06:50:43.948 --> 06:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
subcommitte okay so suffice it to say
 
06:50:46.270 --> 06:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
there was a bill last year um it went to
 
06:50:48.310 --> 06:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
interim study but the Liquor Commission
 
06:50:51.430 --> 06:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
liked the content the commissioner put
 
06:50:54.670 --> 06:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
together a a a grant-funded
 
06:50:57.110 --> 06:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
professionally shot video that is now
 
06:50:59.830 --> 06:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
intended and is running I've seen it uh
 
06:51:01.868 --> 06:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
on all the screens in all the state
 
06:51:05.190 --> 06:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
liquor stores um not on a not not on a
 
06:51:06.830 --> 06:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
continuous basis but it's a 30 second
 
06:51:09.070 --> 06:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
video and it's on a loop in between the
 
06:51:11.110 --> 06:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
advertisements that run on those same
 
06:51:15.590 --> 06:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
screens um so my goal here is basically
 
06:51:18.590 --> 06:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
to reintroduce this bill to solidify
 
06:51:20.868 --> 06:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
that success because it is not anywhere
 
06:51:22.788 --> 06:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
mandated it was a same onetime Grant
 
06:51:26.388 --> 06:51:26.398 align:start position:0%
funded initiative and to deepen this you
 
06:51:28.548 --> 06:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
know I think initial and successful I
 
06:51:30.070 --> 06:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
think hopefully others would agree
 
06:51:31.590 --> 06:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the Liquor
 
06:51:33.590 --> 06:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
Commission and our Public Health
 
06:51:36.948 --> 06:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
Community um and it doesn't compromise
 
06:51:38.910 --> 06:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
the mission of either group it actually
 
06:51:40.990 --> 06:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
enhances I think the mission of both
 
06:51:43.388 --> 06:51:43.398 align:start position:0%
groups um so a quick couple of numbers
 
06:51:44.628 --> 06:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire which is in the
 
06:51:46.948 --> 06:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
information I sent around so we are a
 
06:51:49.110 --> 06:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
control State one of depending on how
 
06:51:51.388 --> 06:51:51.398 align:start position:0%
you count up to up up to 18 but a lot
 
06:51:54.590 --> 06:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
less that do it the way we do it um our
 
06:51:56.788 --> 06:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
rate of alcohol use disorder in New
 
06:51:59.310 --> 06:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most recent numbers for the 18
 
06:51:59.320 --> 06:52:00.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most recent numbers for the 18
plus

06:52:00.270 --> 06:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
plus
 
06:52:04.350 --> 06:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
population um is around 12% it's above
 
06:52:06.430 --> 06:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
the national average it's above the New
 
06:52:08.590 --> 06:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
England average uh Northeast average I
 
06:52:11.310 --> 06:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
should say we're 36 in the country as
 
06:52:15.310 --> 06:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
far as uh alcohol use disorder rates um
 
06:52:17.070 --> 06:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to estimate the human cost
 
06:52:18.990 --> 06:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of lives in terms of families
 
06:52:22.510 --> 06:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of careers and um and in terms
 
06:52:25.590 --> 06:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
of people's Liberty um the cost New
 
06:52:27.948 --> 06:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for for actual dollars however
 
06:52:30.350 --> 06:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
is estimated um it's in the document
 
06:52:33.310 --> 06:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
that I sent around um
 
06:52:34.750 --> 06:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh I won't read the whole title but it's
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
from 2017 that's the most recent we have
 
06:52:39.750 --> 06:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
direct costs for things like police
 
06:52:42.670 --> 06:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
courts jails property damage uh
 
06:52:44.708 --> 06:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
treatment of addiction Health
 
06:52:47.670 --> 06:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
consequences is about $800 million
 
06:52:49.750 --> 06:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's roughly the same as the gross not
 
06:52:52.310 --> 06:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
net proceeds for our state's liquor
 
06:52:55.110 --> 06:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
sales so a small impact would make a
 
06:52:57.628 --> 06:52:57.638 align:start position:0%
huge difference if you include loss
 
06:53:00.310 --> 06:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
productivity in that docu in in that
 
06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
estimate it goes up by an additional
 
06:53:05.510 --> 06:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars to 2.3 billion
 
06:53:09.510 --> 06:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's not born in any way in the cost
 
06:53:11.270 --> 06:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the sales but it's being born at our
 
06:53:13.468 --> 06:53:13.478 align:start position:0%
counties and our towns and our police
 
06:53:16.590 --> 06:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
departments and our health insurance so
 
06:53:18.468 --> 06:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
all I will say is treatment treatment
 
06:53:20.230 --> 06:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
programs work it also estimates that
 
06:53:23.110 --> 06:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's $3 benefit for every $1 of
 
06:53:26.468 --> 06:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
treatment um that's provided so again
 
06:53:28.388 --> 06:53:28.398 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to build on what's happened
 
06:53:30.548 --> 06:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
last year not supplant it not say that
 
06:53:32.070 --> 06:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a good thing it was a really
 
06:53:33.110 --> 06:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
06:53:34.990 --> 06:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
um it imposes minimal
 
06:53:38.270 --> 06:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
costs and if you believe that fiscal
 
06:53:40.548 --> 06:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
note they said there's 10 million
 
06:53:42.270 --> 06:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
transactions that take place in New
 
06:53:45.230 --> 06:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if we can for maybe the
 
06:53:47.590 --> 06:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
cost of $40,000 pre-print this
 
06:53:49.708 --> 06:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
information scientifically proven
 
06:53:51.628 --> 06:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
information on the back of of each
 
06:53:53.628 --> 06:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
receipt if we could make a half a
 
06:53:53.638 --> 06:53:54.948 align:start position:0%
receipt if we could make a half a
percent

06:53:54.948 --> 06:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:53:57.510 --> 06:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
difference we we we would make a huge
 
06:53:58.868 --> 06:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
impact and I think we could do a lot
 
06:54:00.628 --> 06:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
more so thank you I glad to take any
 
06:54:00.638 --> 06:54:02.468 align:start position:0%
more so thank you I glad to take any
questions

06:54:02.468 --> 06:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:54:05.110 --> 06:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure Aiden's ears are
 
06:54:07.750 --> 06:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
burning okay and and I didn't mean to
 
06:54:09.070 --> 06:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
imply anything other than what we
 
06:54:12.548 --> 06:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
discussed in the past thank you very
 
06:54:15.990 --> 06:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
much we're all set we good thank you
 
06:54:19.430 --> 06:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
because Linda's got two minutes or one
 
06:54:21.788 --> 06:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
minute we're all supposed to be leaving
 
06:54:23.990 --> 06:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
the building one
 
06:54:26.430 --> 06:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
minute sorry to hold you up I really
 
06:54:28.548 --> 06:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
thought we could get through today but I
 
06:54:31.230 --> 06:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
was wrong thank you Mr chairman
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
colleagues and Friends friends I am one
 
06:54:36.910 --> 06:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
of those victims of alcoholism I am not
 
06:54:36.920 --> 06:54:38.030 align:start position:0%
of those victims of alcoholism I am not
