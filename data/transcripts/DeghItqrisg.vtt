and down
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
syndrome um I I think this bill has got
 
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:17.789 align:start position:0%
syndrome um I I think this bill has got
some

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
issues um and I I think we should
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
it um can you describe any of the issues
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
yeah well the fact that we heard from
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
that one section needed to be that
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
they're repealing the wrong paragraph
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
not withstanding that we could fix that
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
but the part about how this new therapy
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's being uh used is actually a it's
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
not even accepted by Medicare anyways a
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
and who would you would think would
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
cover it you know no Medicare and
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid both okay I guess young people
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
could be on Medicare they keep Medicare
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
is you know obviously fed Medicaid is
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state's got skin in it um but that
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
what in terms of this the application of
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
this therapy and how this therapy is
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to work okay it is it has not
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
really gone through the full you know uh
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
testing that you normally do in a
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
medical procedure what the process and
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
so in terms of um until we need to know
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
that that these practices are generally
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
accepted that I think it's premature to
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislation you know how widely used it
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
is I I don't I don't mean in terms of no
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that it's how wiely used
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
it I anybody can tell us how widely used
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
this procedure these procedure what it
 
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.750 align:start position:0%
this procedure these procedure what it
was

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
name yeah
 
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.669 align:start position:0%
name yeah
right

00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
right is anybody here to speak for this
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
bill or for that
 
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.590 align:start position:0%
bill or for that
issue

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what I'm just saying that
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
it it might it might come mean I I am
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going have to say being on this
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee and doing mandates all these
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
years the DSM is is I know is the Bible
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
and the DSM in terms of um it's gone as
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
far as finding it but they have not
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's no generally accepted procedures
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
and process and so I just think it's
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%

yes I made a motion so it
 
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
yes I made a motion so it
was

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
353 okay all right next is 399 uh
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
relative insurance coverage for blood
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
Burrows second by
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
pass okay all faor raise your hand 1 two
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right next is
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
556 prohibiting Health carrier firms
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
from establishing payment or
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement provisions solely uh they
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
solely on the participating providers
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
lure so uh obviously this bill is rather
 
00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
benign because there's so many other
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
factors in how they determine how the
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
compensation is but when I kept saying
 
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
compensation is but when I kept saying
to

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.830 align:start position:0%
to
myself

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
solely so you kind of laughed at me when
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
I said it so no
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
no now your your question was leg cuz
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
you're like where where did this come
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
from and what how does this got to do
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
with insurance and that was that was
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
really I was laughing because I had so
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
much history you know when when it comes
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
to the credit bureaus the credit bureau
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
on your for driver's auto insurance um
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
but this
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
week my uh my family practice which is
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
actually owned by the hospital uh called
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
me up and said um well your physician
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
who your was your primary has just left
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh he's going going across the street
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
and starting own private practice and uh
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
so uh you have this appointment for your
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
annual physical and um so we need to you
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
know have another person for you and I
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
said okay so who do you got and and
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
there was two nurse practitioners and uh
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
one of them had I had before so I uh I
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
knew knew
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
Bama without identifying the sex um and
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
then uh that the other one was also a
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner and I said so you
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't have any MDS or dos or anything
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
and they go well no we
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
don't and so then I I was thinking about
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and I
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
says obviously it's just the solely is
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
just you know just solely but the two
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
problems I have one is a precedent that
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
if we did this how many other practices
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
are going to come in and say we are just
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
like them
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know and and we have to go through
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
this every time A and B is this a
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
disincentive for the hospital of the
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
family the medicine to actually go find
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
a doctor if they can get a nurse
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
practitioner rather than a doctor that
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
was my concern represent Burrows um to
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
the last point I would say that it's
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
just a reality particularly in um our
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the northern part of State
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
we we can't find doctors so when we
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
don't have doctors we rely on nurse
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
practitioners and you know and I
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
understand that you might want a um a
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
physician rather than a nurse
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
practitioner but they are qualified to
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
do a physical you know it's obviously
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's your choice if you don't choose to
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
do that but I think a lot of hospitals
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
and practices would struggle um if we
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
limited it to to doctors so I think they
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
should be compensated the same well I
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
think we're not we're not necessarily
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
limiting it we're basically
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
raising the compensation to the uh yeah
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
the family we're raising that
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
compensation and but in terms of would
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be raising the composition
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
of doctors so that they well but that's
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
so so we can get more do so we can get a
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
doctor that's a different issue I think
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
right now this is this helps us and
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
helps hospitals and practices be fully
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
staffed to get people yeah right because
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that that there is there
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
no doctor who wants to work in New
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no but I can tell you all the
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
vacancies we have up at Memorial
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital that lie vacant for forever
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
because they can't find people right so
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
be choice between a nurse practitioner
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
and not seeing anybody I'm going to go
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
to the nurse practitioner right right no
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
you know if I have a heart attack or I'm
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
going to go to the emergency room or if
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
I have something serious that's another
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
story I hear you for a
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
physical they're perfectly qualified
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
right but but we are saying you know
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
that that we we we're not we're not
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're basically dissing doctors by
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
passing this bill because we're saying
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
the doctor's degree doesn't
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
matter it's not because it says you
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
you're not using it solely no I the
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
hospital still has the right or the
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
practice still has the right being equal
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's right if everything else is being
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
equal right so I hear you I just it's
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
just a little a little touchy but uh
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
other people have any feelings on this
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
subject representative prelli well I do
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
believe it it pull the mic close yeah I
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
do believe that it does open the door
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
for other Specialties to make the same
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
case so between optomologist and
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
optometrists or you could name you could
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
start naming all the different
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
professions I totally respect the hard
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
work of the arpn totally respect that
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
work but there is a difference in their
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
training and I think that needs to be
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
recognized it's a good example
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
optim I mean I'm not saying that they
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
equal but you could certainly start to
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
make the case you can make the case with
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
social workers and the you know we have
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
a mental health crisis so you can start
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
saying wait a minute we want everybody
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
to be paid the same rate and that is in
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
my opinion a disincentive for people to
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
go on to you know specialty or higher
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
education or um put in the time and the
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
work and the money required to get uh
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
addition different credentials but I I
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
totally respect the the hard work of
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
these uh professionals and how they
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
provide a service in areas that really
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
need that type of um type of
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
professional representative M let the
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee first it it didn't seem like
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
this bill does a whole lot to me it
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
seemed like the contracts would just be
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated somewhat differently and
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
potentially like if it if if a given
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
payer or institution negotiates on level
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
of lure now and we say well you can't do
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
it just because of the letters after
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
your name maybe they'll start setting a
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
minimum level of
 
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.789 align:start position:0%
minimum level of
experience

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
or you know number of patients
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
throughput or just some other means and
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
then we all have to step in and say well
 
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.190 align:start position:0%
then we all have to step in and say well
you

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
can't pay solely based on how many years
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
you've been practicing or what's next so
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
not sure it'll have much effect I don't
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
have a strong position one way or the
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
other on it because of that because I'm
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
not sure it'll make much of a difference
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
my one concern is could it bring down
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
the level of physician salaries and
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually make that very obvious problem
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
of phys shortage worse and I don't know
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
the answer but what do you what do you
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
think I I I don't think that's the case
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
I mean the market is the market rate
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
doctors when they're looking for a job
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're not only looking at the hospital
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the state they know
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
what they know what the what they're
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paid based on what other
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
Physicians are are paid so I don't not
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
believe that and um you know for the
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
people who testified that 15% did did
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
make a difference so um and you know
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
again you can choose not to go to an NP
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
if you're not a nurse practitioner if
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
you're not comfortable with it I go to a
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
physic I mean I go to a physician in
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
Maine um just cuz she does a really
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive exam but you know that's
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
again it's my choice
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
do you think we should include the other
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
mid levels
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
Pas I I no we don't want to expand this
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
anymore no I don't think we should
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
expand it yeah we don't yeah we're
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
talking about whether we want to do it
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
at all you nurse practitioners are
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
really well trained and you know they're
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
not going to do brain surgery they're
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
not going to you know remove your
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
appendix you know they're they're
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
trained to do certain things and they do
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
it as well as
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
doctors but why why not include PE I
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
mean there's plenty of orthosurgical and
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
cardiothoracic Pas plenty of them in
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
fact every cardiothoracic Suite in
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
orthosurgical Suite has a PA in it then
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
let's do another bill on that down the
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
road I mean I think we got to give them
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
parody if we're going to do it I that
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
would scares
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
me that again that now you're
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
reinforcing why I'm I'm a little worried
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
about passing this bill okay because
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to the Pas are going to
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
come in and say look you passed it for
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
them why proba that's not a reason not
 
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.079 align:start position:0%
to pass this I mean you know per worried
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
about worrying about the campell's nose
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
Under the Tent how often have I heard
 
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.950 align:start position:0%
Under the Tent how often have I heard
that

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
expression okay representative rapor um
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
I mean as I understand it it's
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for services that The NPS
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
are providing that are essentially the
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
same services that a doctor is providing
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
so what the bill is saying is they
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
should be reimbursed at the same rate
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I think a point was made a minute
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
ago that NPS can't do all of the things
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
that doctors do or surgeons do it's just
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
the services that they provide that are
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
essentially equivalent to what a doctor
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
does and you know in the case of
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
underserved areas like the North country
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
and you know rural parts of the the
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
country it's really difficult uh there's
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
such a shortage of MDS and if nurse
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners are providing the same
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
quality of service and the same Services
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
it seems reasonable I don't think that
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
means and p s are compensated the same
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
in general as doctors just for the
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
equivalent representative pelli but this
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
is part of a uh contract negotiation
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
correct so I'm not sure why you know the
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
um providers can't work with their
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
representatives to have a better cont
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
this is a a individual contract correct
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
right so I'm not sure why actually this
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
is well this is a contract between to
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
whoever The Physician Office right and
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
the and the insurance company okay so
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
why aren't they having the conversation
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
to say this is what I want to do and I
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
think Anthem already recognizes that and
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why they're okay with
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
this this bill correct so I mean the
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
other insurance company should follow
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
suit without legislation well no they're
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
saying is that okay that the the request
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
for this legate obviously came in and
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
and they're saying okay here's what we
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
can live on and that and and when I
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
heard the list if I this correctly that
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh degrees are a level so that as much
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
as we all agree that MDS have more
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
degrees and have more experience than a
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner uh I guess what this
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
might come into is that uh the nurse
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner has been around long enough
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
to make up for the difference where that
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
doctor had uh his his uh what do they
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
call it with three the The Residency so
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
would that be included is saying that
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's making it equal so in
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
other words what we're we're saying that
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
the only way that that nurse
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner is going to get the same as
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
a doctor is that that nurse
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
practitioner's been around a while right
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
but and it's highly
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
subjective I think well yeah it's it's
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
has all those subjective category that
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's where the solely comes in so I I
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
guess you just convinced me maybe that
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
this is okay and this is this is this is
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
harmless now because I guess it's true
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
there have a nurse practitioner has been
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
around a long time and and has all the
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
other credentials that an MD might have
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
they may better they well I think
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
there's another aspect you you were
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
talking about a doctor's office
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
negotiating with the insurance company
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
but a number of the nurse practitioners
 
00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:50.990 align:start position:0%
but a number of the nurse practitioners
practice

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
independently and uh they can't they
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
don't have anybody that would speak for
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
them to get the
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
solely uh you know the part of the
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation and so I think that they
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to if they have a
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
decent practice and they but it has to
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
be limited of course to doing the things
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
that they do that are the equivalent of
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
what the doctor does I mean certainly
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
not brain surgery or anything like that
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
and I don't think they would try to do
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
something like that right so I think it
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
it would be okay okay so how me are we
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
talking about just um primary care or
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
are we talking about other things the
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners are technically
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
qualified for the way the bill is
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
currently drafted is just mentions lure
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
so it is not specific to aprns it would
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
be specific to any kind of lure we we
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
have that amendment to okay so if
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that's just for
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
aprns then it be just aprns but we're
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
not talking about Services aprns have a
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
very broad scope of practice as long as
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're practicing within their scope
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
then that that's what their
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement would be based off of and
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to say because I think you
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
guys are all bringing up great points
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes into negotiation
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
everyone that has a contract with an
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
insurer whether it's part a practice
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
that has a contract or an individual
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
they're negotiating those rates and you
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
have a fee schedule so that fee schedule
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
I guess is what you're talking about
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
with services that that's what they've
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
agreed they'll be reimbursed for but
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's other methods of reimbursement
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily A Fe schedule
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
so um I would just stay away from
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
thinking of this as Services because
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's the contract that this legislation
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
is talking about that they can't just
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
because they're an APRN have that 15%
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
lower and not all carriers do that
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
either anyways yes
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay um I mean I since we're we are
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
going to amend it to have the amendment
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
that is just nurse just the a uh nurse
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
practitioners um
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess the scheme of things that
 
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.710 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess the scheme of things that
it's

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh would sure be nice to get some
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
more positions in my family my my
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
practice but it's it's it's in this case
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's the negotiating is now is actually
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
the hospital who owns the practice and
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
then the hospital and then in the scheme
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
of all the things they're negotiating
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
with the insurance and now we're
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
negotiating the primary care phys but
 
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.030 align:start position:0%
negotiating the primary care phys but
yeah

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.069 align:start position:0%
yeah
represent

00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
WS thank you Mr chairman since I'm not
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
on the insurance committee I just want
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
to understand it for when it gets to
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
executing it does this mean that
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
contractually uh the a NPS would get
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
paid the same as a doctor if all things
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
were being equal okay so in other words
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
when the cont tracks are are drawn up
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
and what they're how they value that
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
person is that they really do they're
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
specifically to that one person are they
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
really to a person when they when when
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
it comes to again I'm contracts are
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
negotiated differently so I think the
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
the thought behind this bill was to the
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
extent that there is an APRN practice
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
that is just aprns and there is no
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
doctor they cannot be
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
compensated less than if there was a
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
doctor in the practice but that's hard
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
to determine because again you're
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
looking at a number of different factors
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
so if this AP in practice if there was
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
other factors that would justify
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
compensating them less then that would
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
be the basis for adjusting the
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
compensation likewise if it's a rural
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
practice and there's no one else in the
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and they're the only shop
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
in town that would may be justification
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
for reimbursing them higher than doctors
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
it there's just a lot of different
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
factors and the way the contracts
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
Contracting it's done it can be with an
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
individual provider if there's still
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
practitioner it can be with a practice
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
it can be if it's a hospital owned
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
practice it could be part of a hospital
 
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
contract there's just a lot of lot of
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
different pieces to
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
this but in theory that's how it would
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
work it's everything is equal and
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
there's it it's just the only difference
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
is one's an APN and one's the doctor it
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
would require them to be compensated at
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
level representative burrow I don't know
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
if you know this but I I mean I'm I'm
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
asking a question doctors in hospitals
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
because I live with one I mean it's very
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
clear what their what their parameters
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
are in terms of what they can and cannot
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
do particularly with Specialties and
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
doctors frequently get in trouble for
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
doing things that they're not authorized
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
to do so wouldn't it be the same for a
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner they are given
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
parameters to things that they they are
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
they are um licensed to do and other
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
things they have to call on a
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
doctor they have a very broad scope of
 
00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
practice so if a hospital were to put in
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
parameters about what an employee can do
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
that would be different but under law I
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not I'm notc but they have a
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
very broad scope of I think a hospital
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
can do that CU they determine you know
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
like U um we are in my hospital he's
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
gone so I can say we had a um who's a
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
bone guy what do they do orthopedic
 
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.670 align:start position:0%
bone guy what do they do orthopedic
orthoped

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
orthoped
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
who did a um who did a heart procedure
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
and they canned him because what the
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
heck so you know hospitals do determine
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
what can and can't be done depending on
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
what your training is yeah so that would
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
be part in the scope of your employment
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a law saying you
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that or um an insurer I mean
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
it that gets more complex because if you
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
are hired and there's specific
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
parameters based on your employment
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
about what your scope is going to be
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
with in that set then the con then the
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
carrier can use that as a basis for
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
contract and say you know based on your
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
scope of employment you're going to do
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
and usually it's a list of services and
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
those are the types of services you're
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
going to build for and this is what
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
we're planning on reimbursing you for
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
and it's part of the negotiation but
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
there are so many different employment
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
settings and um different cave it's hard
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
to be General about should the bill be
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
tightened up to specify that it's for
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
comparable procedures that equal pay for
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
equal work well that's what is what
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
makes it too complicated to because you
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
know you may think a physical here is
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
the exact same as a physical up in Coos
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
but you know there's different practice
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
settings there's different LIC there's a
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
difference between MD and a do the do is
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing more a longer so it
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
depends on those things you can't just
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
say every physical is the same and
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's why negotiate rates for
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
everything yeah I mean my my physician
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
in Maine for example um she spends like
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
over an hour with me ton of tests she's
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
probably a do no she's not she's an MD
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
she's an MD she chose to do this kind of
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
practice and um I don't want to use my
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
doctor's name but doctors uh in my
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
hospital do physicals that take they
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
literally have a clipboard and ask
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
questions and you're done 10 minutes
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
so they get paid the same as you know my
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
doctor would in main yes there's CPT
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
codes for the different procedures and
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
those would be the service codes but
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of setting you're
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
in the geographic area you're in all of
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
those things can justify different
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
compensation so I think trying to tie it
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
to specific Services as a whole level of
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
complexity that would be very difficult
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
for us to enforce from the insurance
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
department perspective are you kind of
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
where this Bill had started and we tried
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
to get them away from services and say
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
um this was kind of the compromised
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
language that everyone came up with is
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
basing it just you can't have a
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
different conversation based solely on
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
your licensure are you are you neutral
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
on the bill or yes we're neutral but
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is something that we could actually
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
try to enforce if we add in that level
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
of services there' just be no way for us
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
to to but what do you really feel about
 
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.589 align:start position:0%
to to but what do you really feel about
the

00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh representative Herbert you
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
have a question I'm just trying to um my
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of the testimony I heard
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
was basically it sold applied 85% of
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
whatever 100% is for the MD pretty
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
simple I mean if if for the r pins right
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
so does the does are you saying the
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't actually do that so
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
that 85% is what is allowed under
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare and that's kind of where this
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
came up with but every rate is
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated differently every time you're
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
enter into a contract there's a whole
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
negotiation process so just because
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to go down that 80 to
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
that 85% doesn't mean it's actually
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
happening because there's a lot of other
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
factors that will go into contract
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations so it would be up to the
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
person negotiating the contract to you
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
know say why they should get more than
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
that and that's where the negotiation
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
happens with the carrier so would you
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
say I'm sorry I just on a clarification
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
just quickly so it's already solely not
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
license there's a a huge array of
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
factors that go into contract
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
negotiation and lure level is one of the
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
factors that they determine yes so the
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
bill isn't as hard and fast as I thought
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
I was hearing so in other words if if if
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
you're a arpen and you have a
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
MD and uh um he's he's 100% whatever he
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
gets that's considered 100% the
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that I I interpret is that
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
this rpen that does similar uh work gets
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
85% of 100 now I don't know if if that's
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
going up or down but it but it says 85
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
and there's 100 so I don't understand
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
all the other variations that the bill
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh does
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
not discuss currently what Medicare
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
allows is that the 100% goes to phys but
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
under Medicare there is a set rate
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
schedule so every physician is going to
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
get what that rate schedule is based on
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's some parameters for um
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
inflation and Geographic areas but there
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
is a rate schedule and then the APRN
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
would get 85% of that rate schedule
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
that's a Medicare that's Medicare but if
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
there's in Commercial Insurance there is
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
no rate schedule so it comes down to
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
contractually negotiated rates and
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
that's for the carrier and the provider
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
to negotiate so under Medicare rules
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to base to use the um
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
APRN lure as one of the factors to
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
consider a negotiation and what this
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
would bill would do would say that that
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be the only basis for you varying
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
that reimbursement but there's still all
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the other factors that they can
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
consider in coming up with what they
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
feel is um appropriate reimbursement
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
rates okay I just that was my
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill I thought it
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
was pretty cut and dried it's not quite
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
cut and dried that thank you but what is
 
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
cut and dried we're having a systemic
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
financial crisis in
 
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.829 align:start position:0%
financial crisis in
hospitals

00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
systemic and anything that I think
 
00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:45.710 align:start position:0%
systemic and anything that I think
would

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
um cause costs to go down is probably uh
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to be required so I'm all all for
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
85 but but I'm not for uh all this you
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
sound like there's a lot of other
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
negotiations going on it's very
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
complicated contractual negotiations so
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy is not complicated once you
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
go bankrupt and a major provider in Mass
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
just went
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
bankrupt but that but this bill has
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with Medicaid Medicare
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's right is that correct so with this
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
bill going back full CL will this bill
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
what will this materially change there's
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
still a contract
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
negotiation this would make would make
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
sure that the credentialing Rises up in
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
the criteria but there's all this other
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
criteria that still could be used so it
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean automatically
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
that there will be pay
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
parity no so I'm not really quite sure
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
what this how how materially this is
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
going to change so if an insurance
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
company realizes in northern part of New
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I really need to find
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
additional providers I better pay them
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
they would have that flexibility with or
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
without this bill correct yes but could
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
this bill have unintended
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
consequences I mean I think you guys
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
have talked about some a lot of the
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequences
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
financially speaking I think you know
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
where we have shortages in providers
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
carriers need to make sure they have
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
providers A aailable and that's probably
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
one of the largest driving factors right
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
now in contract negotiations down the
 
00:51:34.349 --> 00:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
road maybe it might not be so the
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company would say I I need to
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
adjust my rates if I want to have a
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
thriving practice yes we have a running
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
debate whether Network adequacy which is
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
what that is whether how well insurance
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
carrier you know we've had problems in
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
the North country as a matter of fact I
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
think at one point I remember Harvard
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
was having a problem in the North
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
Country yeah I mean from the New
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
perspective we don't see that there is
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge impact on premiums
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
there may be one-offs here and there
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
where contracts may need to be adjusted
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
slightly but we don't anticipate that
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
being um a huge amount of contracts so
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
we will we estimated that it would be a
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
very minor if any fiscal impact but that
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
actually the the question about Medicare
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid did do they distinguish between
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
a nurse practitioner and yes okay they
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
allow the distinction they allow the
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
and there's set rights there too you
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
Susan so Medicaid oh so this say the
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is 100 so but just Medicare
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare is all right so I I guess I'm
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
at this point where where I'm at I I
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
think I'm okay with passing this bill on
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
the rationale that we need to do
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
everything we can to make sure that our
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
primary uh Physicians offices have
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
employees and have people and that this
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of this bill is for
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
nothing else is that we are addressing
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
the problem people have of that they are
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
not that they can't get a primary care
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
physician that there are so that that
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're seem to be so limited
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
out there and so the rationale in my
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
mind now is we're doing this so that
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully there we can get more and uh
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
for all the nurses I've talked to um
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's always amazing how many and I i'
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
ask him say why haven't you why haven't
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
you gone to that nurse practitioner and
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
and uh um they that this it's evidently
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
as much as we would think this is great
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
that you can be a nurse that can be a
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
doctor but that uh there not a lot of
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
them want to do it not a lot of them
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to get there so if we can
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
incentivize them to to go that way then
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
that would be good for our constituents
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
who need Primary Care positions what
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
about this amendment are we okay well I
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
just I'm just going to say I'm now okay
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
with the bill and uh and what I want to
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
do is have this amendment brought up and
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment that clarifies
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
that um this this bill uh is only for
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners so when uh when I
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
get quiz when bills come in the future
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
and say uh me too I would say I can now
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
say to them well the reason we passed
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
this is because we were feel that we
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to do something to ensure that
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
there were enough primary care
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
physicians SL nurse practitioners out
 
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
there to satisfy the market that that's
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
in need yes re representative f rner um
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%

00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
vote because my daughter is actually a
 
00:54:39.799 --> 00:54:40.870 align:start position:0%

00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination I have a comment on this
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
one okay so I I would like to inter room
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
study it but yes go ahead your
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
comment well one comment I have is the
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
act is uh incorrect it says IVF and it
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
should be IUI but that's another that's
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
a good Troy that's true that's but
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's another that's another issue for
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
another I struggled with this one
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
because of medical
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
necessity it's cheap enough based on the
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it's cheap enough but I
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
struggled with the medical
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
necessity and then
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
chairman you very nicely gave us a list
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
of all the mandates that you have put in
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
place and one of those mandates is
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
coverage for contraceptive drugs and
 
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
services not a medical
 
00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.750 align:start position:0%
services not a medical
necessity

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
Medicade pays for vasectomies not a
 
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.430 align:start position:0%
Medicade pays for vasectomies not a
medical

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
necessity so the definition of medical
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
necessity has been
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
interpreted a little Loosely in in cases
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
when we decide that that's what we're
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
do getting past
 
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
good better than
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
nothing my my comment on the bill I I
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
agree with uh with Carrie but I think we
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
can expect in the next couple of years
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
um additional bill s that will be much
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
more expensive along the same lines I
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
think uh in passing that which I think
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
mind representative Barz my question is
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about infertility but are
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
two women who want to have a child
 
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.630 align:start position:0%
two women who want to have a child
necessarily

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
infertile is that the right word for it
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
well actually I I I took this thing out
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I was reading it really
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
carefully and actually it's not it says
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
infertility in the bill it says
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of so then when I read it
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
again it said so that means
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
a heterosexual couple or actually it
 
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
could it means that a woman who wants to
 
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.710 align:start position:0%
could it means that a woman who wants to
get

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
pregnant who's who's fertile obviously
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
okay a woman wants to have a baby down
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
have sex so so she's going to say is but
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
I I got my good friend here down the
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
street he's willing to be a donor so I
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to put in all that thousands
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
of dollars to get a donor but we're not
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
paying that bill doesn't include that
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
right yes this bill allows for this no
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't include the getting the
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
donor that doesn't include uh the donor
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
the whole as we heard was a whole huge
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
other expense right and so the reason
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
why this is only so cheap is that he
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
then provides whatever they need you
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
can't get it and put it in the
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
baster that's what this bill is is is
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
paying for this bill is allowing for a
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh other words in other words
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
so using your analogy now we're just
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
down to the $200 and and come on there's
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
when in the end of the day that if
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
people are choosing not you know that
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
they could they could do it but they're
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
choosing not to do it this is that's
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
where medical necessity is coming into
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
yes medical necessity of you know having
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
contraception okay was was that getting
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
control of the body and that was clearly
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
a uh I agree with you it pushed medical
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
necessity you know push the envelope on
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
it but that it was the issue was the
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
cost and how many you know cost and
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
you're going forward you know because in
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
terms of a lifetime you know contracep
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
and getting these you know the device
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
and so I agree with you with that
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation you know that was
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit of a stretch but
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
that it the political the politics of
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
the time was that uh we did not want
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
anybody to say that I couldn't get
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
contraceptive because I you know the
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the cost and that the the
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
monthly payments or whatever you know
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
would cost to to to have contraception
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
in this case what we're talking about is
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh that that this has nothing to do with
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
the personal
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
relationships of the people involved
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
okay so of the woman involved and and so
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
and I would say that that bothered me a
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
little bit that in the extra paragraph
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill they changed it from her to
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
them and I say oh my God are we really
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
going to get into that here in Commerce
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
do we really do we in Commerce want to
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
be into that discussion no no that part
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
no okay so that's when I started looking
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
back and I realized that it
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
says regardless of
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
infertility the whole bill is regardless
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
of infantility it's not even about
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
infantility at all I I I have to say
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
there's one thing that there's one
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
reason why and I didn't want to bring
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
this up but you're forcing
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
it what do we call it when a woman has
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
sex against her will and not because she
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
wants to what do we call that rape right
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're promoting by not
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
allowing this come on I'm sorry A woman
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
has the right to not want to do physical
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
sex she has that right and and she can
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
if she can go find a guy who's willing
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
donation for 200 bucks see she can get
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant no no you can't that's what you
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers that's what this
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
bill says no if you get done it on the
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
first time but you get up to six so it
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
could cost you $1,200 no if you don't
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
have the procedure the IUI procedure
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
itself your chances of getting pregnant
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
are very low they're already low to
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
begin with but they're very talk about a
 
01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.870 align:start position:0%
begin with but they're very talk about a
fertile

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
fertile
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
woman even if she's fertile what's the
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
difference it don't you don't get you
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
don't usually get pregnant on your first
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
do oh lighten
 
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.430 align:start position:0%
do oh lighten
[Laughter]

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
up I think we should I think I I just
 
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.269 align:start position:0%
up I think we should I think I I just
this

01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm not I'm not ready for
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you Chris what when
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
we had the that W woman couple in there
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
and there's all this money they had to
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
pay for the sperm why don't they just go
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
out and find somebody that they think is
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
intelligent athletic good-looking in as
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
sperm it was about the actual procedure
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
no I know but they could get that sperm
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
and take it and do the procedure
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely but it's just for the
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
procedure not the no I I understand that

Belgium
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon for record I'm
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
Michelle heat I'm the director of Life
 
03:25:49.189 --> 03:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
and Health at the New Hampshire
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department um I did not draft
 
03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I can help you walk
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
through it thank you um this is for the
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill relating to the co-pay accumulators
 
03:26:02.110 --> 03:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
or the so the coupons or discounts that
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
um pharmaceutical companies may give to
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
patients to help address their
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket cost and whether those
 
03:26:11.550 --> 03:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
discounts should be counted towards
 
03:26:13.710 --> 03:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
their the patients total out-of-pocket
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
Max So based off of feed back from the
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearing this amendment was drafted to
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of it and I believe
 
03:26:27.670 --> 03:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
what this will do is allow the discounts
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
to go
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
towards the out-of-pocket Max
 
03:26:35.670 --> 03:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
when those discounts are for drugs where
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
there is no other alternative treatment
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
option so it would not count in the
 
03:26:43.150 --> 03:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
cases where there is a generic or
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
biosimilar or some other um m maybe
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
lower cost treatment okay so where's
 
03:26:52.150 --> 03:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
that in this bill that is paragraph
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
two Oh and before we get there this
 
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
would be amending RSA 41518 FF so this
 
03:27:05.590 --> 03:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
is applicable only to group plans and
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
those are employer based plans right and
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
I see that on the back here is that
 
03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
that's the r numer five high deductible
 
03:27:13.319 --> 03:27:16.670 align:start position:0%
that's the r numer five high deductible
plan

03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:19.030 --> 03:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes there is um a carve out there for
 
03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
high deductible health plans because the
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
way those plans work is you have to meet
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
the deductible before the benefits kick
 
03:27:24.479 --> 03:27:26.269 align:start position:0%
the deductible before the benefits kick
in

03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:27:26.279 --> 03:27:29.670 align:start position:0%
in
right

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
um okay the majority of what this does
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
represent you have a
 
03:27:48.030 --> 03:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:27:53.349 --> 03:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
are when we talked last time we talked
 
03:27:58.830 --> 03:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
about tier
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
five now there are drugs still covered
 
03:28:07.269 --> 03:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
by uh patents and exclusivity rights
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
that are below tier five and this looks
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
like it would be applicable to those
 
03:28:16.429 --> 03:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
drugs that may not be anywh near as
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
expensive as the tier five drugs and we
 
03:28:20.229 --> 03:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
talked about only limiting it to tier
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
five we also said that we were going
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
to it wouldn't be forever that is if
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
another drug came along then it would
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
have to move over to that kind of drug
 
03:28:32.910 --> 03:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
or or you you know if there's once there
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
becomes a competition so there none of
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
that is in
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
there so it is if you look at um so if
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at Roman numeral 2 two
 
03:28:45.189 --> 03:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
which on the first page is lines 13
 
03:28:47.189 --> 03:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
through 19
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
it a shall apply to any amounts paid for
 
03:28:51.150 --> 03:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
blah blah
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
blah except in the case of a covered
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
prescription drug for which there's a
 
03:28:57.870 --> 03:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
generic alternative biosimilar or other
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
covered alternative available but it
 
03:29:01.950 --> 03:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the tier five
 
03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
limitation yes well tiering can be
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
subjective that's typically what you
 
03:29:08.189 --> 03:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
were describing is typically how tiering
 
03:29:10.830 --> 03:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
is done but it's up to the plan to
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
decide how many tiers and what drugs get
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
into those tiers so it can very it's not
 
03:29:19.830 --> 03:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
that all plans will have a fifth tier or
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
um that there's certain criteria for
 
03:29:24.910 --> 03:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
what gets on that fifth tier so it's not
 
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
linked to that because every formulary
 
03:29:29.469 --> 03:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
is going to be slightly different so
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're just giving
 
03:29:34.189 --> 03:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
this car blch pretty much all over the
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
place no well not if there's other
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
treatments available this it has to be
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
one of a kind it has to be a medication
 
03:29:42.630 --> 03:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
that is one of a kind where I'm having a
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
problem yeah you take something that
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
there are drugs that that are much less
 
03:29:51.229 --> 03:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
expensive than what I typically think of
 
03:29:53.229 --> 03:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
tier five and what we heard at the
 
03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
hearing drugs for $300,000 a year those
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
kind of things that are less expensive
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
but been have been able to hold on
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
to exclusivity for a while through all
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms not some of them necessarily
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
all that to be comfortable with and I
 
03:30:19.469 --> 03:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:23.469 --> 03:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
allowing the kind of uh payments that
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
would happen that would exclude other
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
people who are using generics and using
 
03:30:30.710 --> 03:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
biosimilar from getting the same benefit
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay so I and this has been part of my
 
03:30:36.269 --> 03:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
confusion too because of the other Bill
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
555 okay which is that they're giving
 
03:30:41.389 --> 03:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
those incentives because there is
 
03:30:43.950 --> 03:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
something another potential alternative
 
03:30:46.750 --> 03:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
that someone may be interested in what
 
03:30:48.590 --> 03:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do in this
 
03:30:51.630 --> 03:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is only
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
address those particular drugs
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
that you could say coincidentally a
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
really high really high price could
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
coincidentally many considered a your
 
03:31:08.670 --> 03:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
five but the end of the day they are so
 
03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
expensive that is is um and and for and
 
03:31:17.710 --> 03:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
and what the best we could do to try to
 
03:31:20.469 --> 03:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
identify that group and what we're
 
03:31:23.670 --> 03:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
trying to focus in on the best we can do
 
03:31:28.269 --> 03:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
is is that that there is no alternative
 
03:31:30.349 --> 03:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
there is no generic there is no
 
03:31:32.910 --> 03:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
biosimilar that we're just assuming that
 
03:31:35.229 --> 03:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
your whatever that drug is and that we
 
03:31:36.510 --> 03:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
heard about the
 
03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
hemophiliacs and the cystic cybrosys
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay that those drug that there's only
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
one drug but they are not the only types
 
03:31:47.910 --> 03:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
of drugs for which drug companies have
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
been able to establish exclusivity and
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's where I have the problem
 
03:31:55.229 --> 03:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
exclusivity alone is not what we want to
 
03:31:56.670 --> 03:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
cover I hear you but I telling you that
 
03:31:59.309 --> 03:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
exclusivity is not the issue that we're
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
trying to focus in on that's we're
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
exclusivity issue which was somewhat
 
03:32:07.710 --> 03:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
related to the other bill in this bill
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address that people have
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
that these drug
 
03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
companies know
 
03:32:18.870 --> 03:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they have a very unique drug it's a
 
03:32:21.670 --> 03:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
very specialized drug and they're
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
charging an arm and a leg for it they
 
03:32:25.469 --> 03:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
can get away with it because it's
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
special I understand that and so what
 
03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
we're saying is for those people who are
 
03:32:35.070 --> 03:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
page two in a high deductible
 
03:32:38.189 --> 03:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
plan because not because they chose it
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
if they were in they were in you know
 
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
getting their own health insurance but
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
because their employer chose it for them
 
03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
okay that we're going to say to them
 
03:32:51.550 --> 03:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
that yes that this independent charity
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
patient assistance program that these
 
03:32:57.510 --> 03:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies have created
 
03:33:00.670 --> 03:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
that you can get the take that money and
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
not worry about any tax complication or
 
03:33:05.229 --> 03:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
anybody you know getting a freebie or
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
whatever that you it's okay to accept
 
03:33:10.269 --> 03:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
get that money and use has to be through
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
an independent charity patient
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
assistance program exactly so this what
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk what is the biggest
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
governor in this bill that that's the
 
03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
governor is is that the the charity is
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
willing to give it because of this
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
truck they're not just giving they don't
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
give this charity assistance to anybody
 
03:33:31.389 --> 03:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
and everybody right okay okay they're
 
03:33:34.590 --> 03:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
only giving it to people who a have an
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
income they meet the income requirements
 
03:33:41.309 --> 03:33:41.319 align:start position:0%
but B but more importantly is that it
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
the drug is has an incredible High all
 
03:33:47.950 --> 03:33:47.960 align:start position:0%

deductible health plans are exempt from
 
03:34:09.309 --> 03:34:09.319 align:start position:0%

Action Network and we uh thank you for
 
03:34:41.469 --> 03:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and we uh thank you for
 
03:34:43.229 --> 03:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment and we would be in support
 
03:34:46.030 --> 03:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um just wanted to make
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
one suggestion that might make it a
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
little um clearer in paragraph 2 line
 
03:34:55.830 --> 03:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
18 um where it says covered prescription
 
03:34:58.189 --> 03:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
drug for which there is a generic
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
alternative biosimilar and another
 
03:35:01.150 --> 03:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
covered alternative
 
03:35:03.630 --> 03:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
available perhaps it might be a little
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
clearer if it said covered prescription
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
drug for which there is a lower cost
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
generic alternative bio similar or other
 
03:35:13.189 --> 03:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
covered alternative
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
available so you're adding lower cost
 
03:35:20.349 --> 03:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think so yeah no we I I that's
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
honorable to to put it in help clarify
 
03:35:24.910 --> 03:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
it but it's in this case we don't want
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
anybody to think this in this case there
 
03:35:28.950 --> 03:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
there is you don't want a lower cost
 
03:35:30.670 --> 03:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
alternative the lower cost it it
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't kick in in other words if there
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
was a lower cost they probably wouldn't
 
03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
be doing the charitable contribution no
 
03:35:40.750 --> 03:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay I thought it would make it
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
clearer for you I thought it would be
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
clearing up what representative spear
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
was trying to address but right if you
 
03:35:46.269 --> 03:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
don't think it would then I will
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
withdraw my suggestion it's it's an
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
interesting suggestion but I'm not sure
 
03:35:52.269 --> 03:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
but if it doesn't address it that way
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
then I'm I'm just trying to help but if
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work that way then I will
 
03:35:57.070 --> 03:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
withdraw the suggestion and again we
 
03:35:58.389 --> 03:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
would support the amendment and say
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for for uh for bringing it
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%

03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of Senator Bradley way back
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
when he sunsetted the
 
03:40:09.550 --> 03:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um and so you would think
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
that would be the rest of the story
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
except uh obviously when it came time to
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh what decide what we're going to do
 
03:40:20.590 --> 03:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
with it that um they decided to renew it
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then of course the bill had a bunch
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
of other things in there about how they
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
were going to renew
 
03:40:30.990 --> 03:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
it um and which was obviously
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
controversial because it was mandating
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
that all companies had to participate
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
even though some of the insurance
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
companies were not doing it so at the
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
end of the day um what we in terms of
 
03:40:46.269 --> 03:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the St stat and looking at
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
what it does in terms of how it handles
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
these things in fact that the in fact
 
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
that the the marketplace is actually
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
freewheeling in terms of how they do it
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
some do it some don't some you know
 
03:41:00.269 --> 03:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do in terms of
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
conditions they want to do it um this is
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
not a place where we need to to
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislate that uh let let them do what
 
03:41:10.990 --> 03:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
they want to do however uh in that
 
03:41:14.349 --> 03:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that we have just would
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
delete by this amend
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
there is some interesting uh information
 
03:41:23.469 --> 03:41:23.479 align:start position:0%
gathering parts to it and U I have
 
03:41:25.630 --> 03:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
gotten an agreement with the insurance
 
03:41:28.830 --> 03:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
department that they will uh put out a
 
03:41:30.990 --> 03:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
bulletin I'm not sure do everybody know
 
03:41:33.149 --> 03:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
what a bulletin is I we've gone across
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
that bridge yeah we did we did a
 
03:41:38.590 --> 03:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
bulletin last year right okay okay so a
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
bulletin is the department is sending
 
03:41:43.710 --> 03:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
out a notice to all its lenses in this
 
03:41:46.149 --> 03:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
case the insurance companies and telling
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
them uh in implementation of a certain
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
law or implementation of a certain
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
policy um here are the things
 
03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
expectations that they
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
have and so it's it's very clean uh in
 
03:42:00.670 --> 03:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
the sense that it's you know the
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
department is members um and it doesn't
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
require statutory you know creation um
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
and and there's and they have a comment
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
period and people can respond and
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of opportunity for the
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
lenses to to work with it um but but in
 
03:42:17.710 --> 03:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it gets us where we
 
03:42:20.110 --> 03:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
want to be without having to pass
 
03:42:22.269 --> 03:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
legislation see this
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
in it's not a rule no it's it's it's
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's out sort of outside of rule rule
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
making um so uh and having having uh
 
03:42:37.189 --> 03:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
agreed to picking up that language uh
 
03:42:40.149 --> 03:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
that the department said that uh they
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
agree with this
 
03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
solution which as you might uh remember
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
they were not too crazy about the
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
original bill so uh I think we have a
 
03:42:54.910 --> 03:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
problem anybody in the audience feel
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
differently speak now or forever more
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.399 --> 03:43:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
piece

03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
