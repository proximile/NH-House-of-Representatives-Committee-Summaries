uh
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
one of the most confusing things for
 
00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
one of the most confusing things for
people

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.629 align:start position:0%
people
is

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
finance for campaigns
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
the secretary
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me the attorney general's office
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
has a piece of paper
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
that they say well this is what it
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
really means the statute and we're not
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing if we have to have
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
another piece of paper from another
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
person that says this is what it really
 
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.389 align:start position:0%
person that says this is what it really
means

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
and they had a table there
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
so i went down to ols and i said
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
i want you to put the table in
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
well i said well wait we don't have any
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
tables in any part of the statute
 
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
tables in any part of the statute
anywhere

00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
i said i don't care i want the table in
 
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
i said i don't care i want the table in
okay

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.949 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
i guess from my request and other
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
requests that they've had both now and
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
they think that they have figured a way
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
to get a table in
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
and that is the the genesis of what you
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
see in this bill
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate is two tables
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay we had rousing discussion about
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
what's in there
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
we thought that last year that we had
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
gotten it down so that was uh
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
pre-primary and primary expenses and
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
then a second category for uh general
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
election expenses the attorney general
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
says nah you didn't get there
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
um you still have the three categories
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
so the table reflects the first table
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
that you see pretty much reflects what's
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
in statute right now about the different
 
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
in statute right now about the different
things

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
the second table
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
in the the senate bill is amended
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh actually is a
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in that first line that you
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
have in the table
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of it says unlimited
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
unlimited and unlimited
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
well the attorney general says that the
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
actual statutes that we have in place
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
all of those lines would be unlimited
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i said well that goes a little too
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
far for me
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
i had it even smaller and if you look
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
back at the bill's history you will see
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
where i suggested other things
 
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
where i suggested other things
but

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
many of the house members
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
i'm very frugal in what i spend on my
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
i'm very frugal in what i spend on my
campaign

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i spend a lot a lot less than a lot
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
of other senators
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh on their campaign so you know
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
the problem that you get into is when
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
you're transferring money at the end of
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
your tenure or
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
when you lose or whatever and you want
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
to pass that money on to someone else
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
you can pass it on to a charitable
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
organization you can pass it on to
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
another campaign campaign committee and
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
the reason why some of those numbers
 
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.710 align:start position:0%
the reason why some of those numbers
especially

00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the middle row
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the amended version which was
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
quite a bit less than that when the bill
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
started out
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
went to unlimited because
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
if somebody's already donated that money
 
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.949 align:start position:0%
if somebody's already donated that money
for

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
campaign expenses
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
then it is certainly reasonable that
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
that money continued to be used for
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
campaign expenses
 
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.670 align:start position:0%
campaign expenses
for

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
especially for the the candidate in the
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
same district but again that's all fair
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
game for you guys
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh the the main thrust of this bill is
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
so that a person who gets that
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
picks up that statute can understand
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
what the limits are
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
candidates candidate committees advocacy
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
organizations what happens to
 
00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:51.110 align:start position:0%
organizations what happens to
a

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
union what happens to
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
partnerships what happens to all of that
 
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.710 align:start position:0%
partnerships what happens to all of that
stuff

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
we did put in special provision
 
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.710 align:start position:0%
we did put in special provision
that

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
that unions etc would be able to form a
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
political action
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee of their own and to be able to
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
use segregated funds for that purpose
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
which matches federal law so
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a great bill you know
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
certainly i'd like to see a 20-0 vote
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
out of here or whatever your your
 
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.710 align:start position:0%
out of here or whatever your your
current

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee membership is
 
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.390 align:start position:0%
committee membership is
and

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members for
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any you've made it very
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
clear apparently so thank you very much
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning senator gray
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
um we do have someone who has signed up
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh olivia zink
 
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.470 align:start position:0%
uh olivia zink
welcome

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
good morning and for the record my name
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
is olivia zink executive director for
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
open democracy action
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
and i live in the city of franklin
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
the reason i signed up to oppose this
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill today
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
is one because it's under the prohibited
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
political contributions part of the law
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
so if senator gray explained that these
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
are in statute right now it should be in
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
the statute part of the law not
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited and i get that there's a
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
double negative
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
in line 17 but then when you say it's
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
unlimited it really throws me off so
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
you're limited to unlimited
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that should be in the regular part of
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
the law and not prohibited political
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
contributions section of the law
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i and i will just speak that i i do
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
believe unlimited political spending um
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
does not protect our democracy um and
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
further transparency in our elections so
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that we
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
have good standards and that our
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
campaign finance laws
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
provide the clarifications they need but
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
by putting this under the prohibition
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
and creating these double negatives in
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
statute i think create uh further
 
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.950 align:start position:0%
statute i think create uh further
confusion

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm trying to think
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
what the double negative means to the
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
term unlimited
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
because it's prohibited you're
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited to be unlimited but isn't a
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
contribution an amount by definition so
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's never unlimited
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
i mean you're causing me to think about
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
the double negative you can never not
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
you will always be on
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
not unlimited regardless of the amounts
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
yeah well if you're prohibiting
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
something that's unlimited right how are
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
you right how are you making a
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
prohibition on something that's
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
unlimited that's the confusion that i
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
think this causes
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
well i think that the answer is it can
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
be any amount but you're right it does
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
seem a little confusing
 
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.070 align:start position:0%
seem a little confusing
any

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
other questions for olivia's ape
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else here who wants to
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%

thank you for
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
i take no position i need you to
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
identify yourself yeah i'm sorry bob
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
served on this committee a number of
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
again i take no position on the bill but
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to stress
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
my angst at
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
when i see the word unlimited connected
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the words campaign contributions i
 
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
to the words campaign contributions i
worry

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
worry
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
there is much concentrated wealth in
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
america and we know in so many instances
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
wealth begets wealth
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
this week we learned that elon musk
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
bought 9.2 percent of twitter
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
according to forbes he is the world's
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
richest person with a wealth of 275
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
buying a controlling interest in twitter
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
cost him a mere 2.9 billion
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
one person
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
twitter reaches 330 million people with
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 206 million
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
monetized daily users
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
for someone on a mission which musk
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be he has a sizable megaphone
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
outsizing every voice
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
in this room times millions
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
he admits he bought it not only to
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
assert his position among the wealthy
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
who own media giants
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
but to make changes at twitter likely
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
code for increasing profitability
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
at his now personal mouthpiece
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
i can imagine he will use controversy to
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
increase profits
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
i don't have to imagine it
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
he has already stirred controversy
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
according to reporting from politico
 
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.909 align:start position:0%
according to reporting from politico
magazine

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
magazine
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
mr perry i appreciate your experience
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
and your position but i really am going
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
to ask you to focus in on this bill
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
and not the motives of elon musk in
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
buying shares of twitter
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
my point madam chair is that if anyone
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
has the ability to buy an election
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's elon musk representative perry
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to speak to the
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill because i think every member on
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
this committee can point out a number of
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
other people under that same logic that
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
could buy elections so let's continue
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
some people believe more money and more
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
speech is good
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
that it will lead to an expansion of
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
ideas upon which to build a more perfect
 
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start position:0%
ideas upon which to build a more perfect
union

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
union
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
to those i refer to the present
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
political environment of misinformation
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
disinformation outright lies and coming
 
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.270 align:start position:0%
disinformation outright lies and coming
up

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you to conclude now i
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
have never done that in a hearing but we
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
are not going to become a platform for
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
agenda i want comment on the bill and if
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're not next statement is not related
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
in regards to what you would like us to
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
do with the portion of the bill that you
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
find objectionable i'm going to thank
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and close the
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
with the words unlimited in this
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
amendment i hope we can begin to make
 
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
amendment i hope we can begin to make
changes

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
by eliminating the word unlimited
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
with respect to campaign contributions
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%

00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
be an amendment does anybody have any

um

00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:06.789 align:start position:0%
 
portal

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh this is an idea that uh
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's time has come
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
but it has one thing that
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
you were going to find that it has a
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
a very healthy price tag
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that price tag is
 
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that price tag is
that

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're the only ones
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
right now that are trying to do this
 
00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:31.550 align:start position:0%
that if other departments other
 
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.909 align:start position:0%
that if other departments other
[Music]

00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
divisions of state government
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
come into this and use that portal uh
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
that that price tag will be reduced and
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
reduced and reduced
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh certain things that you could do
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh for the dmv certain things that you
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
could do for
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
your taxes
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
combining that into the portal things
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you can do for
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
other functions in state government
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
what is my vision
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
my vision
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
as chair of the senate election law
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
a citizen
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's never a question of can they
 
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
there's never a question of can they
vote

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the question just becomes where can
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
they vote
 
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
they vote
so

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
through the portal
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
we want to use information that's out
 
00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:28.710 align:start position:0%
we want to use information that's out
there

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
probably this isn't secure information
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
anymore but i have a brother
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
here with his then girlfriend later his
 
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.109 align:start position:0%
here with his then girlfriend later his
wife

00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
that got married in new hampshire in
 
00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:42.950 align:start position:0%
that got married in new hampshire in
1966

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
1966
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
and my brother and sister stood up for
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
him at the city hall in dover okay
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
the city clerk has information they can
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
go into the vital records and look at
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
that marriage certificate and if
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
somebody can go in and tell me what my
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
brother and my sister's first name is
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure that that is somebody
 
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.990 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure that that is somebody
that

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know has the right to go vote
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
but this other thing's out there
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
you send people a tax bill
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
tax bill's got an account number on it
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can tell me what that account
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
number is see that's pretty good
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
information but that's not the kind of
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
information the portal uses the portal
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
uses a service
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
the way i understand it and the i.t
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
department can correct me if i'm wrong
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
but there are services out there you
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
know when you go into the bank and you
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
say oh i forgot my password and they ask
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%

you a list of phone numbers and say okay
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
which one of these
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
that information is in a database out
 
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.349 align:start position:0%
that information is in a database out
there

00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it's the same one or run by the
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
credit card companies the way i've been
 
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.230 align:start position:0%
credit card companies the way i've been
told

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
may be true not true but i'll let you
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
figure it out
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
and all that information isn't a big
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
database out there and you know what
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
because of all these other data
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
breaches you know for social security
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
number and other things they have looked
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
for these other things
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to prove identity and prove
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
who you are
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that's where i'm trying to get to
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that in every
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
they will have internet access and they
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
will be able to log in and say okay
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
we know this about you
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
right now on the current registration
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
form we ask for place of birth date of
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
birth we ask for the driver's license
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have the driver's
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
license please give me the last four
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
digits to your social security number
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
we also know if they were registered in
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
the state in another location
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
part of this you'll actually see
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at the 418 that's going to
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
come in front of you or you look at the
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that was never introduced over
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the senate for ways that that could
 
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.470 align:start position:0%
in the senate for ways that that could
happen

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
but the thing is identity we need
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know in the statute right now it
 
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.750 align:start position:0%
you know in the statute right now it
says

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
first of all you have to establish
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
identity so that the records you present
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
for citizenship domicile
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
etc and age
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
we know that they apply to you
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
this comes with a price tag and the
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
price tag is a lot more than what i
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
but again that cost
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
as other departments as other
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
get onto this program it'll be cut in
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
half it'll be cut into the third it'll
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
be cut into a fourth it'll be cut in
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
whatever number
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
of others
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is pope
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
it is poised on that precipice where we
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
need to start into this digital age
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
we've got people out there you know i
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
look at the polling place and i see a
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
line at the registration table
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay if there was an app
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
the person in line could start typing in
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
the information that's required and it's
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
that by the time they get there hit the
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
button the person says well i got this
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
number from the portal
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
the person goes in and check yep um yep
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
we've got all the stuff we need have one
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
form they write the number up at the top
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
they sign it show you their id and they
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
walk out registered
 
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.390 align:start position:0%
walk out registered
okay

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
those are my visions
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
but you got to take small steps
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
and one of those steps is this portal
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's expensive
 
00:38:57.839 --> 00:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
it's expensive
yep

00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
we're right up front about it it's
 
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.710 align:start position:0%
we're right up front about it it's
expensive

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
i hope that you'll look kindly on this
 
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
i hope that you'll look kindly on this
bill

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
again i'd like to see the 20-0 but you
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
know i'm i'm willing to discuss this
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
with anybody who wants to vote against
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
it and try to convince you
 
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.270 align:start position:0%
it and try to convince you
so

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gray any questions for
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative terosian
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you thank
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking the question so
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
as i understand this legislation it
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
would get the ball rolling with setting
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
this portal up uh in regards to towns
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
and municipalities um
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
would they have a choice to use it and
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
not use it or would they have to
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
all be
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
enrolled in this once it's complete the
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
portal as it's described in this bill
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be for the collection of
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
information to change party affiliation
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
to change name because you got married
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
to change address because you've moved
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
to change it change and change and right
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
now that would have an interface the my
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
vision is have an interface with the
 
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.230 align:start position:0%
vision is have an interface with the
existing

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.230 align:start position:0%
existing
computer

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we have and a notification would go
 
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.069 align:start position:0%
that we have and a notification would go
to

00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the checklist and the
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
clerk and that they would take the
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
additional actions that was needed to
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish the change
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think i forgot to mention party
 
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.390 align:start position:0%
i think i forgot to mention party
affiliation

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody wanted to change that but
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
the this portal would not be able to do
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
anything by itself
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
it would mean that that's the way you
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
could notify
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
the two groups the clerk's office and
 
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
the two groups the clerk's office and
the

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist and then
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
they would take it from there
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
let's say a change of name because you
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
got married
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
city clerk could go into vital records
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
if they were married in new hampshire
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
and be able to look in there and say yup
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
and probably accept the
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know just the information that was
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
on that form
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
but again that's all
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
up to the secretary of state and the
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
clerks and the supervisors of the
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
checklist who are already trained in
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
what they need for information
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the expenditures on this
 
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.910 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the expenditures on this
and

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
why is that and do you think that trend
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
would continue
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
would it continue to go up and double
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
each year and
 
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
each year and
well

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
part of what i've talked about is
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
this would be a subscription service
 
00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:42.630 align:start position:0%
this would be a subscription service
okay

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
that uh the person that turns 18 this
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
year probably doesn't have a lot of
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
credit card banking or other information
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's in that portal and so you know
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
two years from now
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
there will be additional information so
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
part of it is a subscription thing but
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
real details on that
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
they should be addressed to
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
and commissioner goulet would be
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of what
 
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.030 align:start position:0%
commissioner of what
ig

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
ig
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.390 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
representative

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
um could i just follow up and represent
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
your answer to representative prudent
 
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
your answer to representative prudent
o'brien

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
would this election portal have my
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
credit card information
 
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
credit card information
this

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
database would have
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
access to data
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the subscription service that they
 
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.109 align:start position:0%
in the subscription service that they
had

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
so it would not contain any information
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
um that is not uh either public record
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up follow-up chair um
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
how many other states use this a system
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
like this or the system that you're
 
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
like this or the system that you're
imagining

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
imagining
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
if the question is not
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
uses that system which is a thing i
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.190 align:start position:0%
don't know
but

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
like the city of rochester
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
for their economic development group
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to say
 
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.069 align:start position:0%
to be able to say
gee

00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
gee
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
this data says that
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
we need a clothing store over here uh
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
gee this data says that a shoe store
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
will do over there
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's all the same
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
kind of data that you've got so
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't hesitate to say that that
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
data is being used in
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
every state and in quite a few
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities within the state but i
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you that any of it is
 
00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:52.150 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you that any of it is
state-sanctioned

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
state-sanctioned
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
we have one more small follow-up
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.079 --> 00:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
would you welcome a a you know a study
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
group to to flesh out this idea or
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
are you convinced that it should be
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislated at this point in time
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh would i welcome a study group the
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
answer that is when you're the sponsor
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
of a bill is always no
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
i mean the reason the reason i put the
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill in is because
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's something that the time has
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
come we have in the senate as some of
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
the people behind me probably will
 
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
the people behind me probably will
testify

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
that it's an idea that we've talked
 
00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:32.309 align:start position:0%
that it's an idea that we've talked
about

00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
covid probably got in the way
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
mrs tentarelli even in some of her other
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
statements she told me i was her best
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
friend friend forever about three years
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
ago yeah you know because i am we try to
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
not hold anybody to prior statements
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
before they come in this room senator
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
gray it just causes all sorts of
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
problems we have we have that love-hate
 
00:44:55.839 --> 00:44:57.349 align:start position:0%
problems we have we have that love-hate
relationship

00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
we say no more that's fine let's move on
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
i mean this bill is your
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill now okay it is in your committee
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
you have control of it
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you representative
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
bergeron yes thank you this is a very
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
simple question i think senator gray
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
were you aware that
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire cities and towns and the
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
department of vital records already use
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
a service that you've described for
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
vital check if someone wants to order a
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
vital record they have to prove their
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
identity and vital check which is a
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
private corporation uses that type of
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
service there'll be four or five
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
questions that are generated using
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
credit reports and other public records
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
and the person has to answer those
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
questions correctly in order to have
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
access to be able to order a birth
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
certificate because here in new
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire those records are confidential
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
and this is how they establish the
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
identity of the person
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
that wants to access the record i will
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
certainly uh inform
 
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.670 align:start position:0%
certainly uh inform
uh

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet of your statement
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
and make sure he's got your phone number
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative hamer
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
hi senator gray um
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
is there a you mentioned about changing
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
your party affiliation
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
is there a time limit on that
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the election
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's kind of
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
not really part of this bill but
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
certainly there is
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
is that uh traditionally like in a
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
general election uh the period for being
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
able to change your party affiliation
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
stops at the
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
period of time when you can sign up as a
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
candidate uh so that there isn't people
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
that are swapping
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
in and out of parties during that time
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh and trying to use that as a way to
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
get an advantage
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
when they see somebody that's not signed
 
00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:52.069 align:start position:0%
when they see somebody that's not signed
up

00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
for a particular political party in a an
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
office they want uh in
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm told that in the far past they used
 
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.630 align:start position:0%
i'm told that in the far past they used
to

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
go down register for that party put
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
their name on the ballot and that's
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
prohibited now
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
it appears the members have no more
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
questions for you senator gray thank you
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning introducing
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on 425 i'm going
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
to recognize liz tentarelli next unless
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
she forgets what senator gray expects
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is liz
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
tentarelli i'm president of the league
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
of women voters of new hampshire
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
and when i first became aware of this
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill it was as an amendment
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
to i think it was a proposed uh
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
automatic voter registration bill that
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know as you can imagine didn't go
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere and that was two years ago and
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
so i was testifying in support of that
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
on the theory that people ought to be
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
able to register they can go to the dmv
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
and get their driver's license and maybe
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's a way to register at the same
 
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.109 align:start position:0%
there's a way to register at the same
time

00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
and then senator gray kind of waved
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
these papers at me and said look at this
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i embarrassed myself in the public
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
hearing by saying you're my bff now
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
so he's quite right in this story
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
while it's not an automatic voter
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
registration bill
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
it does allow people to start the voter
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
registration process online
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
they already have information in the
 
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.349 align:start position:0%
they already have information in the
system

00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it also allows them to change
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
addresses my grandson at that time was
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
moving from between jobs from college to
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
job to next job and changing apartments
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
in another state and he was able to do
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
all those address changes online so that
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
he could continue voting
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this system
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
as it was described then would would be
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
an advantage to voters you you know we
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
can all
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
change our party affiliation back to
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
undeclared as we leave the polling place
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that's confusing and
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
people forget to do it this would allow
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
someone to do that online later so i see
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as a real boon uh for voters
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
for convenience
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
and so i testified when this bill was in
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
the hou and the senate a few weeks ago
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
and said it's probably the only time
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
that i've been able to testify
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
in support of a bill that had all the
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
sponsors that were on the committee
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support sitting there
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then it got voted out of committee
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
unanimously ought to pass so
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
that was a joyous day for me and i just
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to encourage you to do the same
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
thing thank you
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms
 
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.549 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms
genterelli

00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
genterelli
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
seeing that thank you for being with us
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
this morning also signed up to speak we
 
00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
are on
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman of the
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
committee my name is michael o'brien
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of america votes i'm here
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
in support of the election information
 
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.829 align:start position:0%
in support of the election information
portal

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
um for many of the reasons that uh
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
listing charlie just expressed to you
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
all but also think about it in a
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
slightly different context i think you
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
know in a very short amount of time
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're about to spend a lot of time
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh voter registration and that process
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
and one of the advantages to the portal
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
um is that if folks are able to do this
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
before they get to election day uh it
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
lessens the number of folks who will
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
have to make these changes on election
 
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.829 align:start position:0%
have to make these changes on election
day

00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when we see affidavits filled
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
out if you talk to moderators and clerks
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
around the state it's because the person
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
has moved either out of ward
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
or into a new town and doesn't have the
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
necessary documentation with them and so
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
then they get put onto this affidavit
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
and now they're part of these these
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
numbers that we see and they you know
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
eventually do prove obviously um
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
these things but but getting ahead of
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
this and allowing folks do this online
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
would help to eliminate some of those
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
numbers it would give the attorney
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
general more time to use their limited
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
resources on uh folks who uh maybe
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
didn't use you know they're trying to
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
track down these folks they try to track
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
down after elections and so for those
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
reasons i think it's a good tool to help
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
us get in front of some of these numbers
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
that we see and for people have an
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
easier time proving who they you know
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
say they are where they say they live um
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so that would be the reason why you
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
know part of the reason we're supporting
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
this here today and i'm happy to take
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
any questions about it
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.069 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
i i have a question sure brian
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
as i'm listening to all this wonderful
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
information that you can get
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
online talking to somebody who hates
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
having to get online for anything
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
i heard one of the things that would say
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that you put in a couple of pieces of
 
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.630 align:start position:0%
that you put in a couple of pieces of
data

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
and you get to pick i think the example
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
this morning was your phone number so
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
depending on the design of the system
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
do you agree that you might be able to
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
find your way into somebody else's
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
information and i say that speaking to
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
someone who i recall at prior hearings
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
saying something which we're not
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to i just said don't do
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
talking about how common a name some
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
people have and that by that's a good
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
one that was a long time ago we had that
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
conversation you can input it and
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
end up
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
with somebody completely different so
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
here's what i'll say about this portal
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
that we've seen i think new hampshire
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
isn't now a very small minority of
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
states that don't have some sort of
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
online portal that they can use to
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
register to vote or to update addresses
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
or update information um so we don't
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
luckily we don't need to start from
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
scratch here and figuring this out we
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
have i think last time i knew and i
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
don't i can email the query but i think
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's 39 or 40 states have some sort of
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
online portal where folks can register
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
including other states that are nvra
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
exempt states or motor voter exempt
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
states um
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so luckily
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
we can look to them because these folks
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
have been doing this and it's not new
 
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.710 align:start position:0%
have been doing this and it's not new
anymore

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something that
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
states started doing over a decade ago
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
finally doing here and so
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
we can look to them and help figure out
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
what safeguards they use to make sure
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
that the right michael o'brien
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
is the one that's accessing that record
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately the final decision here still
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
rests with the supervisor of the
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
checklist the supervisor sees something
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
that they feel isn't quite right that
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite you know
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
compute for them they still have the
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
ultimate say on if that name goes on the
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
checklist or not right this is not an
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
automatic voter registration program or
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
automated voter registration program as
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
listener charlie just said and so i
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
think there are safeguards with the
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
system and we can look to other places
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
to figure out how best to secure
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
the information that we're talking about
 
00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
the information that we're talking about
and

00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
seeing nobody else on the committee
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
follow i'll see recognize representative
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
prudhomme o'brien i just wanted to make
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
a personal comment about common names i
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
am not related to the
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
man speaking right now and
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
the reason i have such a long name and
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
two last names is because the last name
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
is so common and i have experienced a
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
lot of problems such as almost getting a
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
medical procedure that i was not signed
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
because there was another kathy o'brien
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that's not really my name but that
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
was her name and she was in the waiting
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
room and she has a lot of problems
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
listen i've been uh you know this was a
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
long time ago probably uh in a different
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
time in history but when i was younger
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
had been uh my name was on a list and i
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
went into the airplane because there was
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
a michael o'brien probably somewhere in
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
ireland or northern ireland i suspect
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
that got flagged for some reason right
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
but they were able to determine who i
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
was there were steps to be taken to
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
figure out that the little 12 year old
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
boy who was trying to get on the
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
airplane was not the same one they were
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:54:58.559 --> 00:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
looking for
um

00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
and that's the point here right is there
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
are steps that you can take there are
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
places we can look to help figure this
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
out this is not new this is not we're
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
not venturing into some unknown land
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we've never been to before um and
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
so there are answers here that we can
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
find and i think we you know i saw the
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has put out an rfp
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
for a program like this um and i'm sure
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
the vendors can help explain that and
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're finding the right
 
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.430 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're finding the right
folks

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
all right and then my my fa
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
representative william
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify that you're not
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
the honorable state representative from
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
nashua is that correct i am not the
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
honorable because as he would often tell
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
me when i uh worked in the democratic
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
caucus that uh he's the original michael
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
o'brien uh
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask your
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
opinion on the development of this
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
because you just spoke to the fact that
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
we have other states that we can go to
 
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
we have other states that we can go to
and

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
you heard the sponsor ask be asked a
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
question about a study committee
 
00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.109 align:start position:0%
question about a study committee
so

00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes that our government
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies themselves develop this
 
00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:06.710 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies themselves develop this
portal

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
input this bill proposes the secretary
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
of state consulting with dit department
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
of safety division of motor vehicles
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
city and tower clerks supervisors of the
 
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.710 align:start position:0%
city and tower clerks supervisors of the
checklist

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any experience with other
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with this type of a
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
thing as to whether or not
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
those things either have an oversight or
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
people other than
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
employees of the bureaucracy overseeing
 
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.870 align:start position:0%
employees of the bureaucracy overseeing
it

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't have a good i would have
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
to think about that i don't think that i
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
have personal experience with that i
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
will say that again i think if we look
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
at other states um you can see that this
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
is the way they're developed and and the
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
fact that we're talking about
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
supervisors and clerks and moderators
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
having this voice is really important i
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
also i would have to look at the
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
effective date but i don't think it's
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
tomorrow right i think there's a bit of
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
time here for this to be developed in a
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
way that 60 days
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
but i've it within the i'd have to look
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
at the bill that's probably from passage
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
but then there's a time before the
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
system becomes live oh yeah correct so
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be time for this thing
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
to be built out this is not for 2022
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to like jam this in in
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
the next six months i think it's
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
probably before the 2024 election and so
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
there is time for this to be built out
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate way
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
within this
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill further questions from mr o'brien
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for joining us
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
this morning also signed up to speak on
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
olivia zinc open democracy and we're in
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
support of 425
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to speak to a couple of
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
things um i think it's really important
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
that we have a clean checklist
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
that the checklists are are updated and
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we know what are the voters i was
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
once checking in voters and somebody
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
came their last name was t
 
00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.030 align:start position:0%
came their last name was t
o

00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
o
 
00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
o
and

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
they weren't there and i was like you're
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
not a registered voter and they said to
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
me well i've voted before
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i just happened to check and they
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
were under the checklist as t a
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
and when the supervisor put them in they
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
made a mistake because their handwriting
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
they and we we pulled back the form and
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
we could understand how the supervisor
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the checklist made that that error on
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
the checklist but i think if people are
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
putting typing in their own name you're
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
likely not to have those kind of errors
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
happen um i just checked the national
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
committee on state legislators said
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
there's 42 states that have these kind
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
of other systems to answer that question
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has is not a new idea i think
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
it's been floating around the
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
legislature for at least six years
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
in concept form so as far as studying i
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
feel like it gets better and better each
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
time it's been introduced
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
to the point of the fiscal note it did
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
not cost california
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
this much money to implement a program
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
like that and i would venture to guess
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
california has a lot more registered
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
voters than we do in new hampshire so i
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't think the fiscal note will be
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
quite so high
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
as what is being proposed and i want to
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that the cost of
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
keeping the checklist up to date is
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
actually on the backs of our local
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
communities it costs about three to four
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to register to input the data
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
between the clerks and the supervisors
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the checklist many communities don't
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
pay their supervisors the checklist but
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of them do pay their supervisors
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the checklist to come in and enter
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
that data and it is about three to four
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollars per
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
person that they entered in and that
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
cost currently is being paid for
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
by cities and towns and so this does
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
centralize those costs and can save
 
00:59:45.359 --> 00:59:46.390 align:start position:0%
centralize those costs and can save
municipal

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
communities a little bit of money on
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
that registration
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
but that i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you for coming
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
um that is the last card i have for 425
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wants to speak
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
to 425
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm gonna close the public
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
hearing on 4
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
25 and it looks to me that we might be
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
right at 11 o'clock
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
so i am going to move on and open the
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
on 4 18.
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
um senator guida it was
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
has sent a message that he is not
 
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.430 align:start position:0%
has sent a message that he is not
available

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh for a little bit i suspect that this
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
will take until at least that point
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
um representative tarosian would you
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:39.670 align:start position:0%
would you
representative

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%

public testimony i understand senator
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
guida is planning on being here later
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
and will recognize him when he arrives
 
01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.190 align:start position:0%
and will recognize him when he arrives
excellent

01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
my name is james gray i'm a senator from
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
district six
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
um and this is uh
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418 uh relative to the
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
verification of voter affidavits
 
01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:19.750 align:start position:0%
verification of voter affidavits
um

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
as i've tested fired earlier today
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
certainly it is
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
my intention that
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
we make it as
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
unobtrusive as possible for people to
 
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:32.950 align:start position:0%
unobtrusive as possible for people to
vote

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the amendments that you'll
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
actually see in there
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
talks about uh
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh that was incorporated into the bill
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
talks about being able to use uh prior
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
election data uh to verify
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
um some of the information that's in
 
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.829 align:start position:0%
um some of the information that's in
there

01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh many people have talked about the
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this bill
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
um whether or not it will be found by
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
the courts
certainly

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
i consulted as chair of the senate
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
election law committee
 
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.589 align:start position:0%
election law committee
with

01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
various attorneys on that
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
and i got a variety of answers
 
01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
and i got a variety of answers
but

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
to sum up what my opinion after talking
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
to all of those
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
people is that on its face this bill is
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
not unconstitutional
 
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:25.990 align:start position:0%
not unconstitutional
that

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
but then when you look at the
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision
 
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.829 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision
about

01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:34.549 align:start position:0%
about
sb3

01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
sb3
 
01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:35.430 align:start position:0%
sb3
that

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
talking about long lines talking about
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
other things that are in there that are
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
not really provisions of the bill but
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
were reported to be
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
consequences of the bill and that's why
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
that cutting down that number of people
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
who would have to fill out an affidavit
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.069 align:start position:0%
in the first place
um

01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:57.349 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
some of the things that that aren't in
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
this bill that you may want to consider
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
you know ways to reduce that number of
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
lists or collect additional data
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
that would help you
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
find that individual afterward
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office i
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
believe will testify on whether or not
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would cause a problem
 
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.549 align:start position:0%
this bill would cause a problem
with

01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
the general election if done in the
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
primary or other elections
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
so i won't need to go there
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
this does not uh create
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
it creates an affidavit ballot and the
 
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
it creates an affidavit ballot and the
reason

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
that we use that term instead of
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh is to distinguish it from
 
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh is to distinguish it from
uh

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
the characteristics of the provisional
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
ballot so uh
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you have any more questions since i'm
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
just a substitute here
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
i'll try to answer them but uh when
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
senator guida does get here or the other
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
people who testify behind me uh
 
01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:01.349 align:start position:0%
people who testify behind me uh
certainly

01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
they can answer things i can't
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator questions
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you thank
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
senator this is probably a question i
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
think you might be able to help us out
 
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.190 align:start position:0%
think you might be able to help us out
with

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
during senate testimony
 
01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.549 align:start position:0%
during senate testimony
didn't

01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state scanlan suggest that
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
the senate might want to table it and
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
ask for an opinion from the supreme
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
court on the constitutionality of of
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
since that wasn't done could you explain
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
that the reasons behind that why not
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that in the senate we
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
would have to create a resolution uh
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
take the bill that was
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
the subject of that resolution
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
pass the resolution and send it off to
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
to do that would take this bill and
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
and move it at least to the next
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislative session since there was
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
still work going on in this bill up
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
until about a week and a half before
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
crossover and you know that
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
once i get to crossover
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
if it's the senate bill i lose my
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
ability to take action on it this year
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
as i did testify originally you know i
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
did consult with various attorneys
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
on the constitutionality of this bill uh
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
some said it was constitutional some
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
said it wasn't constitutional
 
01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:29.829 align:start position:0%
said it wasn't constitutional
but

01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
the ones who said it wasn't
 
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
the ones who said it wasn't
um

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
ben you know
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
led me to go back and look at the
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
decision on sb3 and read that from the
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court and the reasons that they
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
used and that again the amendment that
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
you see in there about using
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
prior data other data that's in the
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
election database to be able to to cut
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
down on the process time etc
 
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
down on the process time etc
was

01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why that was done
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee members for senator gray
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative teresian
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you again
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
senator for taking the question
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
so just to kind of follow up on that a
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
little bit um
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's been some chatter suggesting
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
that this would have a
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
legal problem uh some of the senate bill
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
3 but are you confident that
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's different enough
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
that this should pass any kind of legal
 
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.710 align:start position:0%
that this should pass any kind of legal
challenge

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
i would answer that question by telling
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%

chair miss barbara griffith and members

of the election law committee
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time to discuss
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418.
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
there are three main issues why i'm here
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
first in the case of a registered voter
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
that does not have their id available or
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
a resident wants to register on election
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
day but without enough id
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
the provisional ballot plus possible new
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
voter pack packet causes lines and
 
01:09:09.199 --> 01:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
voter pack packet causes lines and
confusion

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
next remember when the september primary
 
01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:14.229 align:start position:0%
next remember when the september primary
is

01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
but you will cover the military or those
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
citizens overseas
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the ballots must be mailed 45 days
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
before the general election
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
there is a strong possibility that those
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
ballots will not be received to be
 
01:09:30.159 --> 01:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
ballots will not be received to be
counted

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
counted
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
those ballots do not count they're not
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
received they're not counted
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
next there are privacy issues when a
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
ballot must be pulled by the moderator
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
names matched and sent to concord
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
when the voter did not contact the town
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
city or city clerk with complete
 
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
city or city clerk with complete
documentation

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
election night results are just sort of
 
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.669 align:start position:0%
election night results are just sort of
totals

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
totals
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
subject to change 10 days later
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
these sort of totals for new hampshire
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
and being first in the nation state
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
election results
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
that is a very difficult to take on the
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
national scene
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
quotes from coelection day workers the
 
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.669 align:start position:0%
quotes from coelection day workers the
bill

01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
the quote
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
it is a solution in search of a problem
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
where or who will foot the bill for the
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
27 prepaid mailers the state
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
or town city
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh downshifting to local levels of
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
expenses exists
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
the current affidavit used on election
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
day is sufficient
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
without the provisional ballot
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
as one of rawlinsford's supervisors i
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
look forward to being serviceable to the
 
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.070 align:start position:0%
look forward to being serviceable to the
voters

01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
the constitutional right of privacy
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
the right to register and vote on
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
i can visualize an example of a parent
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
carrying a very young child arriving at
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
the polling location picked up from a
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
sitter after work and the supervisor
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
asked for an id that by chance was
 
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.189 align:start position:0%
asked for an id that by chance was
forgotten

01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
forgotten
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
the parent is tired very tired and he or
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
she must go through extra procedures to
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
be sure
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
his or her vote counts
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
a photo must be taken clip it to
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%

bergeron would like to ask you a
 
01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
bergeron would like to ask you a
question

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have to take it if you don't
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
want okay
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron is usually
 
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
pretty nice i try to be kind so i won't
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
i won't put you on a spot but
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is a question i think is perfect
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
first to ask of a supervisor of the
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
checklist uh at the polls what's your
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
role is it to register people to vote
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's part of it yes okay um
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
currently i'm sorry follow up
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
currently if someone goes to the
 
01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:33.750 align:start position:0%
currently if someone goes to the
checklist

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have an id they're directed
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
to go to a no id table where they fill
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
out the affidavit and uh and have their
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
picture taken
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would require the voter to go
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
to your table the voter registration
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
table even though they're already
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
registered to vote
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
at that point you redirect them back to
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
the moderator for the no id table and
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
they have to fill out the affidavit and
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
have their picture done
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
does it make any sense to you that the
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
voter is going to have to get away from
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
the checklist wait in line at your table
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
only to be sent over to the see the
 
01:14:03.679 --> 01:14:05.189 align:start position:0%
only to be sent over to the see the
moderator

01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
well i guess it's situational uh per
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
town of uh exact placement and uh
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
sequence of events
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
i do know
 
01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:17.350 align:start position:0%
i do know
um

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
in rollinsford
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
that when uh
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
they don't have their id with the ballot
 
01:14:23.199 --> 01:14:24.149 align:start position:0%
they don't have their id with the ballot
clerk

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
and they come to the one of three of us
 
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.390 align:start position:0%
and they come to the one of three of us
and

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
um if the other busy i'm here to um
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that they fill out the
 
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.630 align:start position:0%
make sure that they fill out the
affidavit

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
and uh let them know to um you know
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
bring in their
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
their id and um
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
but maybe due to the size of uh
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
rollinsford that if they don't bring it
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
in uh everyone seems to know who to call
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
to get their id
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it's it's fine it's um it's amazing
 
01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.630 align:start position:0%
and it's it's fine it's um it's amazing
uh

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
if um even if someone
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have their id and then there's a
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
little locale but um
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%

hi my name is louise spencer
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
and um i'm from concord new hampshire
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i am the co-founder of the country
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
coalition which is an all volunteer
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
grassroots advocacy organization
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking here today on my own behalf
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
but i know for a fact that many many
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
members of our organization
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
signed in on
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
this bill to oppose it
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that i feel very comfortable
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
saying that kent street opposes this
 
01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.709 align:start position:0%
saying that kent street opposes this
bill

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
um what i'd like to speak to is
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
following up
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
on the prior
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
what the prior speaker spoke to
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
which is the logistical nightmare that
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
would present
 
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.709 align:start position:0%
would present
for

01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:08.719 --> 01:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
on election day and it speaks to many of
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised in the sb3
 
01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised in the sb3
lawsuit

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amount of extra time
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
that will be added to
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
the process of registering to vote and
 
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.790 align:start position:0%
the process of registering to vote and
voting

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.189 align:start position:0%
voting
so

01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
that i know that there's an effort to
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
try to provide alternative ways to
 
01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.149 align:start position:0%
try to provide alternative ways to
verify

01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
verify
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
voter information um for those voters
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
who are already
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
registered but perhaps don't have their
 
01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
registered but perhaps don't have their
id

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
id
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
when i
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
observed the election in windham
 
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
observed the election in windham
recently

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
i spoke to the supervisors of the
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
checklist there
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
they said it's one thing if it's a slow
 
01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.030 align:start position:0%
they said it's one thing if it's a slow
election

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
but when it's a busy general election
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
particularly a presidential election
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
they have very little time to do
 
01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.430 align:start position:0%
they have very little time to do
anything

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
but to actually register
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
the voters and move them along
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
so they have very little time to get on
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
a computer to check election net
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
and often
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
during a very busy election election net
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
is down and they can't even access that
 
01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.990 align:start position:0%
is down and they can't even access that
information

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about adding a whole
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
another layer of process
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
on top of
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
in busy
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
precincts a process that's already
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
can result in lines so i think when
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a small town this
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
may not appear to have much of an impact
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
but if you've ever been to elections in
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
durham or windham or hanover or some of
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
the places where
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
where you
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
tend to
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
get long lines anyway
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
as soon as you start adding on extra
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
steps and extra process you
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
start adding extra time
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
and that is something that
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
creates difficulties
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
for the voter and certainly for election
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
officials so i really urge you to vote
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
itl on this bill so thank you very much
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms spencer
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
sorry kevin
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you madam
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
chair ma'am thank you for taking the
 
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
chair ma'am thank you for taking the
question

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
so under current law is it more
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
efficient and more timely if the voter
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
when they come to the polls has a
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know valid id with them
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
it certainly is and when i go out and do
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
to speak with voters i always encourage
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
them to bring
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
the documentation whatever documentation
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
that will help make the process as
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
smooth as possible i would love to see
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
us do more education prior to elections
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
so that voters are
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
really aware of what they need to bring
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's not always clear on town and city
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
websites and i think we could do a huge
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
effort in terms of voter education about
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
what can make the process go smoother
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
smoother i'm also aware as someone spoke
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
to about you know the mother that shows
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
up quickly after work having picked up
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
her kid at child care oh my gosh i
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
forgot my license um that that happens
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
the other issue i would point out is
 
01:20:29.679 --> 01:20:30.790 align:start position:0%
the other issue i would point out is
that

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
this was a purge year
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are going to be
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
showing up thinking that they are on the
 
01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
showing up thinking that they are on the
rolls

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
rolls
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
only to find out they aren't and they
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
will not necessarily come with their
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
passport in hand and their birth
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
certificate in hand because
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
they will think that they've already
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
established those qualifications
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
sure further questions from committee
 
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.070 align:start position:0%
sure further questions from committee
members

when i read about this bill it
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to focus pretty much on the
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot part which has already
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
been mentioned briefly
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%

um i'd like to start my testimony by
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
asking the committee a question have you
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
seen the movie saving private ryan it's
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
been over 20 almost 25 years so uh that
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
movie came out in 1988 i saw it with my
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
my wife and friends and before it left
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
the movie theaters then there wasn't any
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
hbo thing that
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
got my three late teenage children to go
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
see the movie with me which i don't
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
think i had done before since i wanted
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
them to see that first 23 minutes if you
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
remember the movie it was pretty stark
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
invading omaha beach on june 6 1944
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
i remember when we got out of the movie
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
one of my children said so what's the
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
message dad and i said well if i find
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
out you don't vote i'm going to disown
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
you and you're all about to go to
 
01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.229 align:start position:0%
you and you're all about to go to
college

01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i i track it they do vote
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
i did i looked up a little history
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
because it was a personal thing to me in
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
some extent during world war ii it was
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
very hard to get those gis to get the
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
vote so they passed the bill on 42
 
01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:50.629 align:start position:0%
vote so they passed the bill on 42
saying

01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
saying
um

01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
we'll send them absentee ballots but it
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't happening so by 44 right about
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
the time of d-day
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh more emphasis was pushed on the state
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:23:01.199 --> 01:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
to do it
and

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
it didn't work all that well either i
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
mean there was a lot of it was not
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
coincidental because d-day was in the
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
news and so forth
 
01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:11.430 align:start position:0%
news and so forth
um

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
going fast forward a bit in the 70s i
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
found myself living in scotland
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
for two years and i wanted to vote in
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
the election at that point my residence
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
being was massachusetts it was a bit of
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
a problem getting they have seen ballot
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
but i got it and i voted
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then two years later i found myself
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
living for two years as an active duty
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
person in the air force
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
and when i was overseas then it was also
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
a challenge my my state at that point by
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
record was massachusetts so i
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
i felt at that point something better
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
ought to happen and it did in 1986 under
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
the reagan administration
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
they passed the uoca va the thing that
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're all talking about and it's
 
01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.709 align:start position:0%
you're all talking about and it's
uniformed

01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
uniformed
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
and overseas citizens so back when i was
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
in scotland for a year i was an overseas
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
citizen they fit that category and
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's where you heard all the rules
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
about 45 days i'm not going to go over
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
it because it's already been mentioned
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
so basically this bill makes it really
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
hard for that absentee valid not only
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
for the uniform folks but anybody who's
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
working a job let's say in london for a
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
year or two
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
to get through and vote
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
not only in this primary but in general
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
the general election will be very
 
01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
the general election will be very
difficult

01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
adding the 10 to 14 days makes it
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible so
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
my final comment is basically uh you
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
know let's not forget what those folks
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
did on omaha beach
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
this law that was based on the
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
reagan administration is a really good
 
01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:41.350 align:start position:0%
reagan administration is a really good
idea

01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
and and should be enforced and i think
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
the solution i have to believe the
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
people who wrote this bill just didn't
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
think about this
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to pass this bill
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
and you want a solution one of two
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
things either you lengthen the time
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
between the primary and the election
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
so you've got those 14 days kicked in
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
and you still have 45 days or the option
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
is make it possible like 31 other states
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're in a group of 19 that you can't do
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot electronically so
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
that may be even a quicker solution you
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
might even have time between now and the
 
01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
might even have time between now and the
fall

01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that's all i'd like to say thank you
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony does
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
 
01:25:18.639 --> 01:25:20.790 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
witness

01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
witness
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks for joining us good
 
01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks for joining us good
morning

01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
my written testimony should have been
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
i promise i'm not going to read this
 
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:54.070 align:start position:0%
i promise i'm not going to read this
binder

01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
my name is lisa danis and i am
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of the brennan
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
center for justice about the significant
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
chance that new hampshire will lose its
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
exemption to the national voter
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
registration act if it passes senate
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
bill 418.
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
i have been working on nvra
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
implementation and enforcement for over
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
15 years
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
and uh in fact i brought with me today
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
one of the original paper handbooks on
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of the nvra
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
the handbook is hundreds of pages long
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
detailing requirements that new
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire will have to implement and
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
comply with if it loses its exemption
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
and losing its exemption is a one-way
 
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.910 align:start position:0%
and losing its exemption is a one-way
street

01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
street
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
once new hampshire loses its exemption
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
it cannot get it back
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
sb 418 could cost new hampshire its
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
exemption for two reasons at least
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
first sb 418 would be a substantive
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
change to election day registration such
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
that the law likely will not qualify as
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
in effect continuously and therefore
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
the law that triggered the exemption
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
will no longer remain in effect
 
01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.470 align:start position:0%
will no longer remain in effect
second

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
sb 418 changes the edr law so that not
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
every eligible voter is able to register
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
at the polling place a key requirement
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the nvra exemption
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire loses its nvra
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
exemption the law
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
must be implemented immediately
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire will face multiple
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
consequences requiring money time and
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
staffing resources
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to get through the
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
whole list of what new hampshire will
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to do i don't know if i can do it
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the time limit but i'll try i'll
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually stipulate you
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
can't how's that all right well i'll do
 
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:48.210 align:start position:0%
my best
 
01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
my best
[Laughter]

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
first new hampshire so my suggestion is
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
if there's something
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
you want to say in conclusion to the
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
list because i'm pretty familiar i know
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with the list so go ahead
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right so first new hampshire
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
will have to begin offering simultaneous
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
drivers license and voter registration
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
applications in person and online and
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
will have to do the same for driver's
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
license renewal applications it will
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
have to implement robust voter
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
registration services as part of each
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
application renewal and change of
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
address through any agency providing
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
public assistance and any state-funded
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
office primarily serving people with
 
01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:23.669 align:start position:0%
office primarily serving people with
disabilities

01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
these changes require new hampshire to
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
design and distribute new forms rewrite
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
policies and retrain employees at all of
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
these agencies
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would have to begin
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
accepting the federal mail voter
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
registration form from any eligible
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
citizen who submits it this could
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
greatly increase the volume of new
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters using mail registration
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
and also would preclude new hampshire
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
from requiring
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
the federal form to be notarized or
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that a voter provide
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
documentary proof of citizenship
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would have to change the
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
way election officials handle
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
voter list maintenance and purging the
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
nvra regulates list maintenance in a lot
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
of ways including a bar on systemic
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
removal of voters within 90 days of any
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
federal election and removing voters for
 
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.550 align:start position:0%
federal election and removing voters for
suspicion

01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
suspicion
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
sorry for inactivity without first
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
sending a specific notice
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
and waiting through two federal election
 
01:29:18.639 --> 01:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
and waiting through two federal election
cycles

01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
cycles
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
and significantly
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire fails to implement any
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
of these new requirements does so out of
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with the statute or fails to
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
take the requirements seriously the
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
state can be sued indeed should expect
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
to be sued
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
by the department of justice or private
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
litigants and any private party that
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
prevails against the state would be able
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
to seek payment of attorneys fees costs
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and expenses i'm going to need you to
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
wrap up okay i think you wouldn't make
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
i urge this committee to refrain from
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
advancing this
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
question so when i read this bill uh the
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
first thing i saw was they're trying to
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
find a way
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
to get around the nvra um
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm a fan of the nvra um there's things
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the mvra that i really like um like
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
we could get rid of same-day
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
registration and have a robust
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
registration program before the day
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
thereby ending the lines on election day
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
smoothing up the process of um
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
of of getting people through
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
through to the ballot um we could do
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
other things such as not having a
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
10-year purge where if the if the like
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
right now we just did our purge and our
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
voter rolls shrank 25
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
which means 25 percent of our voter roll
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
was inaccurate we can't do it any more
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
often than that because we're not in
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
nvra we can't actually require somebody
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
to show an id when they're registering
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
to vote or voting because of the nvra
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
because we're not doing these things so
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying that with this bill
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
we would trigger the nvra and new
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire would go under the nvra and
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
then we could implement the other
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of the nvra
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh you would have to implement the other
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
provisions of the npra thank you
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh do you have a
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
sense of how much it would cost the
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to implement uh
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
the nva ra programs that you outlined so
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
there is an independent estimate of that
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
and if it's okay it's actually in the
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
text on my phone is it okay for me to
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
i got that estimate just before i walked
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
in the door so
 
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:49.910 align:start position:0%
in the door so
um

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
an independent estimate has put it at
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
6.5 million dollars in upfront costs
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
2.5 million dollars annually and then
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
whatever is awarded as part of
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
attorney's visas costs and expenses in
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you

uh thank you madam chair my name is
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
peter bassellier i'm the um i'm from
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
milford i am the town moderator and the
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
school district moderator and i've been
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
serving in those roles
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
since 2008.
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
my goal as a moderator as i've said many
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
times over the years is to ensure that
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have a safe secure and trustworthy
 
01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.709 align:start position:0%
we have a safe secure and trustworthy
election

01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm opposed to the
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislation the as as proposed
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
and as amended as i understand it i
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
provided the committee with a lengthy uh
 
01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.270 align:start position:0%
provided the committee with a lengthy uh
email

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't intend to go into that in detail
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
today unless you prompt me to
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
but i would like to point out 5.5
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
important items that relate to the
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
first is that there is no definition of
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit valid
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
and by that i'm talking about the
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
definition the description of the actual
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
ballot itself what does it look like
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
in and one point to consider is does it
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
need to have the phrase affidavit ballot
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
printed on the document
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the language that
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
addresses how this will look what kind
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
of paper it ought to be on is it a
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
colored paper if it's a colored paper
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
but how do we distinguish it between
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh other ballots
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
um you know at a primary election for
 
01:34:02.159 --> 01:34:03.590 align:start position:0%
um you know at a primary election for
example

01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
another aspect of this legislation is
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
that it is going to be very difficult to
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
disguise a voter's name
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
keeping that person's uh
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
confidential if their
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
ballot is removed from the tally
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
in milford we have almost 10 000
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
registered voters and at the march
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
election last month we had one abs uh
 
01:34:28.239 --> 01:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
election last month we had one abs uh
cva

01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
cva
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
so if that person um had doesn't provide
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriate documentation to the
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
secretary of state within 10 days that
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
person is going to be there their vote
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be removed
 
01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.350 align:start position:0%
is going to be removed
now

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
during the course of the day depending
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
upon what that ballot looks like
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
voters who are in the polling place
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
election officials who are in the
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
polling place will know that though
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
there's the one person that went through
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
had an affidavit ballot
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
and is now their vote is being removed
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
because they didn't provide um
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
documentation in a timely fashion
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
this gets me to another very important
 
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
this gets me to another very important
point

01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
and that is the uh the 10 days
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
within which the voter has to provide
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
the necessary information
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's a serious uh flaw
 
01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.590 align:start position:0%
i think that's a serious uh flaw
because

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
it what happens if a person mails the
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
package to
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
on the 10th day
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
and it arrives at the secretary of
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
state's office on the 12th or 13th day
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
because of a a weekend or a holiday
 
01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.750 align:start position:0%
because of a a weekend or a holiday
i

01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
suggest strongly that you consider a
 
01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
suggest strongly that you consider a
postmark

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
postmark
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
that the packet has to be postmarked
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
by a certain date so that everybody
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
knows including the voter and the voter
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
can prove to anybody after the fact that
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
they did submit their their
 
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.830 align:start position:0%
they did submit their their
documentation

01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
and indeed if they were to be wrongly
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
removed because they did provide the
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
information at least they would have
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
evidence to show to the secretary of
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
state that i did my part the postal
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
service for whatever reason did not
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
deliver on time
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could wrap up
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if you could wrap up just over
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
the three minutes um
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
the other is what i would really like to
 
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
the other is what i would really like to
suggest

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
is based on partly on my experience back
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
in 2013 when we were 15 when we first
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
had the voter id
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
photo id
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
the very first person to come into the
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
milford polling place and asked me to
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
vouch for them
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
no lie
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
was senate president peter bragdon
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
it was march election he left his um his
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
id out in the car and he had to get the
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
carcad as quickly as possible
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think that if you were to make this
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
work focus please on
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
the people who are trying to register
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
the vote and don't have the necessary
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
information but if a voter like mr
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
bragnan or like myself i've been voting
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
in town for many many decades now if we
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
know that those people are already
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
registered and they only forgot their
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
id why do we ask them to go out to the
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
car why do we ask them to go home let's
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
have them fill out the cva
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
and just follow the normal course as it
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
exists today but have a separate if you
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
wish process for the newly registered
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
vote or the voter who would like to
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
register and does not have the necessary
 
01:37:26.639 --> 01:37:27.830 align:start position:0%
register and does not have the necessary
information

01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
let's not penalize the people who have
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
made a sincere effort to come to the
 
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.750 align:start position:0%
made a sincere effort to come to the
polls

01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
polls
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
and vote by having them do something
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
that a person who is voting by absentee
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
does not have to do thank you thank you
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions i'm sure
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.590 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
testimony

01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
the talk about the need to describe what
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
an affidavit ballot is
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in state law 656 16
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
which currently states there shall be no
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
impression or mark to distinguish one
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
general election ballot from another end
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
quote and
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's not being um
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
repealed under house senate bill 418
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
in your opinion as a moderator where the
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill says the moderator shall mark each
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot affidavit ballot number
 
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:16.709 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot affidavit ballot number
such

01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't that be in conflict with
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
existing law that there shall be no
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
impression or mark placed on the ballots
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
to distinguish them it would certainly
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
can you pretend
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
tallersky thank you madam chairman thank
 
01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.830 align:start position:0%
tallersky thank you madam chairman thank
you

01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh the
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
way you described um
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
your example of having one challenge
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
voter affidavit
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
when you at the end of the night pull
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
out all the ballots and sort them and
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
just count them to make sure that your
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
numbers all line up what i understand is
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
that if you have that one
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
yellow ballot or marked ballot whatever
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
the election officials who know that
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
john doe
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
filled out that one would be able to see
 
01:39:06.159 --> 01:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
filled out that one would be able to see
exactly

01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
who he voted for is did i understand
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
that correctly yes no that's that's
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
correct under the proposal if um if
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's the one affidavit ballot um and
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
um whoever's whatever whoever the
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
election official is that is handling
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
that ballot will if they know who
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
completed the ballot they'll know how
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
they voted absolutely
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
but we also on the other hand we also
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
trust our election officials and when
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm assisting a voter i'm not really
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
looking at how they vote and so we're
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
still in that process while it it's
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
entirely possible for a for me pulling
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
the ballot out of the box of the pocket
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
on the side of the accuvope machine in
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
order to have it counted by hand um the
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
bigger point is that that ballot if it's
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
distinguished enough so that it's it's
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
different from the town or the school or
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
the primary or the general election
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
ballot that whatever the election is
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
other people who are in the polling
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
place who are not constrained by
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
election law to handle this information
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
confidentially will have an idea of who
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
that individual was and how they voted
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
if the tally is removed
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you i'm sure
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee my name
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
is linda bundy i'm from antrim
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with governor sununu that new
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's election process has
 
01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire's election process has
integrity

01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
that it works and that our this our
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
citizens believe in our system
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
causes cases of fraudulent voting are
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
rare in 2016 over six thousand voters
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
signed domicile affidavits
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
only 66 could not be verified
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office said that
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
these do not necessarily represent fraud
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
rather an investigation that could not
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
be closed
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
sb 418
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
will require that when voters do not
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
have valid voter ids and do not mail in
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
missing documents within 10 days their
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
votes will be deducted from the count
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
final election results may be delayed as
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
much as 14 days after the election
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
this delay affects the votes of active
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
service members and other citizens
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
living outside of the united states
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
by law they are required to receive
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
ballots at least 45 days before federal
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
elections which may not be possible
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
under sb 418.
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
this situation could violate new
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire's motor voter exception to the
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
national voter registration act governor
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
sununu said that this legislation would
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
be contrary to that agreement
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
the process involved with this proposed
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot is likely to confuse
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
voters some may decide not to vote
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
others may not understand what to do
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the packet and not follow through
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
after voting
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
lines at the polls will move more slowly
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
as election workers take the time to
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
explain the affidavit affidavit packet
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
to voters the packet will incur the
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
added expense of a prepaid overnight
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
mailing envelope
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
secretary of state scanlon has said that
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
additional temporary staff will have to
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
be hired to handle the workload
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
the affidavit ballot process has the
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
potential to violate the privacy of the
 
01:43:08.239 --> 01:43:09.109 align:start position:0%
potential to violate the privacy of the
vote

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
after 10 days the secretary of state's
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
office will notify towns which ballots
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
are missing required documents town
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
officials will retrieve those ballots
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
and deduct the votes from the final
 
01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.629 align:start position:0%
and deduct the votes from the final
counts

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
counts
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
especially in small towns but really in
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
any town the identity of the voters
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
could be known
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of sb 418 has said
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that voters just have to sign a piece of
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
paper to vote without valid photo ids
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
however they are not simply signing a
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
paper they are signing an affidavit a
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
legal document and swearing to and
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
affirming the truth of their statements
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
conviction of lying on an affidavit has
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
consequences of a fine up to five
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and up to one year in
 
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.430 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and up to one year in
jail

01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
jail
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
sb 418 is unnecessary it attempts to
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that doesn't exist
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
by alleging fraud it sows distrust among
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
voters it creates hurdles that will
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
suppress the vote when our elections are
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
already secure
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
accurate and reliable
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
democracy works when people participate

opportunity to appear today
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
over the last two years i've had the
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity to participate in our
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
democracy by
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
volunteering in the town of bedford's
 
01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.149 align:start position:0%
volunteering in the town of bedford's
elections

01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
my experience has shown me how dedicated
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire election officials are to
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
running fair free and honest elections
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
and has given me an understanding of the
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
checks and balances that are currently
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
in place to ensure that all votes are
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
cast legally and that all eligible
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
voters have the opportunity to make
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
their voices heard
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
rather than protect election integrity
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
sp 418 would hamper the elections
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
process by adding additional redundant
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
steps for those registering to vote for
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
the first time as well as voters who do
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
not have identification with them at the
 
01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:36.950 align:start position:0%
not have identification with them at the
polls

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
polls
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
implementing these steps would create
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
difficulty for election officials
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
requiring additional staffing and
 
01:45:41.679 --> 01:45:42.629 align:start position:0%
requiring additional staffing and
funding

01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore the 10-day waiting period
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
for affidavit verification would
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
inevitably delay the process of
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
finalizing and certifying vote totals
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
at a time when election officials have
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
already faced unprecedented controversy
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
this additional roadblock could inspire
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
further distrust in our elections as
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
well as encourage bad faith actors to
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
promote accusations of fraud or
 
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.270 align:start position:0%
promote accusations of fraud or
wrongdoing

01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
for voters sb 418's affidavit
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
verification requirements negate the
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
privacy that are is currently insured by
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
secret ballots
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
currently affidavit voters are given the
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
same paper ballot as all other voters
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
paired with an affidavit form ensuring
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that their vote is legitimate
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
however sb418 would require that
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots are given a unique
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
identifier to track the ballot for
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
removal if the packet of information
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
given to the voter is not returned to
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
it bears noting that the contents of
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
this packet are not outlined in this
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
bill so it's unknown how deeply
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
this packet distribution process will
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
complicate on-site voting
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
the unique identifier also means the
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
poll workers could potentially identify
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
who voters cast their ballots for
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
the senate committee heard testimony
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
from local elections officials
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
expressing their concern about compiling
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
the sensitive information and for good
 
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
the sensitive information and for good
reason

01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
these privacy concerns coupled with the
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
time needed to complete these steps
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
creates a two-tiered voting system with
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
the likely impact of discouraging
 
01:47:00.719 --> 01:47:01.990 align:start position:0%
the likely impact of discouraging
turnout

01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
turnout
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
i also have concerns regarding the
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
unknown fiscal impact of sb418 on the
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
state and local level
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note associated with the bill
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
states that an indeterminable increase
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
in expenditures would be needed in order
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
to fund the materials and labor needed
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
to implement this new system
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that these costs will come
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
cheap and these new resources would be
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
necessary for all future elections
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
given the potential harms of this bill
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
and the rarity of fraudulent voting it's
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
only fair that stakeholders are given a
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of the additional
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
costs sb418 would incur i ask that the
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee reconsider whether it's
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to invest these expenditures
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
and additional bureaucratic resources
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
into such drastic reforms
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
i strongly oppose sb418 and i urge all
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
committee members to vote against its
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
passage this bill takes drastic steps to
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
complicate election administration and
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
delay vote counting creates unnecessary
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
difficulties for countless voters and
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
has have
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
and as others have stated particularly
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
marginalizes our overseas military
 
01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:58.790 align:start position:0%
marginalizes our overseas military
voters

01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
if this committee is truly concerned
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
with election irregularities members
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
ought to consider strategies that
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
streamline and modernize the voting
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
process like enrolling in the electronic
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
registration information center
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
and implementing an online voter
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
information portal instead of enacting
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
more burdensome expensive and punitive
 
01:48:14.159 --> 01:48:15.350 align:start position:0%
more burdensome expensive and punitive
legislation

01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters election officials
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%

01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
today to substitute so we're going to
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
put him to work
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just in being on my right we're on
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're both on the judiciary committee so
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
i'm representing timothy horrigan i
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
represent strafford county district six
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
the towns of durham and madbury
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
the uh just
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
on my
 
01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:36.870 align:start position:0%
on my
first

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
my primary objection sb14 my first one
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
is that it's extraordinarily complicated
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
and error prone i um one of the things
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm on the back side of my written
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
testimony is a letter that was published
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the union leader yesterday where i
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
described as a rube goldberg scheme
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
actually unfair to rube goldberg because
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
his machines actually worked i don't
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
think this game outlined in the bill is
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
going to work um
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
although since i've um
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
and even i
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
on further reflection after sitting here
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
i realized uh first of all the number of
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
people going to be filling out these
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
ballots is going to be pretty small
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
because the number of people actually
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
show up with
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
no id and who aren't known to any of the
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
poll workers is vanishingly small i've
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
um i worked in a municipal election i
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
didn't see a single i worked in the
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
municipal election in march and i didn't
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
see a single
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
single person show up without id
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
although there are people who there are
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
citizens who for one reason other don't
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
have their id and still have the right
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
to vote though so
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that could be especially tragic
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
given what happened two years ago in the
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
presidential election and you probably
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't want me to go into that but um any
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
complication we have is one less thing
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
for p to be suspicious about when they
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't like the way the election turned
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
out and
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
let's keep them as simple secure and
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
error free as possible so putting in
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
this thing which is complicated
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
error-prone and
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
laughably insecure is a bad idea um
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
suther said it grossly compromises the
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
secrecy of the ballot
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
slows down the count for 14 days and
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
some cases we might never have a result
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
that everybody
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
accepts and that'd be especially tragic
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
happened during our state primary which
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
is only eight weeks before the general
 
01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
election and
 
01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.830 align:start position:0%
election and
[Music]

01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
of course it would be possible to change
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
the primary date i'm i've mixed feelings
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
about it and you do have another bill on
 
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:24.629 align:start position:0%
about it and you do have another bill on
it

01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
but sb 418 makes no provision for it
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
in fact it could in theory be passed and
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
take effect this year just weeks or even
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
days before the next primary in
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
september 13 2022 i mean it could
 
01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:37.990 align:start position:0%
september 13 2022 i mean it could
um

01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you know it could could even
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
happen like the week before although
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
that would have to involve
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
the bill passing and then being vetoed
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
and then for some reason being
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
overwritten which would mean that the
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
party i belong to the democrats would
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
have to all flip their votes but
 
01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.669 align:start position:0%
have to all flip their votes but
um

01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know passing this thing on passage
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the middle of an election
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
season is extremely foolhardy and um the
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
schemes beers have been hastily cooked
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
up by a handful of senators
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
as far as you can tell with no out input
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
from elections officials certainly we've
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
heard from several election officials
 
01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.229 align:start position:0%
heard from several election officials
who

01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
think this is a terrible idea
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
certainly without any field testing
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
although i have to confess i'm not
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
really sure of any way to field test
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
01:52:21.599 --> 01:52:22.470 align:start position:0%
something like this
um

01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
aside possibly from using it during
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
municipal elections although even then
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
municipal actions are quite different
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
from our
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
state elections another possibility of
 
01:52:31.679 --> 01:52:32.870 align:start position:0%
state elections another possibility of
course

01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
we could just field test this during the
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
2026 presidential primary but um i don't
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
think anybody wants
 
01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:40.629 align:start position:0%
think anybody wants
a

01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think the sponsors certainly don't
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
want to wait that long and i don't think
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
the last thing anybody wants to do when
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
presidential primary which will be which
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
is often a very close election is to
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
have this complicated thing that's going
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
to delay the final result but for two
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
weeks so the
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
and also add in the findings they seem
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be worried about multi-voting this
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
apps does absolutely nothing to prevent
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
multi-voting as long as a person shows
 
01:53:03.599 --> 01:53:05.189 align:start position:0%
multi-voting as long as a person shows
up

01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
shows up in one state with the popular
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
id and shows with another another state
 
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:09.669 align:start position:0%
id and shows with another another state
being

01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts as in the example i'm
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
passing around or in new jersey is in
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
the case of a
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
something that's been in the news lately
 
01:53:16.639 --> 01:53:17.589 align:start position:0%
something that's been in the news lately
um

01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
does absolutely nothing but to um
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
nothing about that but since some they
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to fill out this affidavit
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or in the other state
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
where the person is voting so it doesn't
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
even solve the problem it's worrying
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
about which is any case is a rather
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
um small problem so i think the
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
best thing to do with this bill is just
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
kill it like let's not pursue it any
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
further you know
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
horrigan are there any questions for
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anything and thank you
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
for all of the copies of your written
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
testimony yes i added all the way around
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
although i apologize um i i was using
 
01:53:54.639 --> 01:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
although i apologize um i i was using
the

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:56.310 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
i was using the old smoking room and i
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out how to print it on
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i noticed uh you have been using
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
apparently you've been using that same
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
thing before you may or may not be able
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
to print something so i tried
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
sending it upstairs and then a new

unfounded

01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
unfounded
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
arguments that are stirring up fear
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
regarding cost whether it's legal or not

regarding cost whether it's legal or not
and

01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
potential logistical nightmares
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe and i hope all of you
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
believe that there should be no cost
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
no threshold that should be put on
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that our elections are valid
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
and that only
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
the logistical nightmare arguments that
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
it will take extra time to vote
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
that's only if people don't bring their
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
photo id
 
01:55:48.639 --> 01:55:49.669 align:start position:0%
photo id
adults

adults
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
are the only people who can vote
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
based on the voting age
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
and they need to take personal
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
i live in windham
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
i heard one reference before about the
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
the nightmares that might
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
ensue with long lines
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
i know two of the supervisors of the
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
checklist very personally they're my
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
friends they are frustrated with the
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
ability of people to vote
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
with literally being able to sign a
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
piece of paper with no
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
proof of who they are
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
where they live or whether they're a u.s
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
citizen or not
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
i've served
 
01:56:31.199 --> 01:56:32.629 align:start position:0%
i've served
during

01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
election day to sign up
 
01:56:35.119 --> 01:56:36.310 align:start position:0%
election day to sign up
voters

01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
and it's really a mockery of our system
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
how easy it is for anyone to come in and
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
vote on election day
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
gave a lot of consideration in time to
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
address all the issues that have been
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
brought up in the past and senator gaida
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
and others including former chief
 
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.750 align:start position:0%
and others including former chief
justice

01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%

bob lynn
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
chief justice of the new hampshire
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%

01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
he supports this bill
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
and he does not believe
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
that there will be any issues regarding
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's exemption if passed
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
i spoke with him a few minutes ago when
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
he was sitting back here he had to leave
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
he gave me permission to make those
 
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:19.430 align:start position:0%
he gave me permission to make those
statements

01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
you need a license to get on a plane you
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
need a license to buy alcohol
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that people be able to
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
do these activities
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
by simply signing an affidavit without
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
proving who they are
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
i would hope not
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
the integrity of our elections as
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
everybody knows after 2020 is important
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%

opposition to sb 418
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%

this bill as currently written is
 
01:59:51.639 --> 01:59:53.270 align:start position:0%
this bill as currently written is
unconstitutional

01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
and is an unacceptable threat to the
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
right to vote of military members
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
stationed overseas
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the timeline
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
for uniformed and overseas citizens
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
absentee voting act ballots for active

military members
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
is already tight
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
sb 418 would make it nearly impossible
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
for service members stationed overseas
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%

time
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
one of us is a registered republican
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
the others tend to vote democratic
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
the right to vote transcends partisan
 
02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
the right to vote transcends partisan
politics

02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
politics
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
while serving in the u.s military we
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
relied on absentee ballots to
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
participate in the democratic process
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
during our many years of service
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
today as veterans we stand united in
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
support for the right to vote
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
current service members deserve better
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
than to have their vote
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
their right to vote taken away
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
simply because they are stationed
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
overseas protecting our country
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
frankly it is outrageous and a breach of
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
faith that the new hampshire legislature
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
would seek to enact a law that in any
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
way shape or form
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
restricts impedes or denies a service
 
02:01:37.599 --> 02:01:38.629 align:start position:0%
restricts impedes or denies a service
member's

02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
member's
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
right to participate in the most basic
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
of constitutionally
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
provided rights
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
we urge you to vote no on sb 418
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
to protect the right of our military and
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you for
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
your testimony it's there if
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative terozian has a question
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
if you'll indulge us
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you can turn your
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
mic back on
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you madam chan
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am for taking the question
 
02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.629 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am for taking the question
um

02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
could you point out in the proposed
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um where it
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh would infringe on the military from
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
exercising the right to vote
 
02:02:28.589 --> 02:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i could not point that out
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
specifically i must say i came here to
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
read this
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
on behalf of other people and i'm sure
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
they could point it out to you
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately i cannot answer you
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
directly could i call on someone to
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
because i do know someone who else who
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
um i think that's i'll set we'll wait
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
for somebody to say it in future
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank you thank you i
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
think it probably has something to do
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%

02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%

my name is daniel healey i am the derry
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
town clerk
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm here on behalf of the new
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire city and town clerks
 
02:03:35.679 --> 02:03:37.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire city and town clerks
association

02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
where he served as co-chair of our
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and his second
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
vice president of the association
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to offer our opposition to
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
sb 418
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
as it is a solution to a problem that
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
does not really exist
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
and ends up creating additional issues
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
if a resident comes to my town office
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
and registers to vote prior to an
 
02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.790 align:start position:0%
and registers to vote prior to an
election

02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
before the checklist is closed
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can register with affidavits and
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
have their name added to the checklist
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
on election day when they come in to
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
vote they would not be getting an
 
02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.229 align:start position:0%
vote they would not be getting an
affidavit

02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
yet they registered with affidavits
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
there is also currently no follow up
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
with voters that register at the town
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
office for additional proof of
 
02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:23.589 align:start position:0%
office for additional proof of
verification

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
verification
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
when they use an affidavit but new
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
registrants on election day
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
will need to provide proof
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
we are now treating voters differently
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
if they cannot make it to the town
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
office prior to an election
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
i also question how many voters that
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
register on election day who end up
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
following through with sending the
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork in on time
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
as it needs to be received by the
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
secretary of state within 10 days
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
mail sometimes is delayed for various
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
reasons and this could cause many
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate votes to be negated to
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
counter the rare occurrence of an
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
illegally cast ballot
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of affidavit
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
ballots used or lack of voter privacy
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
could become an issue
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
if we only have one voter that needs
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
this type of ballot everyone will know
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
exactly how they voted and that is a
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
major issue
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was written if a person
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
does not send in the paperwork their
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
vote for that election will not count
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
but they will still be added to the
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
checklist for future elections
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
for the previously stated reasons i
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
would recommend this committee to itl
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%

welcome

02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%

um chairman griffin and the committee
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
members my name is gail laker phelps and
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm from chichester
 
02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.750 align:start position:0%
i'm from chichester
um

02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to give my
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
personal opinion on this bill
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
i feel that this bill would support an
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
environment that would separate one vote
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
from another which i think violates
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
citizens right to a secret and
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
unidentifiable ballot
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
to creating more complexities to our
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
election process
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
and more expense
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
this bill also endangers the
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
legitimately cast votes of citizens
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
serving overseas in our military this is
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
unconscionable and unnecessary
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think the whole thing is unnecessary
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
um sb 418
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
would take new hampshire down the
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
slippery slope of voter suppression by
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
enabling the invalidation of votes cast
 
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
in good
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
faith i think that's a big concern
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm worried that we are going down the
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
path of states like georgia and texas
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
let's keep new hampshire free
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
of interference with a citizen's right
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
to cast a secret ballot
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
so please uh vote against this bill
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
sb 418 thank you
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%

02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%

02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%

02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
i come from a family that's often served
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the u.s military
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
i myself was in the u.s navy in a
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
helicopter combat support squadron
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
during the vietnam war
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
i also serve in the american legion for
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
more than 20 years
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm currently the service officer for
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
post 88 in loudoun
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
i have seven cousins who served in the
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
korean war
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
a brother-in-law and two cousins who
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
served in vietnam
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
and several nephews who served in kuwait
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
and iraq
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
i believe the vote the right to vote is
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most important right we have
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
as a democratic society
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
why would anyone vote for a bill that
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
makes it harder for military people who
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
are serving our country
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
and securing our right to vote
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
to have trouble getting their own votes
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard enough to vote when you're
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
when you're serving we need not make it
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
more difficult or even impossible to
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
exercise their vote
 
02:08:43.199 --> 02:08:45.510 align:start position:0%
exercise their vote
themselves

02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
the delay caused by the additional
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
administrative process this bill creates
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
to voter registration
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
can delay getting ballots to a service
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
men and women serving around the world
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
and would impede their ability to
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
exercise the very right to vote for
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
which they're fighting
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
it is our military who have secured and
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
maintained our voting rights since the
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war was 250 years ago
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
i think those who followed us in serving
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
their country should not find it more
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to exercise the very rights a
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
service has secured for all americans
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
urgent to defeat sb 418 and to protect
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the voting rights of military personnel
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
wherever in the world they may be called
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%

02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
the honorable bob perry has signed up to

02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%

02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
my presentation will bob perry town of
 
02:10:15.679 --> 02:10:17.510 align:start position:0%
my presentation will bob perry town of
stratford

02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
my presentation will focus on the
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph at roman one
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
among other thoughts
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
i have a personal interest in the
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
mention of the 1974 u.s senate campaign
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
having worked with judge wyman in the
 
02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:36.069 align:start position:0%
having worked with judge wyman in the
1980s

02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
i could not find and i'm leaving out a
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph about that i could not find
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
the specific reference to the incident
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
involving the 500 fine
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
involving double voting in massachusetts
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
and plymouth new hampshire
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
however even without the details i will
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
assume the fine was commensurate with
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
the crime
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
and i am grateful that as of today in
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
america prosecutors and judges still
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
have discretion in punishing and
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
because the ag was unable to verify the
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
identity of certain voters no inference
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
can be drawn there from
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
thus cannot be used as justification for
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
once again i am grateful that as of
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
today in america the accused are
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
the governor has gone beyond rejecting
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
the unfounded claims of massive voter
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
fraud made by the former president
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
instead he has praised the integrity of
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire vote on multiple
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
occasions including his formal
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
post-election statement made
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
december 2nd 2020 which reads as follows
 
02:11:44.159 --> 02:11:45.669 align:start position:0%
december 2nd 2020 which reads as follows

secure accurate and reliable there is no
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
question about it
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
i think i thank
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
bill gartner our town moderators and
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
clerks and all local election officials
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
for delivering results to the people of
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
timely and accurately just as they have
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
always done end quote
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll skip a couple of paragraphs
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
and most recently the governor reprised
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
his prior remarks during an interview at
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
wmur saying in part quote our citizens
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
believe in our system that it does have
 
02:12:25.599 --> 02:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
believe in our system that it does have
integrity

02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
99 of the folks polled say that they
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
know that the system works very very
 
02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
know that the system works very very
well

02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that's really where we need to be
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
if the governor is correct that there is
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
99 trust in new hampshire elections why
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
are we here today further regulating the
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
franchise with this bill
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
i suggest this bill or any other will
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
not fix the one percent that remains
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
because no legislation will produce that
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
level of purity or perfection and we
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
will never know how many people will
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
decide not to vote
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
after hearing about the complexities of
 
02:13:00.719 --> 02:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
after hearing about the complexities of
418.

02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
418.
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
conclusions based on extensive research
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
have demonstrated repeatedly that only a
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
tiny percentage of miscast votes
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
involve malice or criminal intent
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that tiny percentage
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
must not be used to punish voters and
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
impose greater responsibilities
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
on poll workers
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
finding volunteers to work elections
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
becomes more difficult and demanding
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
with every new election cycle every new
 
02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
law every new headline and every new
 
02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
law every new headline and every new
threat

02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
threat
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
to election workers this bill will
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problem
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
do i have time madam chair to continue
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
with my last paragraph i yes you do
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
i will finish with this
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
on a happy note let's commit to
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%

02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%

health and security of home and family i
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintain in this political environment
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
it is important to move
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
to the global community and it's lean
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%

i live in cornish and i have for 43
 
02:15:08.159 --> 02:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
i live in cornish and i have for 43
years

02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
i drove one and a half hours to be here
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
this morning because i believe
 
02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
our elections in new hampshire are fair
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
just as they are
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
i worry that the many voter bills have
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
been written intentionally to cast doubt
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
on the integrity of our elections in new
 
02:15:30.079 --> 02:15:32.149 align:start position:0%
on the integrity of our elections in new
hampshire

02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
in so many cases on other bills you
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
oppose i have heard you imply that if it
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
ain't broke
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't fix it
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
but sb 418
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
gives the impression
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
that there is something wrong with our
 
02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:48.830 align:start position:0%
that there is something wrong with our
voting

02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
system i heard the author of this bill
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
stand up and say just the opposite
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
and the senators who voted alongside him
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
reinforced that idea
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
i worked at the polls and saw some of my
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
neighbors who forgot their id or didn't
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
have a driver's license and they started
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
to walk away
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the sister of one voter of and his
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
her brother was a vietnam
 
02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.589 align:start position:0%
her brother was a vietnam
veteran

02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
he had some drinking plot problems due
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
to ptsd and lost his license
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
i said just have him bring proof of
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
being a resident like a utility bill
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
better yet have him go over and talk to
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
they will help him
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
i mean the election officials knew him
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
he could fill out an affidavit
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
to one woman i said
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
you can fill out an affidavit don't go
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
because she was heading out the door
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
she said i'm a republican why would you
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
help me
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
she knew me
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
and many in town know me
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
i said that all votes count
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what party you come
 
02:17:06.399 --> 02:17:07.830 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what party you come
from

02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
but now
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%

02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%

general for further investigation this
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
bill makes demands on eligible voters
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that all of them will be able to fulfill
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%

to serve in the medical corps united
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%

02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%

02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
army one of my brothers served in
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
vietnam another in korea
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
my dad was a naval officer in the
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
pacific during world war ii and several
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
uncles served our country from the
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
beaches of normandy to guadalcanal
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the legislative legislative session
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
which featured an array of galactically
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
inane bills targeting public health
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights and public schools
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
sb 418 is put forth as a fix to a new
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire voting process which is
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
clearly not broken or engulfed in fraud
 
02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
i would just highlight the effect that
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
this voter suppression bill might have
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
upon active duty military men and women
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
who may be deployed in service of our
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
constitution and country
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
there exists the very real possibility
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the processing of their votes may
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
be delayed by the enactment of sb 418
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
and perhaps not counted on behalf of our
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
service men and women new americans and
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
those perhaps trying to exercise their
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote for the
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
first time i say that this bill is a
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
travesty i vehemently oppose this bill
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
and believe that its authors should be
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
ashamed for their thinly guised effort
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
to manipulate election results
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%

welcome
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chairwoman and
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
members of the house election law
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
committee my name is matt mushian i live
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
in claremont where i serve as a city
 
02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:52.710 align:start position:0%
in claremont where i serve as a city
councilor

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
councilor
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
i also work with 603 ford a non-partisan
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
organization dedicated to
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
educating activating and empowering
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
young people in our state
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm here today to testify
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
in opposition to senate bill 418.
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
this bill creates confusion and
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
complicates our voting process which
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
will disproportionately burden the right
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
to vote for working age
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
and military voters who are also
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
predominantly younger
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why i urge the committee to
 
02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
vote in expediting the legislate on
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418.
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
first and foremost this bill does
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to improve our elections and
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's rooted in conspiracy theories that
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
only serve to weaken faith in our
 
02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
only serve to weaken faith in our
elections

02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
in 2020 50
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
of working age voters aged 18 to 29
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
participated in the democratic process
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
and voted in the election
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418 seeks to only make it
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
harder for working age voters to
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
participate in the process by making
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
same-day voter registration
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
more difficult and burdensome
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
further this bill creates a provisional
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
ballot system for those registering to
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
vote for the first time on election day
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
which is again something that a lot of
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
young folks do if they've moved here for
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
work or for school
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
by implementing
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
this provisional ballot system as a
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
means to track someone's vote there are
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
also serious threats to ballot privacy
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
and security because
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
these provisional ballots would have a
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
unique number or identifier connecting
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
them to the name of a ballot at the name
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
of a voter meaning that in a small town
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
or a city like claremont your community
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
members who are working at the polls
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
could know who you voted for
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
also as this bill currently stands it
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
violates federal law that the uniformed
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
and overseas citizens absentee voting
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
act making it harder for military
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
members their families and other united
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
states citizens living out of the
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
country to vote
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
i have friends and family who have
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
served overseas and some currently do
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
and their service to our country should
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
be honored in the most basic possible
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
way by protecting their right to vote
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
and making sure that they are included
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
in our democracy no matter where they
 
02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:11.670 align:start position:0%
in our democracy no matter where they
are

02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
these are just
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of the barriers that this
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation creates for young people
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
exercising their constitutional right to
 
02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:18.790 align:start position:0%
exercising their constitutional right to
vote

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation creates unnecessary
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
confusion and complicates our voting
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
process as i said
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
and as a result voters may feel too
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
burdened to participate in the process
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
i've worked at my local polling location
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
before and i know that our election
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
officials work hard to keep our
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
elections safe and secure
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
and adding these additional needless and
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
confusing steps to our election day
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
operations will only burden local
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
election officials and confuse everyone
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
involved confusion leads to longer
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
alliance which are proven to
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise eligible voters
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
this body should be prioritizing making
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
it easier for people to participate in
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bedrock of our democracy free and
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
fair elections not creating unnecessary
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
burdens not so distrust in our elections
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
i ask you please devote an expedient to
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislate on senate bill 418 and i thank
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
you for your time and consideration
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming this afternoon any
 
02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:17.349 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming this afternoon any
questions

02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is kate

horgan i'm from the dupont group and
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
today i'm representing secure democracy
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
who is a non-partisan non-profit group
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
that is focused on voter integrity and
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
voter access they have extreme concerns
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
and you've had a lot of great speakers
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i will be very brief uh around the
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
ukava ballots just to walk through what
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
the process is so if this bill were in
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
place for this year
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh the ballots would have to go out 45
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
days before
 
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
the general election that would be
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
september 24th
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
this year the
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
primary is on the 13th
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots wouldn't be finalized
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
until september 23rd and then the
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would have 14 days
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
after that primary meaning september
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
27th to finalize the elections i have
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
great faith in our secretary of state
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
however i do not know how if he's not
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
done until september 27th he can make
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
that uh september 24th deadline so we
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring that to the
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee's attention
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions that the
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
i submitted written testimony which
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
details in our view
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
the numerous legal problems with this
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill but in the interest of brevity i
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
thought i would just focus on two
 
02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
the first concerns the documentary proof
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
of citizenship requirement
 
02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:40.230 align:start position:0%
of citizenship requirement
so

02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
under this bill if a person registering
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
to vote for the first time on election
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
day does not have proof of citizenship
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
they'd be allowed to sign an affidavit
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
of then would have 10 days to provide
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship to the secretary of
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
state's office before their or their
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
ballot would be
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
uncounted uh for most people who are
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
natural born citizens the only proof of
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
citizenship that exists is a u.s
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
passport or a birth certificate a
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
passport book costs 110 and takes 10 to
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
12 weeks to get
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
and a birth certificate depends uh
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
depending on the municipality of bert so
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
for an american born abroad to us
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
parents they need to send a notarized
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
request to the united states state
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
department and fifty dollars for someone
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
who's born in hawaii takes you know
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
probably five days to get mail to and
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
from hawaii so probably wouldn't have
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
time to get a birth certificate from
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
hawaii and submit it to the united uh to
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state to have their
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
vote counted um and the fact that it's
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
so hard to prove citizenship is probably
 
02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:42.710 align:start position:0%
so hard to prove citizenship is probably
why

02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the 10th circuit in a case
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
called fish versus schwab ruled as
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional kansas's similar effort
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
to require proof of documentary proof of
 
02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
to require proof of documentary proof of
citizenship

02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
to those who would vote the court
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
concluded in some we conclude that the
 
02:27:58.560 --> 02:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
concluded in some we conclude that the
documentary

02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
documentary
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship requirement is
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and uphold the district
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
court's injunction that decision was
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
affirmed when the u.s supreme court in
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
2020 declined to review it
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
just so we know how many people were
 
02:28:13.389 --> 02:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
talking about in
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
2020 um
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the general election 816 people in
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire used the qualify the
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavit to prove
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
citizenship so probably about that
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
number of people would be in danger of
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
having their votes discounted
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
if they did not return with the said
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
with a passport or a birth certificate
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
within 10 days
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
the process by which the moderators
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
would know how everyone who votes who
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
casts an absentee ballot
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
in my view violates the newest part of
 
02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution enacted
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
by the voters in 2018 which is part 1
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
article 2b
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
which provides an individual's right to
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
and private or personal information is
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
my view and the view of the aclu of new
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that the way that a person
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
voted is exactly the type
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
of private or personal information that
 
02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
the electorate thought they were
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
enshrining constitutional protections
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
against governmental intrusion from
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
so um i think there's a number of issues
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill you've heard people talk
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
about you acaba you've heard people talk
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
about the the court decision from sp3 um
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions from the
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
committee but i did just want to uplift
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
i sent
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
late last evening a letter from the
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to the
 
02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to the
committee

02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
indicating that
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
they do not have any criminal or civil
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement proceedings pending in
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
relation to wrongful voting stemming
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
from the september 8th 2020 or november
 
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
3rd 2020 elections
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
nor have they instituted any criminal or
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
civil enforcement proceedings at all
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
they had opened 23 investigations and 18
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
of those have been satisfactorily
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
resolved so there's five pending
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
investigations no even allegations
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
criminal or civil that anyone committed
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
any type of voter fraud in the 2020
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
elections so that's the type of state
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
interest that the state would have to
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
contend with in defending this law in
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
court the fact that the attorney
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
general's office has found no cases of
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
wrongful voting so i'm happy to take any
 
02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:16.710 align:start position:0%
wrongful voting so i'm happy to take any
questions

02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
if there
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you do committee members have any
 
02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:21.429 align:start position:0%
thank you do committee members have any
questions

02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you also
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
hello again madam chair members of the
 
02:30:41.190 --> 02:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is michael o'brien i
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
am with pretty strategies here today
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
representing america votes in opposition
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot already about some of
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
the points that i was going to make so
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to skip over those and just
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
talk about a couple of
 
02:30:51.439 --> 02:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
talk about a couple of
instances

02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
instances
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
of concern for me
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
so under this bill it specifies that a
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
first time
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
registrant in new hampshire would be the
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
one to fall under
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
sb 418 and the affidavit ballot however
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
it does not give any
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
example of how you would define or
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
figure out how a person is a first-time
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voter certainly on the
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
voter registration form we ask where
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
their previous registration was
 
02:31:16.950 --> 02:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that form i suppose you could take
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
that voter at their word
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
and trust that they are in fact have
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
been registered in new hampshire before
 
02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:23.830 align:start position:0%
been registered in new hampshire before
um

02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
but under this bill we are already
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
saying to people that we're not going to
 
02:31:28.150 --> 02:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
take them at their word for filling out
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
a form so that seems a little
 
02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
contradictory to begin with but secondly
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
what about the voter who voted
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
registered in new hampshire voted left
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
and now has come back their last
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
known voter registration may be in
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts maybe
 
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
in hawaii maybe anywhere
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
that was not new hampshire how do we
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
figure out if that voter has in fact
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
registered in new hampshire before are
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
we going to ask them if we ask them when
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
they tell us are we going to believe
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
them what if the voter is wrong
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
as often happens if you ask local
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
election officials someone will attest
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh that they in fact have registered to
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
vote before and when they go into the
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
voter file that person is not there
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
often that is because the person has
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
come from a motor voter state and
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
assumes when they get their driver's
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
license that they
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
have automatically qualified to register
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
to vote and that is not the case um does
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
that person has that person violated the
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
law anyway i think these are procedural
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions that are real that have not
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
been addressed
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
i also think when you look back to 2016
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the number of individuals
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
who pull the domicile affidavit you can
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
see that over six thousand of them
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
pulled it as has been stated before
 
02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
pulled it as has been stated before
um

02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
the so the sos secretary of state's
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
office was able to verify i think all
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
but 353 of those voters so i'm going to
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
be real generous here and say the sos
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
verified all but 353 within 10 days
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
right they get them all done within 10
 
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
right they get them all done within 10
days

02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
the ag wasn't able to verify all but 66
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
and again they're not saying that 66
 
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
people committed fraud but that leaves
 
02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
you with 290 voters
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
that basic maybe not quite but just
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
about whose ballots would have been
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
thrown away under this law and who were
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate voters found by the state to
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
be legitimate voters
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
that's the problem right we cannot be
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
should not be looking to throw away
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
legitimate votes and that would happen
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
under 418.
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
so in addition to all of the yokava
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have heard the privacy
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have heard um i just
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out two very specific
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
instances where this law runs into some
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
very serious trouble
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%

02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
418
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons uh that
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
others have mentioned
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
but in particular
 
02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:38.070 align:start position:0%
but in particular
the

02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
deadline if you are
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
military deployed overseas the dead time
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
deadline in new hampshire as has already
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
been mentioned
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh makes it extremely hard
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
get a ballot fill it out absentee ballot
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%

02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
let go of them at the moment
 
02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
let go of them at the moment
uh

02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%

hope i have that uh pronunciation right
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh is a
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
retired senior master sergeant uh in the

air force
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
22 years in the military
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
served overseas for 10 of those years
 
02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:54.790 align:start position:0%
served overseas for 10 of those years
and

02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:55.910 align:start position:0%
and
he

02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:57.030 align:start position:0%
he
uh

02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed the bill
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
he says he and everyone he served with
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh took their right to vote seriously
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
and did vote when they were able to
 
02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.710 align:start position:0%
and did vote when they were able to
uh

02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
and uh were aware of and discussed being
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
under uh more time constraints than
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
our right to vote is sacred and no
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
not no more so than for military members
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
who are fighting to preserve that right
 
02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:39.590 align:start position:0%
who are fighting to preserve that right
overseas

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill does not successfully define
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
the logistics of ensuring ballot access
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
for overseas military personnel
 
02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
making it near impossible for them to
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
get their ballots get them returned
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh in time to be
 
02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:58.150 align:start position:0%
uh in time to be
counted

02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
counted
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh quote this is unacceptable and
 
02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
uh quote this is unacceptable and
unconstitutional

02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
i am here to ask you to vote no on
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418 to protect the right to
 
02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:15.190 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418 to protect the right to
vote

02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:37:18.309 --> 02:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
to the military members of the military
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
members serving overseas
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
mr cacciati i've got to mention that is
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
from atkinson
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
the second letter
 
02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
the second letter
is

02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
from bob baker also an air force veteran
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
lives in columbia new hampshire
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
i strongly believe that no americans
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
should have to fight for the right to
 
02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
should have to fight for the right to
vote

02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
especially true for the brave men and
 
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
women in uniform serving overseas
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
our right to vote is sacred and no more
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
so than for
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
deployed military
 
02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:59.110 align:start position:0%
deployed military
he

02:37:59.110 --> 02:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
he obviously is against senate bill 418
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
which he says does not adequately
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
adequately protect the right to vote and
 
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
it makes it nearly impossible for
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
military personnel overseas
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
to get their ballots have them
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh returned on time and counted this is
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
an unconscionable violation of the right
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.270 align:start position:0%
to vote
when

02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:30.469 align:start position:0%
when
and

02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
quoting again when i served overseas
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
during the vietnam war i always tried to
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
vote sometimes the duty mission
 
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
prevented it i always felt badly about
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
missing the vote
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
please don't take away that voting right
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
from our new hampshire vets
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
or actually new new hampshire deployed
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
military is what he means obviously by
 
02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
setting up completely unnecessary
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the exercise of our most
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr magruder i you're way over
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
time but i know that you're reading
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
testimony from a couple of other people
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%

02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair h grace from the
 
02:39:40.389 --> 02:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
um we don't oppose efforts to ensure
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
voters provide proper identification and
 
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
documentation but we are concerned about
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
the process set up by this bill you've
 
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
already heard from a number of municipal
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
officials today i won't reiterate
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
anything that they said um suffice to
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
say they they
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard the same concerns
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
at nhma
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
um the only additional uh thing i'd like
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
to add is that
 
02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
one concern that that came to our
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
attention was
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
um from those officials who
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh election officials who stand next to
 
02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh election officials who stand next to
the

02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
ballot counting device there was a
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
concern from a number of municipalities
 
02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
concern from a number of municipalities
that

02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know they would have to engage in a
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
dialogue with a voter other than
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
put in your ballot any way you want
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
because these the process set up by this
 
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill would require the voter after
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
voting to put the
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
the affidavit ballot into a side pocket
 
02:40:37.439 --> 02:40:39.110 align:start position:0%
the affidavit ballot into a side pocket
obviously

02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
that could result in some
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
confident confrontation depending on how
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
the voter takes that and how they
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of work
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to prolong this hearing any
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
longer than necessary so i'm happy to
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
take any questions that committee has
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you

thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're a non-partisan organization
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
whose mission is to empower voters
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
and we do that in many ways one of them
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
is to prepare brochures
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
that are distributed it's it's online
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're distributed at all sorts of places
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
and to all sorts of groups we also do
 
02:41:54.479 --> 02:41:56.790 align:start position:0%
and to all sorts of groups we also do
presentations

02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
about the voting process
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
and about two months ago i was talking
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
to a group of people called the granite
 
02:42:05.359 --> 02:42:06.469 align:start position:0%
to a group of people called the granite
leaders

02:42:06.469 --> 02:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
leaders
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
these are formerly homeless people
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
who are being taught to find their civic
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
voices and use it to advocate for those
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
who are still homeless
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
and they had lots of questions about
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
voting as you can imagine
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
they were very surprised with when i
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
told them that you don't need a driver's
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
license to prove identity that you can
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
get a non-driver's id from the dmv and
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
we talked about that of course one of
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
them said so how do i get to the dmv
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
well you know good point we have to find
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
a better way to do that
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
but they want to vote
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
they may not have the documents that are
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
required in here
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
so i started looking at it from that
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
our documents that are our flyers and so
 
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
on that we produce are getting more and
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
more complicated every year
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
as the legislature passes one law after
 
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:13.590 align:start position:0%
as the legislature passes one law after
another

02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
trying to chase away that phantom of the
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
white vans from massachusetts bringing
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
up voters illegally on election day the
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
laws get more complicated
 
02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
not for you and me we understand what
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
these laws are
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
but for the average voter this threatens
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
to make those eligible voters not vote
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
so on the second page of my testimony
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
i admit i had a little fun
 
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
i tried to imagine what the document
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
would look like
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
that would be given to this person who
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
did not show up with a voter id for
 
02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:56.150 align:start position:0%
did not show up with a voter id for
instance

02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
instance
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
or did not have citizenship papers
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
now unlike sb3 where everything was
 
02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
spelled out and that was one of the
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
reasons it was defeated because the
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
language was way way way too confusing
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
i tried to imagine here
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
since it's not in the bill what the
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
language would look like so you see that
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the box on page two
 
02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:20.309 align:start position:0%
in the box on page two
and

02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
it might look something like this it's
 
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
not even complete i said here i expect
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
you'll put in this language that
 
02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:27.910 align:start position:0%
you'll put in this language that
language

02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
the point i am trying to make is
 
02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
the average person coming in to vote
 
02:44:37.429 --> 02:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
maybe for the first time maybe an 18
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
year old is simply not used to reading
 
02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:41.190 align:start position:0%
year old is simply not used to reading
this

02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
imagine being handed this by the
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist and saying
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
you've got 10 days to fill out this form
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
and get a copy of whatever is checked
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
off there and mail it back in this
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
envelope which by the way costs 27 and
 
02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
we don't know if it's the city town or
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then they walk out and they said but
 
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
i already voted
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
so why do i do this
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of confusion
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
is what we need to avoid in order to
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
restore the public's faith in elections
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think our faith has been
 
02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:22.469 align:start position:0%
i don't think our faith has been
destroyed

02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
destroyed
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
but it's teetering and the more
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
complicated the process gets the worse
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
for people to feel that they have the
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
power to exercise their right to vote
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to leave these brochures which
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
are dated 2021 but there's
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
still applicable we haven't changed the
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
law since then in case anybody wants to
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
pick one up on the way out so thank you
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%

02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.240 align:start position:0%

02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%

i thank you so much for giving me a
 
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:16.880 align:start position:0%

02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
it um i was born in plymouth grew up in
 
02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:21.110 align:start position:0%
it um i was born in plymouth grew up in
plymouth

02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
plymouth
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
i lived a year in concord i've lived
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
in belmont for the last 10 years but
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
i've always called new hampshire home
 
02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
with the exception of
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
2004-2005 when i was in iraq as a u.s
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
army infantryman
 
02:46:35.439 --> 02:46:36.790 align:start position:0%
army infantryman
that

02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
i voted absentee um
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i i wanted to make sure that i came
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
in to ask the committee to vote in
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
expedia to legislate on this
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
um in particular i know that that there
 
02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:48.870 align:start position:0%
um in particular i know that that there
are

02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
um provisions that suggest that you
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
could print out a ballot or do
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
online ballots
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
um the post when you're in a combat zone
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
is extremely unreliable can take a
 
02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
couple weeks i was lucky enough to be
 
02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
stationed on a major life support area
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
lsa anaconda um but for folks on forward
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
operating bases mail could take
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
several weeks to get get in and out
 
02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
so that the timeliness factor is
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
definitely important we had one printer
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
for our company i certainly was not
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to use it it was in the supply
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
sergeant's office and
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm so printing something off is not
 
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
possible internet access in particular
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
on forward operating bases can't happen
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so the timing here means that this
 
02:47:35.309 --> 02:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
would this would almost certainly uh
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise folks who are um in
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
combat zones and i just wanted to make
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
sure as somebody who has experienced
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
voting from a combat zone
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
um that that this bill really shouldn't
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
be something that we're looking at
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
seriously so thank you for your time
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
 
02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
thanks so much
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
i also have um someone from the
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%

state and i will say senator guide is
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
braver than i to be between the
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee and the cafeteria at this time
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
of day so yeah um
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'm here in in general support of senate
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
bill 418
 
02:49:16.479 --> 02:49:17.429 align:start position:0%
bill 418
uh

02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the efforts that senator guida has
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
undertaken with
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
along with uh others
 
02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:24.870 align:start position:0%
along with uh others
um

02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner and i had worked with
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
senator guida
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
last fall on on his ideas
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know he is addressing
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
an area that is probably the greatest
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
threat to our
 
02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:42.309 align:start position:0%
threat to our
elections

02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh moving forward and that is
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
a serious decline in voter confidence
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it in new hampshire but
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing it nationally
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's a number of reasons for that
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that we have to
 
02:49:58.309 --> 02:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
take steps
 
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the voters that
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
participate in new hampshire elections
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
feel that the elections are
 
02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:07.269 align:start position:0%
feel that the elections are
fair

02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
fair
 
02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
their votes are being accurately counted
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that those individuals that are
 
02:50:13.429 --> 02:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
participating in the election are
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
qualified to participate
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill attempts to
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
get at
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
our system in new hampshire is based on
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
a series a set of checks and balances
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
we see it in the polling place by the
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
elected locally elected officials that
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
work there
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
we also see
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
partisan participation in the fact that
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
the political parties get to submit
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
names for individuals to serve as ballot
 
02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:41.030 align:start position:0%
names for individuals to serve as ballot
clerks

02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
and also individuals that can serve as
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
and in the voting process itself there
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
is a natural tension that exists between
 
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
ease of voting
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
and making sure that those individuals
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
that are voting are qualified to vote
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i will say and i think everybody in
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
this room should agree that it is
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
extremely easy to vote in new hampshire
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that if we're not the
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
easiest state to participate in an
 
02:51:14.950 --> 02:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
election we're pretty darn close
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing although it hasn't
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
been reflected in testimony today
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
that there is a growing sense in many
 
02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
that there is a growing sense in many
voters

02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
problems with the election that there is
 
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent voting that takes place or it
 
02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
is easy to allow that happen
 
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
and they believe that even if it's just
 
02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
a perception you know they believe that
 
02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:41.349 align:start position:0%
a perception you know they believe that
perception

02:51:41.349 --> 02:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
perception
 
02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know i will say very openly and
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
clearly i don't agree with that position
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
voting in new hampshire is fair i
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
believe the results are accurate
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
there are isolated instances of
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
inappropriate voting and the attorney
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
general's office has made prosecutions
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
along those lines in recent years
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
but there is nothing that appears to be
 
02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
so that gets back to senator guida's
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
bill senate bill 418
 
02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
and it it tries to address
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
the security side of the voting process
 
02:52:26.630 --> 02:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
trying to take some steps
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
that will let
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
other voters see
 
02:52:30.399 --> 02:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
other voters see
that

02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
those that are participating in the
 
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
election are qualified
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is not the end-all there's many
 
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
other things that we have to do and
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
as the secretary of state we have plans
 
02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:44.710 align:start position:0%
as the secretary of state we have plans
this

02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
summer and fall
 
02:52:46.399 --> 02:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
summer and fall
to

02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
be very visible we want to have an open
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about these issues
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
we want to do a lot more related to
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
voter education on the on this process
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
of voting
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we're also going to do a lot more
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
work with local election officials
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
on training uh
 
02:53:09.910 --> 02:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on transparency this process
 
02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
has to be as transparent as we can make
 
02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:13.030 align:start position:0%
has to be as transparent as we can make
it

02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
and while i generally support the
 
02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
and while i generally support the
efforts

02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are constitutional
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be addressed
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
um i i would like to see this bill
 
02:53:31.510 --> 02:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
amended you know to address
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
some of the other concerns that have
 
02:53:34.230 --> 02:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
been mentioned
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
but there is a tool the legislature has
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
to lay a bill like this on the table
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
send a resolution to the supreme court
 
02:53:43.110 --> 02:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
and ask them for
 
02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:44.230 align:start position:0%
and ask them for
an

02:53:44.230 --> 02:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
advisory opinion on those questions
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they would like to ask and some of
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
those uh you know i would start off
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
by asking if part two article 32 of the
 
02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:58.070 align:start position:0%
by asking if part two article 32 of the
constitution

02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
requires that all ballots
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
that are cast in an election
 
02:54:06.870 --> 02:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
be counted with the results declared
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
in one continuous meeting in other words
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know when the polls close
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
do all the results have to be
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
accounted for at that time
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
or is there any scenario where vote
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
tallies from ballots not counted on the
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
day the election
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
can be added to the declared results
 
02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
announced on election day
 
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that's a question directly related
 
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
to provisional ballots
 
02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
which is something by the way that is
 
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
used in just about every other state in
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
the country new hampshire is unique
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
in that all ballots are cast in election
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
are counted on the day of the election
 
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
and there is no provisional ballot
 
02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:45.830 align:start position:0%
and there is no provisional ballot
process

02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
similarly is there any scenario where
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
vote tallies can be subtracted from the
 
02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
declaration of results after the
 
02:54:52.479 --> 02:54:53.750 align:start position:0%
declaration of results after the
election

02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
that were counted on the day the
 
02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:56.070 align:start position:0%
that were counted on the day the
election

02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
and that is specific to this novel
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
version of a provisional ballot where
 
02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
as it's called an affidavit ballot in
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
the bill would be counted on the day of
 
02:55:07.349 --> 02:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
the election
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
but if the voter did not respond to the
 
02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
request for
 
02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:14.830 align:start position:0%
request for
uh

02:55:14.830 --> 02:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
documentation then their the votes on
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
their ballot would be
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
discounted from
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
the election some days after took place
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then does providing
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
does requiring a voter to provide
 
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
documentation qualifications
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
after having voted on the daily election
 
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
constitute a burden as was determined by
 
02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
there is also the question that was
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
raised today about uh the uocaba ballots
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and those absentee ballots that are sent
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
to our military
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
and overseas personnel
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that there is no desire
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
on my part or the part of
 
02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office to
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
not meet that 45-day deadline and in
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
fact if we did not uh meet it then
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh the u.s department of justice would
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
be all over us in in very short order
 
02:56:11.910 --> 02:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
and certainly that's an experience that
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
none of us want
 
02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:15.190 align:start position:0%
none of us want
um

02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know there are ways to deal with
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
that time frame you know you could
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
shorten it up and give a voter fewer
 
02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:21.750 align:start position:0%
shorten it up and give a voter fewer
days

02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:22.550 align:start position:0%
days
to

02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
comply with a request for documentation
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's a pending bill before the
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
legislature to move the date of the
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
state primary
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh although i'm not advocating for that
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
my position is that
 
02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:38.309 align:start position:0%
my position is that
the

02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
state primary is fine just the way it is
 
02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:42.070 align:start position:0%
state primary is fine just the way it is
um

02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
i will stop there madam chair uh and i
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
will be happy to answer any questions
 
02:56:49.830 --> 02:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions for secretary scanlon
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:56:55.349 --> 02:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlon um
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
a small constitutional question 28a
 
02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
an earlier speaker said that there were
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
about 6 000 affidavits used in the 2016
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
election i thought it was closer to
 
02:57:08.950 --> 02:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
7 500 but be that as it may the postage
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
cost for that many affidavits would then
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
run between 160 000 to 200 and 2 000 and
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure would have to be more because
 
02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
the polling sites would have to have
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
more envelopes than they would possibly
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
need uh there's no fiscal note in this
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say who's going to be
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for those exorbitant postage
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
prices is it your intent that this is
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to be taken up by the secretary of
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
state you're going to write it out of
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
your budget
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding the way i read
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is that the secretary of state
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
is supposed to provide
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
the packets that would be issued to a
 
02:57:39.439 --> 02:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
the packets that would be issued to a
voter

02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:57:43.349 --> 02:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
that was voting by an affidavit ballot
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
with prepaid
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
overnight postage
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
on those documents
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're working on refining the fiscal
 
02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
note in fact i think patty lovejoy has
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
been working on that
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know we should have a
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
figure for you that is uh been hundreds
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars okay thank you
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead thank you madam
 
02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you mr secretary
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
um i have a uh two two quick questions
 
02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:13.990 align:start position:0%
um i have a uh two two quick questions
please

02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
one is uh some earlier witnesses
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
testified that they were concerned that
 
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
this passage of this bill might cause
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
the state to lose its exemption
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the national voter registration act
 
02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
and putting to the side the prediction
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
of whether that might happen would
 
02:58:31.830 --> 02:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
anything important to new hampshire
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
citizens be lost
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
if the state were to lose its exemption
 
02:58:38.950 --> 02:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the national voter registration act
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
we have developed a unique election
 
02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
process over time that works incredibly
 
02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:44.389 align:start position:0%
process over time that works incredibly
well

02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:58:46.469 --> 02:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
i would not want to see us lose our
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
exemption to the national voter
 
02:58:49.269 --> 02:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
registration act
 
02:58:51.429 --> 02:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
i i really want to see the
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know the analysis that the prior
 
02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
you know the analysis that the prior
testimony

02:58:54.870 --> 02:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:58:56.710 --> 02:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
has that would suggest that that might
 
02:58:56.720 --> 02:58:57.590 align:start position:0%
has that would suggest that that might
happen

02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not convinced at this point that
 
02:59:01.269 --> 02:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
it would
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you actually i'll just stop there
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative hamer
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
how confident are you with the voter's
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
privacy is kept private
 
02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:15.750 align:start position:0%
privacy is kept private
where

02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:59:18.389 --> 02:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
the mythology the bill established
 
02:59:21.190 --> 02:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
affidavit balloting for voters and the
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit balloting would include a
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
ballot in a different color other than
 
02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it would contain a serialized
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
tear-off strip and will require local
 
02:59:34.230 --> 02:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
election officials to mail the strips to
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm
 
02:59:39.750 --> 02:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
finding this is kind of
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
not keeping the privacy we're very
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about the privacy i believe
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
what you just read was from the original
 
02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:47.030 align:start position:0%
what you just read was from the original
bill

02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
and as amended by the senate that that
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
language is no longer there okay thank
 
02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:53.510 align:start position:0%
language is no longer there okay thank
you

02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
yeah just for clarification it the bill
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at should be
 
03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative terezian
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
secretary skill i'm taking the question
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify a little bit on
 
03:00:10.230 --> 03:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
what you said in regard to because
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions on
 
03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
you cover and the military vote
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
do you believe the bill could be um
 
03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
amended to satisfy that notwithstanding
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
we would have to get creative and how
 
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
that would happen uh but there is no
 
03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
question that there is a federal
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
deadline uh under the uh
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
both java and the federal move act that
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots to military and
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
overseas personnel have to be out no
 
03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:41.510 align:start position:0%
overseas personnel have to be out no
later

03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
than 45 days before the election
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh the bill allows us it's the only uh
 
03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's no longer the only opportunity to
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
email ballots to
 
03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
voters but for you okava voters we can
 
03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
actually email their ballot to them they
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
then then have to download it mark it
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
and then send it back
 
03:01:04.950 --> 03:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
through some type of mail service
 
03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
there is a provision now that
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
is that also exists for uh individuals
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
with print disabilities to take
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of the same type of
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
mr secretary uh that
 
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that you
 
03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
brought that up uh the point
 
03:01:35.590 --> 03:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh about whether
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
electronic means were available under
 
03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
electronic means were available under
yukaba

03:01:39.990 --> 03:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
yukaba
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
has been
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh overlooked up until this time
 
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
and uh um
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm glad that you uh mentioned
 
03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:50.630 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm glad that you uh mentioned
that

03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes um thank you mr
 
03:01:56.790 --> 03:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
secretary you said in your uh testimony
 
03:01:58.870 --> 03:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
something that i've pondered many times
 
03:01:58.880 --> 03:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
something that i've pondered many times
before

03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
which is about the requirement that new
 
03:02:03.429 --> 03:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire's ballots be counted on
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
election night which stems from the fact
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
that the moderator has to announce the
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
results in one continuous meeting um can
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
you elaborate at all on because i've had
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
the same thought it doesn't actually
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
says it doesn't actually say it has to
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
be counted that night it just says one
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
continuous meeting can you elaborate on
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
how that would work with this bill if we
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
were not if we were to implement this
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
and how it could be compliant with the
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
well i i i have a question in my own
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
mind whether
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know we can
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
have some type of a provisional ballot
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's an affidavit ballot or a
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
true provisional ballot and then and
 
03:02:40.790 --> 03:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
then deal with
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh adding or subtracting
 
03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
votes to the overall total after the
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know some days after the election
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
based on the way that that provision in
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
the constitution is written it would
 
03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:53.830 align:start position:0%
the constitution is written it would
require

03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
an interpretation
 
03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:57.349 align:start position:0%
an interpretation
follow-up

03:02:57.349 --> 03:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
so and when we do a recount are we how
 
03:03:03.750 --> 03:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
does a recount factor in with
 
03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
that part of the constitution because we
 
03:03:07.030 --> 03:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
are changing recounts can change
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
election results they rarely do um but
 
03:03:10.469 --> 03:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
they could they most certainly change
 
03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
that not election outcomes election
 
03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
results um so how does how does that
 
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
work is it it seems to me like we've
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
already are kind of i don't want to say
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
violating that but are passed it if you
 
03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:20.469 align:start position:0%
violating that but are passed it if you
will

03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
the recount is only a votes that were
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
cast in the election
 
03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so it's just it's verifying account
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
but it is not adding additional
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
votes or subtracting additional
 
03:03:33.030 --> 03:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
i should say it's not adding
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're subtracting additional ballots
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
that were not counted on the day of the
 
03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:40.630 align:start position:0%
that were not counted on the day of the
election

03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
just if before so to clarify you're
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
distinguishing between the counting of
 
03:03:49.670 --> 03:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
ballots and the actual total yes
 
03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:51.429 align:start position:0%
ballots and the actual total yes
okay

03:03:51.429 --> 03:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative tillerson
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just wondering if
 
03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
you could um comment with your thoughts
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
on how
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
the uh the 10-day time period after uh
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
election day how that could potentially
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
affect our
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
position as first in the nation for the
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think it really would impact
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know counting
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
or subtracting votes
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there would be that
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
many uh affidavit ballots that would
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
affect the outcome of a presidential
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
um you know i i suppose there's an
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
outside possibility that could but i
 
03:04:44.230 --> 03:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the margins are such
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
that you know there's usually a clear
 
03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:48.870 align:start position:0%
that you know there's usually a clear
winner

03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
winner
 
03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
so you don't think
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
the um the view from other parties
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
looking in on new hampshire would
 
03:05:02.309 --> 03:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
question uh the validity in case we did
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
have a close
 
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
close primary
 
03:05:07.590 --> 03:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
well i i don't think that the that an
 
03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
well i i don't think that the that an
affidavit

03:05:09.990 --> 03:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
type out or let's just say it's a
 
03:05:14.230 --> 03:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot uh would make that
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
much of a difference because every other
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
state is operating under the same sort
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
of sort you know same set of
 
03:05:23.590 --> 03:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh conditions most other states have a
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
that if the qualifications of a voter
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
are in doubt on the day of the election
 
03:05:31.349 --> 03:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
the voter gets to vote a provisional
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
ballot and that ballot is counted
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
if it makes a difference in the outcome
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
and only after those qualifications have
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
been proven in another state and
 
03:05:43.830 --> 03:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
um you know i think the the presidential
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
primary the results are going to be
 
03:05:47.110 --> 03:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
announced at the end of the night you
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
know that's going to be the winner um
 
03:05:52.389 --> 03:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know how much of an
 
03:05:52.399 --> 03:05:53.590 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know how much of an
impact

03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know adding or subtracting
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
some votes
 
03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that is going to affect
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
the outcome of you know that process
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
further questions representative baum
 
03:06:08.309 --> 03:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
so the only really the only problem we
 
03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:12.870 align:start position:0%
so the only really the only problem we
have

03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
with these quote
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots is on primary
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
for the 45 days every other election we
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't do not have that problem is that
 
03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
don't do not have that problem is that
correct

03:06:24.150 --> 03:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
that's right the the when we're sending
 
03:06:30.630 --> 03:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
after we prepare the ballots for the
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
for the primary election whether it's
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
the presidential or the state there's
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
more than enough time
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
to get the absentee ballots out to
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
military and overseas citizens it's just
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
that tight time frame between
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
our state primary and the general
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%

wilhelms
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking the question um
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
would you agree with uh the governor's
 
03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
statement earlier this week that 99 of
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
granite staters uh have confidence in
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
our elections
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh i would say that that a few years ago
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh there were some polls that reflected
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
that however more recently
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
the polling is suggesting that that that
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
that statistic is is shaken and
 
03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned before there's a
 
03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
number of reasons for that it's rhetoric
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
at the national level um
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's statements being made
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
from you know the left and the right
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
that that uh you know put doubt in
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
voters minds and
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and social media you know is playing a
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
big role in that as well and you know
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
the trick is how do we how do we put the
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
brakes on that and convince our voting
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
population that
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed our you know our
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
elections are
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
just as sound today as they were 20
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:50.830 align:start position:0%
years ago
thank

03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative hamer
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
people registering to vote on election
 
03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:02.070 align:start position:0%
people registering to vote on election
day

03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
for the first time in new hampshire
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
would be given an affidavit ballot
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't have proof of citizenship
 
03:08:12.230 --> 03:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
or domicile do supervisors of the
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
checklist at the polls know whether a
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
prudential registrant has ever been
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's probably a better question to ask
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know one of the local election
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
it may depend on whether they have
 
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
direct access to election net
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know which is the statewide
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
centralized database
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they could look a voter up to
 
03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they could look a voter up to
see

03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:08:45.750 --> 03:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
if they had voted elsewhere in new
 
03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:47.110 align:start position:0%
if they had voted elsewhere in new
hampshire

03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's still many polling places that
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the connectivity at the
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
polling place itself and i would expect
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
that that might be a tough thing to do
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
further question follow up
 
03:09:02.309 --> 03:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
so how would you handle senate bill 418
 
03:09:04.469 --> 03:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
when it affects a voter who comes into
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
the polls on election day
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
and says he's just bought a new home in
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
a different ward
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
in manchester he sold his other home in
 
03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
the other ward
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
he's voted all his lifetime
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
so he's um
 
03:09:22.229 --> 03:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
he's a new voter
 
03:09:22.239 --> 03:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
he's a new voter
or

03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
would he be subject to this provisional
 
03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
would he be subject to this provisional
ballot

03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:09:29.030 --> 03:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have the answer to that uh
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the moment but i'd be happy to think
 
03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
about it and get back to you
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair and thank you
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking the question um
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
so someone from the brennan center
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
shared what some of the additional
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
expenses might be um
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to implement uh senate bill
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
418 one of the things she talked about
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
was adding temporary staff on election
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
day um
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just having a tough time wrapping my
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
head around all the expenses
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
that would be required if this bill
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:07.429 align:start position:0%
becomes law
what

03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
what those expenses would be
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal note just isn't
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
helpful could you just kind of break it
 
03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
down for us and including temporary
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
stuff i'd be happy to let me let me not
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
do that at the moment but we'll get the
 
03:10:24.469 --> 03:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
work that we've been doing to you very
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
quickly so that you can see the numbers
 
03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
quickly so that you can see the numbers
that

03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
we've been working on okay
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
the the the numbers
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
that were expressed by the brennan
 
03:10:36.870 --> 03:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
center about what it would cost to
 
03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
center about what it would cost to
uh

03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:38.870 --> 03:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
have to comply with the national voter
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
registration act are consistent with
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
what my belief is in terms of those
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
costs okay great thank you further
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%

03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%

03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
chair is this hearing has gone wrong i
 
03:11:08.229 --> 03:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
knew this would be a long hearing but it
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
has gone longer than i thought um and
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
this meeting has to be over by two for
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
the chair so we are not breaking keep
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that in mind for yourselves
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
we are going straight through
 
03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
i have one more two more people after
 
03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
um two more after this uh representative
 
03:11:34.469 --> 03:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
moffatt wants to speak to this bill and
 
03:11:36.550 --> 03:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
senator geider the prime sponsor is here
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
to speak to it it is my intent to close
 
03:11:41.190 --> 03:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing at that time we have
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
noticed exact session
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
given the time and the fact that there
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
are amendments flying around
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't we are not going to exec all
 
03:11:53.750 --> 03:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bills that i had hoped to exec
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
however given that we have
 
03:11:55.680 --> 03:11:57.269 align:start position:0%
however given that we have
members

03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
six members who have driven here today
 
03:12:01.750 --> 03:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
because your chair said we were going to
 
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
exec we will exec one bill
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and it will be 364. so after this
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
hearing we're going right into an exact
 
03:12:12.389 --> 03:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
on 364
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and then we will be breaking for the
 
03:12:17.429 --> 03:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
day so thank you for indulgence if
 
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
people need to take a walk because we're
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to be here for another
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
15-20 minutes uh if you need to take a
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
walk down the hall this might be a good
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
time so having said that i apologize for
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
taking you literally to my sort of
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
snapshot of the end of the day and
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
welcome for you to us thank you
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
um my name is thank you uh chairman
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
griffin and representatives i'm a
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist in derry i'm
 
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
just beginning my third term and jerry
 
03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
is the largest has the largest voters
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
checklist in the state
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer procedural questions
 
03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer procedural questions
for

03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
for anybody i i submitted written
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony because i didn't think i could
 
03:13:03.110 --> 03:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
so i hope you'll read that but
 
03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to talk about some
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised by other
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
speakers and
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
points that haven't already been made
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
the first thing is that i in
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
sb 418 will affect a far higher number
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
than is being anticipated
 
03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:27.590 align:start position:0%
than is being anticipated
because

03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
mr clementowitz mentioned 816 people
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
use citizenship affidavits in 2020.
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's only what's recorded in the state
 
03:13:37.439 --> 03:13:38.630 align:start position:0%
that's only what's recorded in the state
database

03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:13:40.070 --> 03:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
nearly everyone who completes a
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
citizenship affidavit is not entered in
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
the database
 
03:13:49.830 --> 03:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
flat flag a checkbox
 
03:13:52.960 --> 03:13:53.990 align:start position:0%
flat flag a checkbox
for

03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavit for
 
03:13:55.359 --> 03:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavit for
citizenship

03:13:56.790 --> 03:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
03:13:58.150 --> 03:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
if the person was
 
03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
born outside the u.s most of the people
 
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
born outside the u.s became naturalized
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
citizens and they are aware of the
 
03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be asked to establish
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
citizenship and they generally tend to
 
03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:11.510 align:start position:0%
citizenship and they generally tend to
bring

03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
bring
 
03:14:11.520 --> 03:14:12.309 align:start position:0%
bring
um

03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
documents with them a passport or a
 
03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
naturalization certificate
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
people um that are born in the u.s that
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
are more likely to fill it out so
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
the database can easily be reprogrammed
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
to allow us to flag them but the problem
 
03:14:31.590 --> 03:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
the estimates based on what's in the
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
system now are grossly inadequate
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
in derry we have 2 200 people registered
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
to vote on a non-coven presidential
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
election half at least half of those
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
people will complete a citizenship
 
03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit it only exists in paper form
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the files in
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
town offices around the state
 
03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:57.190 align:start position:0%
town offices around the state
so

03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
that would need solely for citizenship
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
domicile is easy to
 
03:15:06.399 --> 03:15:07.990 align:start position:0%
domicile is easy to
establish

03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
establish
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
people carry the license or other id
 
03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
around in their wallet
 
03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:13.510 align:start position:0%
around in their wallet
um

03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
same with identity but citizenship is
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
not something people carry around with
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
them or keep handy
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
as other speakers mentioned and realize
 
03:15:25.110 --> 03:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
real id does not apply social security
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
card doesn't establish it military id
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't establish it
 
03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't establish it
so

03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
so i think that the costs
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
will will be much higher at twenty seven
 
03:15:36.479 --> 03:15:38.229 align:start position:0%
will will be much higher at twenty seven
dollars

03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
per envelope
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
the number of the number of affidavit
 
03:15:49.120 --> 03:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
the number of the number of affidavit
ballots

03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
will therefore will also exceed the
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
margins of victory
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
meaning that most
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:04.229 --> 03:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
will be in limbo for for two to three
 
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
weeks um
 
03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:07.510 align:start position:0%
weeks um
and

03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
to get for the town clerks to get out
 
03:16:18.630 --> 03:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
over military and overseas ballots
 
03:16:20.790 --> 03:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it will also negatively affect
 
03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
public confidence in the integrity of
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
elections when the results change
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
and also people want people
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
people want news immediately
 
03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
when it takes longer
 
03:16:36.550 --> 03:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
people think this fraud
 
03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:39.269 align:start position:0%
people think this fraud
um

03:16:39.269 --> 03:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.279 --> 03:16:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
some

03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
mr o'brien brought up
 
03:16:46.469 --> 03:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
for the explanation for first-time
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
voters and uh
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlan mentioned that also
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
the way that
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
the current law is in
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
sb 418 would be the same
 
03:16:57.120 --> 03:16:58.710 align:start position:0%
sb 418 would be the same
it

03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
exempts voters who have previously
 
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
registered in new hampshire
 
03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:04.550 align:start position:0%
registered in new hampshire
that

03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
the way to tell that is to look them up
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the database but we have three
 
03:17:12.389 --> 03:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist in derry
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
and with 2200 people we're not look we
 
03:17:17.190 --> 03:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
don't have time only the only the three
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
elected supervisors are able to look
 
03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
that information up
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
even if we have
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
laptops and a secure connection and a
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
reliable connection
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
there's no way that we could
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
ever look up 1100 people
 
03:17:37.990 --> 03:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
we have between 24 to 36
 
03:17:40.150 --> 03:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
assistant supervisors helping people on
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
election day and they they can't funnel
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
all those people in to see three people
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
um so what we do
 
03:17:48.479 --> 03:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
um so what we do
is

03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:17:51.510 --> 03:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
we require everyone since it's a
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement to prove
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
citizenship even if they list they were
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
born in the u.s
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
we require them to fill out a qualified
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.229 --> 03:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you you're i just if you've got
 
03:18:08.550 --> 03:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
i think that this defeats voter id okay
 
03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
because it allows the supervisors of the
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
checklist to verify the identity of
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
voters who don't possess a photo id
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
when they check in
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
that that presumably would mean
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
us looking people up in the in the voter
 
03:18:29.190 --> 03:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
list there's not all that many people
 
03:18:31.190 --> 03:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
that don't have an id so that's not the
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
issue the issue is
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the voter id that
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
would prevent somebody from voting in
 
03:18:39.269 --> 03:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
the name of a recently
 
03:18:40.950 --> 03:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
said there's not
 
03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:42.150 align:start position:0%
said there's not
nothing

03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
that process
 
03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
means that the per
 
03:18:48.389 --> 03:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
allowing supervisors to identify someone
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
through the voter checklist means that
 
03:18:53.110 --> 03:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
that person is not didn't present a
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
photograph and is not photographed as
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
part of an affidavit process
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the voter records don't contain
 
03:18:59.600 --> 03:19:01.349 align:start position:0%
the voter records don't contain
photographs

03:19:01.349 --> 03:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
photographs
 
03:19:03.190 --> 03:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
and all the information that's in there
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
the non-public information
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
is generally available in obituaries so
 
03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
anybody who recently died
 
03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:12.550 align:start position:0%
anybody who recently died
is

03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:19:14.710 --> 03:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
their obituary is going to have the date
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
of birth where they were born the kind
 
03:19:18.630 --> 03:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
of questions that the supervisors could
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
ask is publicly available
 
03:19:21.279 --> 03:19:21.990 align:start position:0%
ask is publicly available
so

03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
one other thing that would need to be
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
clarified if this passes is that
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist cannot
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
touch ballots we couldn't hand affidavit
 
03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
ballots to people
 
03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot
 
03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:41.429 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot
packets

03:19:41.429 --> 03:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
packets
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
to people and we can't
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
instruct people on how to how to
 
03:19:48.790 --> 03:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
complete the voting process
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
so that right now it says authorized
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
election official and that should be
 
03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
election official and that should be
clarified

03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%

03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
up on the secretary of state's uh
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
comments by just quickly sharing that i
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
had a state rep i am a state rep by the
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
way for the record uh mike moffat
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 9 canterbury and
 
03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:30.710 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 9 canterbury and
loudoun

03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
loudoun
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
i did have a state rep race years ago
 
03:20:34.389 --> 03:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
that ended in a tie
 
03:20:35.910 --> 03:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
a tie
 
03:20:37.590 --> 03:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
so obviously there was a recount and on
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
the recount i dropped one vote on the
 
03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
the recount i dropped one vote on the
recount

03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
recount
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to underscore that
 
03:20:46.710 --> 03:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
every vote counts uh in my case uh
 
03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
later on some folks looked into same-day
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
registrants uh some of the same-day
 
03:20:52.950 --> 03:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
registrants uh could not be tracked down
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
they may have voted for me we don't know
 
03:20:57.190 --> 03:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
so that's less than minutes all i wanted
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
to say was every vote counts and efforts
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
to ensure uh the integrity of our
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
elections i think need full uh
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair and i'll take questions if
 
03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
madam chair and i'll take questions if
are

03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative moffat
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
all right and then
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then we have senator gaida i have
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
nobody else signed up to speak on this
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
so the sponsor usually goes first so
 
03:21:25.269 --> 03:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is i think maybe my first hearing
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
where the sponsor is actually going last
 
03:21:28.469 --> 03:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
so welcome to senator guida thank you
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%

i appreciate the committee's indulgence
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
in allowing me to speak after the
 
03:21:40.150 --> 03:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
commencement of the hearing
 
03:21:42.150 --> 03:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
i was at a medical appointment as the
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
saying goes
 
03:21:50.550 --> 03:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:53.190 --> 03:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
the right to vote
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
it is a qualified right
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we as a legislator are
 
03:22:04.469 --> 03:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
constitutionally empowered to establish
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
every living breathing person on the
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
planet is not entitled to vote
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but under current law
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
any living breathing person on the
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:23.429 --> 03:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
i can come here i sign a paper that says
 
03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a citizen or i live here okay
 
03:22:33.190 --> 03:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
we've had over two and a half million
 
03:22:34.950 --> 03:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
people come across the southern border
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the last few years and more are
 
03:22:38.560 --> 03:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
in the last few years and more are
coming

03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:43.990 --> 03:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're here voting we
 
03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:48.550 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're here voting we
don't

03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
with the affidavit system a person
 
03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
vouches that i am who i am i live where
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
i live i am a citizen whatever the case
 
03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:59.030 --> 03:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
but the follow-up
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
is irrelevant
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
why do i say that
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the follow-up is irrelevant because
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
by the time
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
the 60-day window has expired for the
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to deliver the
 
03:23:14.830 --> 03:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
questionable ballots
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general and by the time
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is completed with
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
the investigation
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
the vote has already been counted cast
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
and certified that's the loophole that
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to close
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
bill stops no one from voting
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
it creates no new restrictions
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
it says within the existing
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
qualifications already established in
 
03:23:38.399 --> 03:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
qualifications already established in
law

03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:23:42.070 --> 03:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
you who have failed as a citizen in your
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
civic duty to meet the obligation to
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
qualify to vote
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're giving you an extra 10 days and
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
telling you what it is you need to
 
03:23:49.439 --> 03:23:51.269 align:start position:0%
telling you what it is you need to
provide

03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:23:53.429 --> 03:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i do that to protect the sanctity of
 
03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
the vote not to exclude anyone i don't
 
03:23:57.429 --> 03:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
target college kids i don't target
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
immigrants i target
 
03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
qualified voters
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
it is not an unqualified right
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at the notes
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
in the preamble if you will the findings
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay on average
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
basically one race a year is won or lost
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
by a vote
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
when you go to look at the number by two
 
03:24:21.190 --> 03:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
or three or five the number goes up very
 
03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:23.190 align:start position:0%
or three or five the number goes up very
significantly

03:24:23.190 --> 03:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
03:24:25.030 --> 03:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
this data was given to me by bill
 
03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:26.710 align:start position:0%
this data was given to me by bill
gardner

03:24:26.710 --> 03:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
gardner
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill and myself secretary scanlon
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on this bill as did
 
03:24:34.389 --> 03:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
senator i'm sorry representative former
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
justice bob lynn
 
03:24:39.190 --> 03:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
i told representative lin put your
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
justice hat on and rip this to shreds
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
senator you may not know what he's
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
walked in the room
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
i asked him i
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't say i won't care i said
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not concerned
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay and so
 
03:24:53.279 --> 03:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
okay and so
um

03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:55.670 align:start position:0%
um
again

03:24:55.670 --> 03:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is attempting to close a
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
gaping loophole
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay and when people say that
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
establishing this process which
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
increases nothing except if you show up
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
you sign an affidavit you get a document
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
that says with an envelope paid by the
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
state you need to return the proof of
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
that qualification that you claim you
 
03:25:14.319 --> 03:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
that qualification that you claim you
have

03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
not doing that
 
03:25:19.750 --> 03:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
renders our system vulnerable
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
and dishonors the service of the
 
03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
millions who have given their lives to
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
protect the sanctity of the vote
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
the sanctity of the qualified vote the
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
sanctity of the citizens vote
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
not the sanctity of the vote of any
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
living breathing human being
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
we are it's a qualified vote
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to the military
 
03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
i served in the marine corps i served
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
during vietnam i served subsidies to
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
that i served my country as an fbi agent
 
03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
my son is in the navy as an officer at
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
this time my wife was a navy nurse to
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
those that might insinuate or imply that
 
03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill ever intended
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
to deny the right to vote to the
 
03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:00.630 align:start position:0%
to deny the right to vote to the
military

03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
military
 
03:26:03.670 --> 03:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
i reject that assertion i will say
 
03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:04.389 align:start position:0%
i reject that assertion i will say
that

03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:05.910 --> 03:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
there is a bill before you senate bill
 
03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:07.429 align:start position:0%
there is a bill before you senate bill
328

03:26:07.429 --> 03:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
328
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
that will move the primary back to
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
august it was you it was voted on you i
 
03:26:14.309 --> 03:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
won't see unanimous bipartisan in the
 
03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
senate it is before you now
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason for that doing so
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
enables our federal candidates to have
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
access to much more of the funding
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
available which is gone by the time our
 
03:26:28.469 --> 03:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
primary in september is closed
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for this
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
all right you'll deliberate that bill in
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
concert with this
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
03:26:40.710 --> 03:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
an overseas military ballot problem
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
so again
 
03:26:44.950 --> 03:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's not an unqualified vote
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
the process is not difficult
 
03:26:49.190 --> 03:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
you won't have any longer lines than you
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
have now
 
03:26:51.670 --> 03:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
03:26:54.870 --> 03:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to require someone that says
 
03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
believe me
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
i'm a u.s citizen believe me i live here
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
and can't produce any of the list of
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
documents provided to prove residency
 
03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:06.150 align:start position:0%
documents provided to prove residency
right

03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
we're gonna say okay we believe you
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
your vote will be counted but it will
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
not be certified certification of the
 
03:27:14.229 --> 03:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
ballots right now in the house and the
 
03:27:14.239 --> 03:27:15.269 align:start position:0%
ballots right now in the house and the
senate

03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
is a ceremonial process
 
03:27:19.269 --> 03:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state comes in the
 
03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
president's senate picks three people
 
03:27:22.389 --> 03:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
they go out yeah yeah they come back in
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's certified this gives meaning
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
to the certification of that ballot
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
it protects the sanctity
 
03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
of the right of qualified citizens of
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the united states to vote
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
and it protects the sanctity of the vote
 
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
of every new hampshire resident in
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%

03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
case is are these forms being held on
 
03:28:24.630 --> 03:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
by the moderator to return them up to a
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
day later
 
03:28:27.190 --> 03:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question the reason
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
we worded it that way that does not
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
preclude those documents from going
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
with the certification okay that sent
 
03:28:35.910 --> 03:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
the day of the election it just gives
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
them an extra day in case perhaps
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
something got misplaced or they wanted
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
to verify but it doesn't preclude them
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
going at the same time it just says well
 
03:28:45.429 --> 03:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
you've got an extra day if you need it
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay further question i'm sure follow up
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and this is
 
03:28:51.349 --> 03:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
kind of a question i asked at the
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of this hearing hours ago
 
03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:56.150 align:start position:0%
beginning of this hearing hours ago
um

03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:56.160 --> 03:28:57.269 align:start position:0%
 
given

03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
spent almost four million dollars
 
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
litigating senate b
 
03:29:03.190 --> 03:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
03:29:05.110 --> 03:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
and given that there was a
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
federal court decision in 2020 fish
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
versus schwab in in kansas which ruled
 
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
that the requirement for documentary
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship was a violation of
 
03:29:16.950 --> 03:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment under the equal
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
protection clause
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
why didn't the senate uh
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
take the secretary of state's
 
03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
advice or suggestion
 
03:29:27.190 --> 03:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
that uh our supreme court be asked for
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
an opinion on the constitutionality of
 
03:29:30.870 --> 03:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
well i will share this with you
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
there have been three decisions in the
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
nation made by the us supreme court
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
which is irrelevant let me strike that
 
03:29:38.800 --> 03:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
which is irrelevant let me strike that
remark

03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
remark
 
03:29:39.920 --> 03:29:40.870 align:start position:0%
remark
um

03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:43.349 --> 03:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
we opted not to do it because
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we should
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
subordinate our
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
laws that are proposed
 
03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the opinions of justices who since
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're not in law
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we send to them can be taken apart
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
based on whatever it is they choose to
 
03:29:57.920 --> 03:29:59.429 align:start position:0%
based on whatever it is they choose to
say

03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we as a legislative
 
03:30:03.510 --> 03:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
branch subordinate our opinions
 
03:30:05.590 --> 03:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
our actions to the courts
 
03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
constitution says are separate and equal
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
let's keep it that way i thought about
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
this question
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
and i signify specifically said i will
 
03:30:13.279 --> 03:30:14.710 align:start position:0%
and i signify specifically said i will
not

03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
subordinate this this is an issue
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
of of the sanctity of the vote
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay and to say that
 
03:30:24.469 --> 03:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask the court's mother
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
may i
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
i won't do that i just will not do that
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
i have no further questions further
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
senator gaiden kinda uh wouldn't this
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill also say that make sure that my
 
03:30:44.309 --> 03:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
vote will not be overwritten by somebody
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
else's vote
 
03:30:48.309 --> 03:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
your question is quite correct your
 
03:30:50.710 --> 03:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
answer is quite correct in a way um
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
and it's true we're here to protect the
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
sanctity of each vote
 
03:30:56.870 --> 03:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's in the sanctity of the qualified
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
voters ballots
 
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
not the sanctity of those unqualified
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
note for the record i didn't say fraud i
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
didn't say theft i said unqualified
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
and that's what we must assure as
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
carrying the trust of the people of the
 
03:31:10.720 --> 03:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
carrying the trust of the people of the
state

03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:31:17.190 --> 03:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative murad i had
 
03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
you down and forgot go ahead thank you
 
03:31:21.040 --> 03:31:21.910 align:start position:0%
you down and forgot go ahead thank you
man

03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
man
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
03:31:23.439 --> 03:31:25.670 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
um

03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that someone who
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
registers to vote 30 days or more in
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
advance of an election
 
03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
well everybody has to prove four things
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
as you know senator citizenship
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
age domicile and identity
 
03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
and voters registering more than 30 days
 
03:31:46.150 --> 03:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
in advance of an election can prove
 
03:31:48.550 --> 03:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
citizenship by signing a sworn statement
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
on the voter registration form
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
as i read the bill it looks like
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
voters registering day of
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
will need to produce a passport
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
or a birth certificate or not
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers
 
03:32:04.950 --> 03:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
is the intention of the bill to create
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
excellent question thank you uh no it is
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
not and i focus exclusively on looking
 
03:32:13.830 --> 03:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
very hard at same day registrants people
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
that come up the day of the election you
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
got two years between elections to
 
03:32:20.070 --> 03:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
register and and produce documentation
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
um what we're looking at is
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the last minute person
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
that comes up
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
is in fact qualified to vote and it is
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
no way intended to create a dual class
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
if you will on the right on the uh
 
03:32:35.190 --> 03:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
qualification for citizenship
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a follow-up on the
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship question uh madam chair on
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
the city on the
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
type of fraud that you know passport or
 
03:32:43.520 --> 03:32:44.389 align:start position:0%
type of fraud that you know passport or
um

03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
birth certificate
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
or uh naturalization papers would guard
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
against which is someone voting who's
 
03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
not a citizen of the united states as
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to say someone voting in two
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
different states or something who is a
 
03:32:55.200 --> 03:32:57.990 align:start position:0%
different states or something who is a
citizen

03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.150 --> 03:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
do well do you know of how many people
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
located or convicted of
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
having voted in new hampshire who have
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
it turns out not been citizens of the
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
united states in
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
some window of time like the last 10 or
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
03:33:12.790 --> 03:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't know and i don't believe we have
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
the data we have no way of knowing
 
03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
the data we have no way of knowing
so

03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
include a hundred to the thousand
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
possibly could zero possibly
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
again uh what we're trying to do is
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
close this loophole this gaping hole in
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
our in the integrity of our elections
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
and and the quality of our elections and
 
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
the process is not it's not a question
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
here we have an excellent process
 
03:33:34.080 --> 03:33:35.349 align:start position:0%
here we have an excellent process
but

03:33:35.349 --> 03:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeping for that process is
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
what's lacking
 
03:33:40.150 --> 03:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
once you're into our system it works
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
fabulously i've been moderating just
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
finished as a moderator for my town for
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
the system works great we have great
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
officials we've got great volunteers and
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
a good process but
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
the entry into that system
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
is what is the vulnerability to its
 
03:33:54.720 --> 03:33:57.750 align:start position:0%
is what is the vulnerability to its
integrity

03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you senator thank you sir further
 
03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:03.510 align:start position:0%
thank you senator thank you sir further
questions

03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.150 --> 03:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
question senator um i'm curious about
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
what we heard earlier about um a
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
potential conflict with part one article
 
03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:15.910 align:start position:0%
potential conflict with part one article
2b

03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
2b
 
03:34:18.309 --> 03:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh the right to privacy and having our
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
information protected um would you agree
 
03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
information protected um would you agree
that

03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:25.510 --> 03:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
one's ballot and how they vote would
 
03:34:27.269 --> 03:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
fall under that uh part of our
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
conference absolutely i would also state
 
03:34:29.920 --> 03:34:31.110 align:start position:0%
conference absolutely i would also state
that

03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's no more disclosure of personal
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
voting information in this
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
than there is with the opening of
 
03:34:39.830 --> 03:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots by a moderator
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
moderator handles a ballot it's marked
 
03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
what we did in this bill is we
 
03:34:47.190 --> 03:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
structured very carefully all the
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
processes in here mirror already
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
existing processes in state law for
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
particular election
 
03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
particular election
components

03:34:55.030 --> 03:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
components
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
and again that was one with with the
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
help of the secretary of state that was
 
03:35:00.550 --> 03:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the help of some volunteers
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think there is that
 
03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:05.110 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think there is that
threat

03:35:05.110 --> 03:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
threat
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay the ballots are never named they're
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
numbered and the moderator does that now
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
um they're separately placed because
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
once you mark a ballot you run the risk
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
of messing up a machine that might read
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
it so they're put in hand counted all
 
03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
it so they're put in hand counted all
right

03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
so people that we trust
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
the moderator
 
03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
are the ones that would see
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
what was on a ballot if he or she chose
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
to look and no moderator that i know
 
03:35:29.590 --> 03:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
would do that we respect
 
03:35:32.790 --> 03:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
fully the right to privacy that ballot
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
just a very quick thank you we we heard
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
earlier today about a
 
03:35:39.030 --> 03:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
town election where there was one
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
challenge voter affidavit david and it
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
seems to me in small town and we have a
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
lot of small towns in new hampshire that
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
anyone who was voting who was in there
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
and saw someone walk out with one of
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
those folders and then saw a change in
 
03:35:50.710 --> 03:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
the totals ten days later would be able
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
to put two and two together um you don't
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
feel that that's a violation of that
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
did you restate that question
 
03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
did you restate that question
sorry

03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
we we heard uh anecdote about i believe
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
it was milford the town of milford uh
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the most recent election they had one
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
person that had to sign a challenge vote
 
03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
after david and if this bill were to
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
become law they would have walked out
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
with their
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
27 prepaid envelope to return the
 
03:36:20.150 --> 03:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office and if
 
03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
another voter
 
03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh was in the proc in the area not
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily an election official and saw
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
their neighbor john doe walking out with
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
that envelope
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you think that um 10 days later
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
if they then saw in milford that
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
certain races all dropped by one vote
 
03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they would know that their
 
03:36:45.190 --> 03:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
neighbor john doe voted for
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
these different candidates if the total
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
drop by one vote is because the person
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
that voted was not qualified to vote and
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
and so the question then becomes
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
do they have the right to privacy of
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
that ballot since it's going to go to
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
court if the system works as it's
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to it's not going to be private
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge anymore
 
03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bergeron
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chairman just a
 
03:37:16.469 --> 03:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to your response to
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
the representative's question
 
03:37:20.550 --> 03:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
you said if that person's vote was
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
disqualified because the voter was
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
not eligible to vote isn't it true that
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's just that the voter didn't return
 
03:37:30.150 --> 03:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
the required documentation he may have
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
been certainly eligible to vote
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
it was just the paperwork was eligible
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
but not qualified according to the
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
constitution and the laws of this state
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
and that is what we are sworn to uphold
 
03:37:43.510 --> 03:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
i come back to the point that qualified
 
03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:44.469 align:start position:0%
i come back to the point that qualified
voter

03:37:44.469 --> 03:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
voter
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
not any voter it's a qualified right
 
03:37:48.870 --> 03:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's not an unqualified right
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
and for that reason a person does not
 
03:37:52.630 --> 03:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
produce those qualifications that ballot
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
is invalid it's not fraudulent fraud
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
goes to intent
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's invalid it's unqualified the vote
 
03:38:00.630 --> 03:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be subtracted
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
this is not a provisional ballot i'll
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
throw that in because the provisional
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
ballot doesn't count the vote until the
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
certificate until the qualification is
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
proven by the voter
 
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
in this case we're counting it because
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
the constitution requires that or that's
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
been the interpretation but we're going
 
03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
to then say well well secretary of state
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
gets a document that's required it's
 
03:38:17.439 --> 03:38:18.229 align:start position:0%
gets a document that's required it's
over

03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get the document it's
 
03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:20.630 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get the document it's
required

03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
an email goes up or letter goes up to
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
the town
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
and they then will send the number and
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
the doc and the verification letter with
 
03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
the um with the ballot will then go to
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
the attorney general for their their
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
deal you know for their taking care of
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh potential prosecution

thank you
