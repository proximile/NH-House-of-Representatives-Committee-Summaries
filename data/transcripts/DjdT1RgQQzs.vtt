4 I've brought you this bill this
 
00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
morning seeking to dissolve several
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
offices and um divisions within the
 
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
offices and um divisions within the
executives

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
executives
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
Department first these programs ought to
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
be considered both unlawful and
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as they represent
 
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
affirmative discrimination by government
 
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
based on various mostly immutable
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
characteristics it was these programs
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
during covid that promulgated policies
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
that withheld scarce medical resources
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
color it was these offices that advanced
 
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
concepts such as the social determinance
 
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
of Health that are designed to
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate political activism into
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
healthc care based on the premise that
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
the political environment can affect
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
Health it is these offices that seek to
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
shutter politically disfavored industry
 
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
and energy resources based on the legal
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
magic of disperate impact and have
 
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
thereby endangered the stability of our
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
electrical grid and driven prices
 
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
up broadly these Concepts represent a
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
purposeful attempt to flip perceived
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
hierarchies by elevating the marginal
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
and punishing the privileged
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
in other words it defies everyone as
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
supposedly oppressor or oppressed
 
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
departing from the American Constitution
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
they lean on the social analysis of Carl
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
Marx and John Jax rouso to justify this
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
evil as such departing from the American
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
concept of justice as both impartial and
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
individual they rather imposed penalties
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
based on not individual actions but on
 
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.029 align:start position:0%
based on not individual actions but on
identity

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics the concepts of Dei
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
equity and social justice is derived
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
from the new school of marxist analysis
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
known as the Frankfurt School famously
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
existing at Columbia
 
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
University these Concepts found their
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
way into American law and jurist
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
Prudence largely via Harvard University
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
critical legal studies under Derek Bell
 
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s gave way to critical race
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
Theory under his student Kimberly
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
krenshaw a couple decades later with her
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
supposedly ground breaking Marxist
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
analysis in mapping the margins in
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
reality it was little more than what was
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
already being done by the common turn
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
almost a century
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
earlier thankfully these Concepts have
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
now been roundly rejected by the
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
American people and the citizens of New
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
Hamshire at The Ballot Box we were put
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
in this position to definitively end
 
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
these discriminatory punitive and
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
divisive programs when I filed this bill
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
it was still a bit of a mystery as to
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
what position we would be in at this
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
moment I'm happy to now report that the
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
position I staked out in this bill is
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
now reflected in federal policy of the
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
executive now contrary to any
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions that we might lose Federal
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
funding if we were to move forward with
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
eliminating these offices on the
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
contrary we're far more liable to lose
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
Federal funding if we do
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
not the Federal Executive has issued a
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
series of executive orders some of which
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
I have passed out as handouts to remove
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
root and Branch all aspects of Dei
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
including environmental justice
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
practices from the federal
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
government the federal Justice or the
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
federal government the Federal Executive
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
has declared these programs to be
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
unlawful now when the Federal Executive
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
makes a de a declaration like that
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
they're not merely opining what they're
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
saying is that a failure to abide by
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
their declarations may result in
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions including under the
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act which would open this
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
lawsuits as far as the necessity of
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
having enforcement of civil rights which
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
I don't dispute that exists in our
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
department of justice where it belongs
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
not in any other department where it is
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
being used to smuggle social justice
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
into policy
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
and go around this
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
legislature we must act it is good and
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
righteous to act now the people demand
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
it and our Oaths demand it thank you I
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take questions thank
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
Bela representative
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um a lot of us
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
here on this committee were Health and
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
Human Services so we may not be familiar
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
with some of the Departments I know I'm
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
not for example familiar with the
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services um
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
functions for civil rights and
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
environmental justice that's kind of
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
outside of the purview of this
 
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:18.519 align:start position:0%
department so could you um I was unaware
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
that even existed could you describe
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
what that is and what these functions
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
are in terms of environmental justice
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you for that
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
question it's a very good question
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
so environmental justice is quite
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
similar to any of the other sort of bad
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
terms Justice that you've heard uh
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
thrown around in recent years in that it
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean American impartial
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
individual Justice what it means is
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
social justice applied to a certain
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
field of policy so what they've done is
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
they've applied social justice to the
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
field of environmental policy and what
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
has happened is through a series of um
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
less than stellar older judicial
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
precedents such as disperate impact
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
they've managed to say that any industry
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
or energy resource or anything of the
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
sort that can be argued to have a
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
disproportionate effect on one group
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
versus another group can result in civil
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions and be shut down
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
under the opes of uh environmental
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
justice so simply put what that means is
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
if there's a power plant that is
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
producing some kind of um environmental
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
pollution even if it's well mitigated
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
only a small amount if it can be found
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
that for instance a power plant might be
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
found in an area that is dis
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
disproportionately of lower income well
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
because that disproportionately affects
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
people of lower income it can be said to
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory and therefore they can
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
use it as a cudle to shut that industry
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
down and it's been used that way um by
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
the executive branch for the last
 
00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
the executive branch for the last
several

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
years oh
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
questions I'm representative Maser thank
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for being here
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
today and uh taking my question I see
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
the last uh the last
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
sentence um in the description of it as
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
dissolving the governor's Council on
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion am I correct in
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
thinking that saying that that he did
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
dissolve that on his way out of his the
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
end of his term yes thank you for the
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
question is my understanding that that
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh advisory Council no longer exists um
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
however the bill does go on to say that
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
reestablishment of of such uh advisory
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
council is prohibited under this bill if
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
it were to pass so it's still relevant
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of going forward thank you
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you no
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
oh Mark you got to raise your hand r or
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
something sorry Mr chair um and thank
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um you
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about uh the legal
 
00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:10.839 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy um we do see certain private
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
businesses you know Walmart Facebook and
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
even universities moving away from some
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
of these programs in many cases um the
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
universities I think actually favor and
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
would like to go on with these but they
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
do see some potential uh legal Jeopardy
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
but are you aware of any specific
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
incidents where uh This legal Jeopardy
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
has manifested itself or is it just the
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
threat at this
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
point thank you for the question I don't
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
have the citations off the top of my
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
head but yes there have been in recent
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
years a number of judicial precedents
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
set I don't think any of them have gone
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
to scotus yet but there have been at
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
least lower and appeals score president
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
set finding that the policies of Dei Dei
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
J have um been found to be violative of
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act because they are
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
not based on the idea of individual
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
impartial Justice they're based on the
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
idea of purposfully discriminating
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
against somebody who's perceived to have
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
more privilege than somebody
 
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.949 align:start position:0%
more privilege than somebody
else

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
followup um so if you don't have those
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
specific references in front of you
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for you to after
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
the fact provide those to the committee
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
Absolutely I'll find some examples to
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
send you thank you
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative Woods thank you Mr
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
question uh help me out I guess I uh
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
need clarification on uh in uh uh
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
section one uh the governor hereby
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
directed to dissolve the council uh and
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's prohibited from reestablish I is it
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
the purview of the legislature to tell
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
the governor what he can and can't do
 
00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.870 align:start position:0%
the governor what he can and can't do
regarding

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
Council thank you and that is a very
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
good question and the end of the day
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
like like most other things the courts
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
would be have to step in if there was a
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
dispute to look at that issue however
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking it is the job of this
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
legislature to direct the executive in
 
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
what to do and on the basic principle
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
that this commission I believe it was
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
called uh was established to create uh
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
and promulgate policy based on Equity
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
Justice and inclusion and that those
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
policies themselves go against the
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution the Civil Rights Act and
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
our oath of office they ought not be
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
reestablished and I believe we do have
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the authority to dictate that
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes other
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative L
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
montin thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
question why do you believe some of
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
these programs were set up to begin
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
worth U thank you for the question so I
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
went a little bit into the history of it
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
these these programs were largely
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
established based on the precedent set
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
by critical legal Theory which is an
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
idea that came from Derek Bell at
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
Harvard University not on his own it was
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
a it was a followup of uh sort of the
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
work that had been done at the Frankfurt
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
School to normalize within American
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
juror Prudence The Concept that we ought
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
not treat people always as individuals
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
but sometimes we should treat them as
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
groups according to their identity this
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
made their way into American uh jurist
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
prudence and many lawyers have been
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
trained along this lines in time since
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
um so it was it was a long slow process
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
to move these Concepts from their
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
ideological foundations in Columbia
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
University and other places in America
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
through Harvard through the legal system
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
through the Education and Training of
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
lawyers and judges um it's been a very
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
long process thank you can I have follow
 
00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.269 align:start position:0%
long process thank you can I have follow
follow

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:55.949 align:start position:0%
follow
up

00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
um but you don't have any actual
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
evidence that people that um helped
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
bring these programs about were actually
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
Marxist and and these programs weren't
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
actually based on empirical evidence
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
showing disparities of health and
 
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.269 align:start position:0%
showing disparities of health and
environmental

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh thank you I think I can find
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
the question there it was so I I can
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
along with the uh judicial precedence
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
that I'll find for you later I can find
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
for you the name of the book because I
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't remember top of my head it was
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of an
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
introduction to critical uh legal Theory
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
it was a textbook that was utilized uh
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
at Harvard and and has been utilized by
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
many others since that identified in
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
fact that Derek Bell Kimberly krenshaw
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
and the others who promulgated these
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
ideas and and moved them out from the
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
academic sphere into the into the uh
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
governmental sphere and into policy
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
marxists other questions
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
over here representative Nagel and then
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative McKay thank you Mr
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
um I I've been working with people a
 
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations patients for a
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
really long time um I think more
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
pragmatically than theoretically and I
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to read this to you um do
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes I do okay the
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
question's coming from what I read okay
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um if you look at the DHHS is
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
website it talks about the office of
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
Health Equity that I believe would be
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated if if this bill passes it
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
says they assure Equitable access to
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
effective quality programs and services
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
across all populations with specialized
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
focus on breaking down barriers to care
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
for vulnerable New Hampshire P residents
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
in my experience that's a really
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
important function and I'm just curious
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
if that goes away how do we replace that
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
keyw there was the very first word that
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
was in that state stat Equitable access
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
it is not equal access it is not access
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
that looks determinant at who has the
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
greatest need Equity by definition looks
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
at People based on identity
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
characteristics not upon based upon need
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
which is the same reason that these uh
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
these offices promulgated the idea
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
during covid-19 that withheld scarce
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
resources on the basis of skin color not
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
need Al that I know but I'll I'll stop
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
there representative McKay thank you Mr
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
chairman the the first part of this
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislation is not is not needed which
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
you know the second part says we can
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
never do it again I find that
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
peculiar uh that telling the legislature
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
what we can't do most
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislation tells us what we can do
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually do you have a question
 
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
actually do you have a question
represent

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that is an
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate um use of
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for that question
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear I do not believe it
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
does that at all that's actually a
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
misreading of that this tells the
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch what it can and cannot
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
do in the future it does not in any way
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
bind this legislature which we ought to
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
know according to our own rules and and
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
President we can't pass anything that
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
binds future legislators so they could
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
undo this if they wanted to down the
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
road that would be up to them in passing
 
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
road that would be up to them in passing
further

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you other questions
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
representative Markel thank you for
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um earlier uh earlier
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
sir you mentioned that this is
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional did I hear that
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
correctly that in other words what's
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
presently going on is unconstitutional
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
did I hear that correctly yes I believe
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
the policies themselves have be
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional what okay but this is
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
you would agree would you not that this
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
is basically
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
Health regulation do I have that correct
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
regulation I I would say it goes a lot
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
deeper than that it goes to a basic
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
concept of what Justice is and what
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Justice is under the Constitution versus
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
what Justice is under a paradigm of
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
social justice okay but not necessarily
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
social justice but we're here in front
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
may may follow up thank you thank you so
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
um my concern is is that I think you
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
suggested that this is unconstitutional
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
analysis I wouldn't say it's based on a
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny analysis because I'm not
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
trying to take into account government
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
extreme need to regulate versus the uh
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
unique and very narrow tailoring of law
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a more fundamental
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
principle actually strict analysis
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny isn't actually a
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional principle it's a legal
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
principle based on Jud raal precedent so
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
no it's not based on strict uh that
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
analysis it's based on the
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
concept uh that you can find in the
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution for instance that you know
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
the same idea that requires us to give
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
somebody a trial by jury is the concept
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
that they are liable only for their own
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
actions and the people of of that that
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
they're a part of the community with are
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
the ones who will ultimately judge them
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
in that social justice takes a very
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
different tact and it suggests that
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
people will be uh judged not necessarily
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
by trial by jury but trial by media
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
trial in the public sphere where they
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
are presumed guilty instead of being
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
Presumed Innocent based on their
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
identity characteristics not their
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
actions okay follow up may I follow up
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you okay but you would agree that
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
this is basically health and safety
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
regulations on its face I would agree
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it touches on that but it's a much
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
broader and higher principle than that
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay see I'm thinking that this would
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned earlier that it
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional and I'm thinking
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
that this is if this is health and
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
safety regulation it basically gets
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
rational basis review which means all it
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
has to do is be legitimately related to
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
a rational government objective and uh
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically the standard of review
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
which um allowed dos to be able to be
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
carried the way it was and I'm
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that um it probably is
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional you may have different
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
arguments with
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
that we can cover that in executive
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
session representative okay thank you no
 
00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
session representative okay thank you no
further

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative TZ thank you Mr
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
question so you mentioned that um the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
existence of the office of Health Equity
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
and the other two entities is
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
discriminatory so do you have any
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
evidence of that discrimination here in
 
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.470 align:start position:0%
evidence of that discrimination here in
New

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes I I can point to the uh
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
policies that were promulgated during Co
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
that specifically took a certain amount
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
of of vaccine when was early available
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
new roll out was not available for
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
everyone yet and withheld a certain
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
amount of that not based on need not
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we know elderly
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
were most vulnerable so perhaps it
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
should have gone entirely to elderly but
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
it withheld I believe it was 10% at the
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
time specifically on the basis of skin
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
color we also had that same thing happen
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
with um uh the antibodies that were
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
available at certain hospitals for a
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
brief period of time follow follow so um
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
the office of the udman is who takes
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
complaints from individuals of
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination so do you have any
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
evidence of any individuals um filing
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
concerns about discrimination based on
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
existence of the office of Health Equity
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
given that the example you cited of um
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh the vaccine distribution was actually
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
court I'm sorry can you repeat what the
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
question was there so the example you
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
provided for discrimination was already
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
thrown out by two lawsuits that were um
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
found to not have Merit of being
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on the vaccine
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
policy that was rolled out um so I'm
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
asking do you have any evidence of
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination and a need for this
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
particular Bill thank you I I understand
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
the question now I would not look to
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
judicial president to determine whether
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
something is discriminatory or not I
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
would look to Common Sense to find that
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and I would say that we
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
can adjust judicial precedent in this
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
body by passing this law thank you one
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
more followup yeah so are you aware of
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
the concept of population he and the
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
institute for healthcare Improvement
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
basically being the world's leader for
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
how Health Quality can be Advanced and
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
they have said that there can be no
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
quality if we do not address
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
Equity I'm not aware of that specific
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
body but I'm aware that these Concepts
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
these Concepts that were promulgated
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
based on Marxist social analysis have
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
been broadly taken in the field yes
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you covered a
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
lot uh how this programs are
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but uh I wonder if you
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
have any data on the effectiveness uh if
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
we assume that the goal is uh to help
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
those who are in in need or certain uh
 
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
those who are in in need or certain uh
demographics

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
so when we look at identity like if we
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
close energy plant in a poor
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhood does it actually help that
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
poor neighborhood or if we uh Target
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
some um some uh ethnic or racial
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
demographic and deliver them uh vacines
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
that are not stopping transmission does
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
it actually help them so do this program
 
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.549 align:start position:0%
it actually help them so do this program
programs

00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
help thank you for the question so this
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
is one of those situations where despite
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is clearly some need
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
for regulation in the marketplace to
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
make sure things don't go Ary in this
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance it would be much better if
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
we just got out of the way because we're
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
actually requiring through the policies
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
prolongated from these offices
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination we are requiring that
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
people be treated unequally not on the
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
basis of need but on other immutable
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
characteristics such as skin color now
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
what you've referred to now within the
 
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're probably all aware
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
within the concept of medicine and
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
rationing of scarce resour ources there
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
will be circumstances where it is
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
correct and good to withhold a scarce
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
resource primarily for a person of One
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
race or another but it's not based on
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
their race it's based on their need that
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
is correlated to their race that's the
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
difference if there's a need there's
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's nothing preventing any of that
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
from happening but when you're doing it
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
on the basis of race without taking need
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
into account because you're looking at
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
it on the oppressor versus oppressed
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
hierarchy and trying to flip that that's
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
what this these programs do and that's
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
what we need to
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate representative T is uh please
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
remember that we're not here to debate
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
just get it information well I'm just a
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
little confused because can you share
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
your definition of Health Equity because
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
every definition I know is about
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
providing what people need based on
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
their individual circumstances such as
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities who who um uh
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
may need a wheelchair or people who are
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
blind who may need Braille the rest of
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
us don't get it but it's because we
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
don't need it so it is about providing
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
what people need so please show your
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
definition thank you I would what I
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
would say about that is it leaves out
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that it interprets that need on
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
the basis of group not individual need
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you so it would look at a person of a
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
certain skin color and say because of
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
historical circumstances or whatever
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
else is going on this group may have a
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
greater need because they're UN
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
underperforming in this area or whatever
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
than this other group and it will
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
thereby treat everybody within that
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
group under that Paradigm instead of
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
looking at them as individuals who have
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
an individual need which may or may not
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
Paradigm okay we do need to move on any
 
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.950 align:start position:0%
Paradigm okay we do need to move on any
final

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
representative uh Ju Just for the uh
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
everyone's uh information uh the
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
practice of this committee is to give
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor additional time the
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
the purposes of explaining the
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
background of the bill why it was
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
introduced and so forth but uh it is
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
also the practice of this committee to
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
ask that all those testify and keep
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
their testimony to three minutes that
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
allows not only for others behind you
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
the a chance to testify gives everybody
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
an equal opportunity and we do have
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
quite a few people who do want to
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
testify but it also allows the committee
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
members to have time for ample questions
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
of of you and and much of what you might
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
not cover in your testimony if you run
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
out of town time could be covered in
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
that manner so please be respectful of
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the time constraints and we will be
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
timing uh testimony this morning uh next
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
up to speak is uh the um represent
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%

Services again there's there's two of
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%

minutes a piece but
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%

Department's ability to ensure access to

all individuals requiring and receiving
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
Services Not only would we have
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities not
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
getting the care they need but also the
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
department would be in violation of
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
several federal and state laws which
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
would put the state at risk for
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
countless lawsuits and financial
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
penalties additionally when residents
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
are unable to access the care they need
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner It ultimately puts a
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
strain on the hospitals and Health Care
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
Systems leading to potential increases
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
in emergency room weight times and in
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care this is for critical
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals this this is for academic
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals this is for your large
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
tertiary Care Centers and all Community
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%

strategize with Community Partners on
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
how to best address these
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
barriers the leadership and staff of O
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
receive Outreach daily from constituents

the state who are struggling on how to
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
navigate our health care System the team
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
helps with the immediate need of that
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
individual or the provider advocating on
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of that individual but then also
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
addresses the larger barrier to Care by
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
commun uh convening with the different
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
Community stakeholders and
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
providers the barriers to care addressed
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
by o on a daily basis include
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation communication access
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
again for the DEA hardened hearing and
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
Visually Impaired hous housing and

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
care for individuals who are re-entering
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
our community after incarceration just
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
one more minute often a requirement for
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
release and and important to reduce
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
reism we Minimate the office minimizes
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
cost of healthcare system by helping key
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
individuals um keeping them out of
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
assisted living and in their homes by
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
ensuring the Right Care at the right
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
time in the right place at the right
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
cost very critical to saving money in
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
the state New Hampshire you could start
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please okay the last part is
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
um so eliminating this would would
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
disrupt the coordination of care across
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
the state and then the last piece is
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we oversee the 100% federally
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
funded Refugee resettlement program
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
which moved into the the Department of
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services from the
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
office of the government in
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
2012 um this is 100% federally funded
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
all these individuals are here legally
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
but the ability to integrate this
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
program into the office of Health Equity
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
and DHHS allows us to have the fiary
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
oversight of these federal funds which
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
allows for more effective and efficient
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
use of these funds and allows us to help
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
the refugees achieve indeep um economic
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
independence and self-sufficiency
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
earlier if the office were to be
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
dissolved we will lose this program
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
would exist outside the state government
 
00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
we would lose all control over these
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
funds and there would be a burden placed
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
on the municipalities in which these
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
refugees reside which are the major
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
primarily the major cities in in New
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so just to wrap up again
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
looking at communication access in
 
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal and state laws
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
our ability to knock down all barriers
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
of care for every single resident in the
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and to continuing
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
to help refugees um achieve in economic
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
independence as soon as possible thank
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%

chair and thank you for um taking my
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
question uh could you go back into
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
history when your office was created and
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
like what what parts of U DHS or other
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh departments were um taking were
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
helping with this functions before it
 
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.990 align:start position:0%
helping with this functions before it
was

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
created um the office was created in the
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
late 90s and over the last 26 years or
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
so different different components of um
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
of the office had been integrated into
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
that office for better coordination and
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
functionality representative Maser thank
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%

resettlement services that you offer and
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
that if this were to go away in your
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
department um what would happen are
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
there not other organizations such as
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
the international National Institute of
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire asentria ET Etc
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
international institution of New England
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the in asent are are are two
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
resettlement agencies in the state of
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are part of a na um
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
the federally approved Refugee
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
resettlement services so we contract
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
with them to deliver the services
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
required by the federal government if
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
the office um of refugee resettlement
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
was removed from DHHS or the state
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
government there would be a different
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
organization outside state government
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
that would administer those funds for
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government whether it's one
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
of those two resettlement agencies I'm
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
not sure or if it would be a different
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
entity that would be set up in the state
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that that would then
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
contract with those two resolvement
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
agencies representative Nagel thank you
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
question I think the hot word in all
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is that word equity um and I'm just
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
curious um so in the State Health
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
assessment and implementation plan we
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
thought that word was so important that
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
we spent two days discussing what it
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
actually meant and we came up with a
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
working definition and I'm curious if
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
you have a working definition that
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
defines what you mean when you use the
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
term for the office of Health Equity and
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
for this you know the Department of
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services we really look
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
at the word Equity equity as addressing
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
the health needs of every individual in
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
the in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
ensuring that every New Hampshire
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
resident has access to care whatever
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
that means for that
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
kofel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um following
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
up on representative maser's
 
00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
question um you indicated that if um
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
refu Refugee resettlement program were
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
eliminated within
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS then those Services would likely be
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
contracted with an outside agency you
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
also said that if that office were
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
eliminated from
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
DHHS then we would have a a problem in
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
which cities and towns would be taking
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
on the expenses and the burdens
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
associated with Refugee resettlement so
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to square those two
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
statements because it seems to me that
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
if the federal government were going to
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
be contracting with an outside agency
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
then it would not put burdens on cities
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
and to pick up the the slack can you
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
explain yes thank you um for the
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
question and I I did rush through my
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
last my last part in in that section um
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
so yes if if the office of the refugee
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
resettlement program existed outside
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
state government there would still be
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds for that program however
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
its existence within DHHS allows for
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
better integration with the the programs
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
in which these refugees are already are
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
legally required to receive whether it's
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
some of the SNAP tanif benefits are
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
specific to refugees um some of our
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid programs specific to refugees
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
and so positioned in DHHS it allows for
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
better integration it also allows us for
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
to use our contract compliance um and
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
fiary skills that and expertise that we
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
have um and allows us to better
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
integrate the services and program and
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
allows us oversight over these programs
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the funds are used
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively to help the
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
refugees achieve economic and health
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
Independence other
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative lontine thank
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
my question do you know of any rules or
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
policies at
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
DHHS that would deny anyone care based
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
on the color of their skin as the prime
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor has
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
suggested not to my knowledge no
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and um thank you
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um the the
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
three bullets that you've kind of lined
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
out here I I don't think uh anybody
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
would dispute that they have enormous
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
value um at least I wouldn't dispute it
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
um so but again following up on uh
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative L montine question the
 
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
the focus is not saying the distribution
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
of covid vaccines is or is not important
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
those things are all important so I
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
guess my question would be with respect
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
to the approach that you take
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
um how is there are there incidences
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
where you are going to look at and say
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
this community needs Service as a
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
community more and so we're going to
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
focus delivery on a community- based
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
approach as opposed to an
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
individual-based approach and I think
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
that was because nobody's disputing that
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
these three bullets are important the
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
the question is related to the approach
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question so if if
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
I understand correctly it's whether your
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
question is around whether we're focused
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
on one Community or another or the
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
individuals within the
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
community is that correct yes in other
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
words the the the concern of the Prime
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor was that in seeking to advance
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
the good of the community it is
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes necessary to subordinate the
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
good of the individual and that was his
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
concern and so what I'm just trying to
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
get at is your practice and how you how
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
you conduct that and how you ensure that
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
that does not happen of course so our
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
office the the part of um the office of
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
Health Equity that would help in that
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
part is really listening to all
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
communities and and and that's all
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
provider ERS all community members and
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the barriers within sometimes
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
there are barriers that are specific to
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
a certain region right we have a very
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
rural State we have a lot of homebound
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
seniors we have transportation is a huge
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
issue sometimes access to Primary Care
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
in the rural region access to recovery
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
so they might look at a community like a
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
geographically and say what are the
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
barriers to care in that region and help
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
knock down those barriers with the
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
community members and the providers but
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
not weighing one community over another
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
Community or one individual over uh a
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
different individual really convening
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
and facilitating and understanding is
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
there a Gap in primary care of doctors
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
is there a Gap in substance use recovery
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
is there a Gap in um case managers for
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
inhome care for those Aging in in home
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
so really looking at some of those
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
broader themes um at a strategic
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
level other questions representative
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question question
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
um sort of hidden in the middle of the
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
language of the bill it says um DHHS is
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
hereby director to dissolve the office
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity and is prohibited from
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
reestablishing this office or using any
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
allocated monies for any project labeled
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
as Health Equity can you tell us what it
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
would mean for the Department of Health
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to be prohibited from
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
doing Health Equity across all of the
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
um at this time we don't have projects
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
or programs labeled Health Equity we
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
have Federal funding and general and
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
general funds for different programs
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
that are specific to whatever you know a
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
grant comes in and it's addressing one
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
need or another and there's specific um
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
regulations and use U appropriate uses
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
of those funds but as a whole we don't
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
have programs or projects labeled Health
 
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.990 align:start position:0%
have programs or projects labeled Health
Equity

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
Equity
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
but I but I could follow up with that in
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
addition to social commissioner Landry's
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh certainly it serves a very important
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
function to make sure that the other
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
program areas um are aligned in terms of
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
any requirements under federal law for
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
administration of their their programs
 
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.190 align:start position:0%
administration of their their programs
thank

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
you one followup please so just um if
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
you could expand on that we the fiscal
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
note focuses on the cost within the
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
office that might be saved um but you
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
did mention that not complying with
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
Federal civil rights law puts a lot of
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
um money at risk because we are supposed
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
to all the department and Health and
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
Human Services programs should align
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
with compliance so can you can you
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
repeat or tell us like potentially
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
What's the magnitude of that
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
scale so I'm thank you for your question
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
Dr T is I'm not prepared to give a
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
financial number of what we we are we
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
have not done that financial analysis of
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
what the potential penalties are because
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
how what that would even mean at this
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
point I mean as far as the the number of
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
violations that we would incur if we did
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
not offer communication access and we
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
didn't comply with federal and state
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
laws but we
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
have numerous residents across the state
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
that are deaf and heart of hearing that
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
are visually impaired where English is
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
the second language they have a right to
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
access all of the information and all
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
the services and if they can't get the
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
information they can't access access the
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
service services and therefore we are at
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
Li we are liable um for for that lack of
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
care if you will for that individual so
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
I can't quantify it today
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
um and if I could add to uh associate
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Landry's um um answer
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
response back that the question is it's
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
posed is looking at the bill under the
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
for hunters of the document and an
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
elimination an elimination of the
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
program you know I think our goal here
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
today was to provide educational
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to make an informed
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
decision about what actually the program
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
does and Associate uh commissioner
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
Landry did a a very concise fine job of
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
doing it the question and flipping it on
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
the other end of it well what value is
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
it to the program as it currently exist
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost savings so for example
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
we know in long-term care it's better
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
for people to age in place so that costs
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
annually around 24,000 a year versus if
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
somebody has delayed services and
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
requires higher cuity care you're going
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
to be entering into a nursing facility
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the average cost of that is
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
$74,000 so there is many cost savings
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
that are currently occurring as a result
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
of the current configuration of that
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
particular uh entity within our
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%

to pass how many employees would be so
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
be impacted what what's the number of
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%

proposes to prohibit the department from

using any allocated funds uh for project
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
for projects labeled civil rights and
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
environmental justice the department
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a position on this bill
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
however we do want to make the committee
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the concerns that we
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
have um de is required to ensure
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
activities funded with Federal monies
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
are in compliance with the Civil Rights
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
Act of
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
1964 specifically we are required to
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
adhere to title 6 which is intended to
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit discrimination on the basis of
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
race color and national origin and
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
programs and activities receiving
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
federal financial
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
assistance if a recipient of federal
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
assistance is found to have
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
discriminated and Vol voluntary
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
compliance is not achieved the federal
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
agency providing the assistance is
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
required to initiate fund uh termination
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
or refer the matter to the Federal
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
Justice um so in in addition to that we
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
are required to comply with the ad uh
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
Americans for Disabilities Act as well
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's the Ada and so the having the
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
bill say we can't work on projects
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
labeled civil rights and environmental
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
justice would put s significant federal
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
funds in Jeopardy um we did give a a
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
range in the fiscal note of 80 to $90
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds and those are
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
for various infrastructure projects that
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
the federal government Prov provides
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
funding for um and many other programs
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
and and and other things that we do with
 
00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
and and and other things that we do with
the

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department um regarding the term e uh
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
environmental justice uh that's
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
a it's a long-standing term I think if
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
you asked anyone on the committee uh or
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
or anyone at the department what that
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
term specifically meant I think you'd
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
get many different answers um but at at
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
its core you know over the last few
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
years the federal government has had a
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
an emphasis on ensuring that the
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
department um adheres to uh some of the
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
executive orders that they have at one
 
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
point one of the executive orders uh
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
required for any discretionary grants
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
that 40% go to um environmental justice
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
community so uh and basically how we
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
label that as any disadvantage
 
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
communities low
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
communities um that executive order has
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
been repealed um so we are really what
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
that means for us now is just good
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
customer service and historically what
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
we've done is if someone asks for a you
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
know translation services for documents
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
or a translator at a public meeting we
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
we offer those Services uh as a courtesy
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
we we think that's good customer service
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
but that's at this point that's the
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
extent of what we do under the I I guess
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
what I would say the opes of
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
environmental justice um you know so
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's really where we're
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
at we we think
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
that it is a good thing to offer those
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
to anyone who who needs them uh good
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
example I know there there was a project
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
in naswa that had uh that was being
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
proposed in uh Community with uh a lot
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
of individuals who uh were not
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
proficient in
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
in English and so we did offer
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
translation services down there at a
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
request of uh one of the groups that
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
that represents that Community to ensure
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
that they understood what the uh what
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
the project was doing and and what what
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
what was being proposed there and so
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good example of how um
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
we offer these types of services we it's
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
really meaningful engagement in making
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
sure that folks can interact with the
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
Department um so with that I I you know
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions I don't
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
know if you want to add anything but um
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
I happy to take questions from the
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative mea
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
did you want to follow up the question
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
from before yes thank you Mr chair um
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
how many employees in the department of
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
environmental services so we have in the
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
department we have more than uh around
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
500 employees but in any program where
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
there is an individual who who works on
 
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
a project or a program that has Federal
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
funding attached to it we are required
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
to adhere to the Civil Rights Act and so
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
that is so it's not any one person
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
specifically that's working on uh the
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights piece it's it's a it's a
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
group of folks that uh throughout the
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
department it's not anyone's one duty
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
it's part it's kind of baked into the
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
duties at the department um in in those
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
roles on the environmental justice side
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have anyone working
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
specifically on environmental justice
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
what we do have is someone who does
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
provide and and coordinates language
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
access and as I mentioned those services
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
like uh providing translation for
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
documents um or information relative to
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh any any of the services we provide if
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
if someone needs it with a disability or
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
some other um some other
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
issue that they that that they're facing
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
so follow up yes thank you so I'm
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note where it's it
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
$100,000 with 500 employees it it seems
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
like it would be a lot more than that is
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
that correct in assuming
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
that so for the for the fiscal I'd have
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
to take a look at the fiscal note we we
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
provided an estimate for that one
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
person's position for that individual
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
who provides language access that was
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
specifically what was asked for um for
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
that as that's kind of labeled
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
environmental justice and that's and
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's what what that would cost on the
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights side it would be a much
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
larger um fiscal impact as I mentioned
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the order of $90 million potentially
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's the range of what the EPA could
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
look at and say you're not you're not
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
making sure folks have a pathway for um
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
you know if they discriminated against
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
you know one of our subrecipients for
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
example if they discriminated against
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
somebody uh you need a pathway to be
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
able to make that complaint and and we
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
do offer
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
that representative McKay and then
 
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.549 align:start position:0%
that representative McKay and then
representative

00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm not sure if my hearing was
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
correct did did you say that this
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
legislation would jeopardize up to 80 to
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
well what I what I said was they that is
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of federal funding that is
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
subject to title six of the Civil Rights
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
Act and we have to make sure that we
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
provide a pathway for someone
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
to um if they're discriminated against
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
under any of our federal programs to
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
make a complaint under that um we need
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all of our all of our
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
programs that receive federal funding
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
but also our subrecipients are adhering
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
to title six of the Civil Rights Act and
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
so that is the universe of funding that
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
if EPA were to ever or any other Federal
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
agency that were receive funds from were
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
to do an audit or some sort of other
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
check on whether or not we're we're
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
we're adhering to that that uh part of
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
the ACT then that those funds could be
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
in Jeopardy I that's just the universe
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's I I'm not suggesting that that is
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh likely to happen I but what I am
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that is the universe
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
that EPA could look at and say okay
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
you're not adhering to the Civil Rights
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
Act and that that's what could be at
 
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy depending on what what what
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
they find so thank you representative
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to clarify
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
when uh dhss testified that they talked
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
about the the kind of three-legged stool
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
that they have um within the um uh the
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity and
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to become law
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
basically that stool gets broken and
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
everything has to get scattered and so
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
they lose a little bit of that cohesion
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
um however with your department if this
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
bill were to become law um you would
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
still be providing translation services
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
you would still be if someone had a
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
complaint processing that complaint so
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
um really if this law was to
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
pass would there be any real change in
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
the way that you
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
operate on the environmental justice
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
side likely not on the Civil Rights
 
00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:41.559 align:start position:0%
because we we are not branding an
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
environmental justice at this point
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
because that Federal executive order has
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
been rescinded we it is a it is
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
merely just good customer service that
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're providing on the Civil Rights side
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
if someone were to make a complaint we
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
would not be able to process that
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
complaint because the text of the bill
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
says we cannot work on anything labeled
 
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.349 align:start position:0%
says we cannot work on anything labeled
civil

00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
rights follow up I think I got it thank
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
you okay other
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%

minutes uh thank you Mr chair I'm
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%

representing Rockingham District 31 um I
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
division three for the last um two
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
budgets now going on three uh I'm also
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
been a member of HHS oversight
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
and in in these five years uh I've had
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh an opportunity to speak with the
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
Department because the word uh health or
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
the phrase Health Equity has jumped out
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
at me as well and um I think uh we've
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
got a situation where whoever came up
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
with the name of that department really
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
regrets it uh because you they couldn't
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
forecast how the the name would U
 
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.670 align:start position:0%
forecast how the the name would U
basically

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
um become synonymous with uh actual
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh and not real equity
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
and and so I've been asking repeatedly
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
and been told uh each time probably five
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
six times in public hearings some in
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
private what do you do to run these
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
programs and what they're looking to do
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
it it was said break down barriers to
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
access they're trying to make sure that
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
those Among Us that are less um aware
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
culturally because they're new they're
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
refugees or they're less abled than we
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
are um uh they're they have less
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
proximity to Medical resources than than
 
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
most do uh th those demographic
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
populations that are not predicated
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
strictly on race
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
um uh they can be cultural they can be
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
Geographic it's whatever forms that
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
demographic that what they're looking to
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
do is to ensure um that uh access to
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
care is
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
equal they are not trying to make sure
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
they're not trying to have any
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
individual demographic get Superior Care
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's just a search to remove barriers to
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we all have an equal
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
access to care and uh of all the
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
programs they've mentioned I've been
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
pretty okay with them doing that I'm a
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
little concerned about the housing
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
program I wish I had a chance to do a
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
deep dive into that one um but um I I
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
unless they've been lying to me in
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
testimony for the last five years I I
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
would say that this is a program that by
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
and large um most of us can agree to
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that our our
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
citizens our our fellow citizens get uh
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
access to the kind of care that our
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
society expects we're not trying to put
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
the thumb on the scale to give somebody
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
Superior access it's all about equality
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
and that's why they've done things like
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
mobile Vans to go out into the community
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
to make things available um and so so uh
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
that that that's really what I wanted to
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
say is I I've I've spent more time with
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
this group than most legislators have
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
and and I've gone into it cynical
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
because I'm cynical and each time I've
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
gone into it with my cynicism fully
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
activated I've been comfortable that the
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS Health office of Health Equity is
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
is probably doing good work I'd like to
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
cut it a little bit because because we
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
need the money but but that's a
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
different issue thank you any questions
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
correctly uh also signed up to speak is
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
than joyle I believe it is from the
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
am I not pronouncing
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.189 align:start position:0%
um some of the
practicalities

practicalities
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
um and to try to put a human face on
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that we've already
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
one of the themes that
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
um one of the themes that was often
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
Central to our debates in this committee
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
during my six years on this committee
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
was the theme of building
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
self-reliance how many discussions did
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
we have in this committee about
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
providing specific benefits and services
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
for lowincome individuals or disabled
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
individuals or individuals with mental
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
health and substance use issues isues um
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
or people who just had a untimely
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
medical crisis in their life how many
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
times did we talk
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
about um whether the
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
said benefits that we were talking about
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
giving people um would they create
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
create more resilience more well-being
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
more health and more um Independence in
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
or would those same benefits
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
create more dependence and lock people
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
into a cycle of poverty and
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
dysfunction that was frequently what the
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
discussion came came
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
the refugee program within the office of
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.110 align:start position:0%
skills while immigration can be a
divisive

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
divisive
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
issue this is what the vast majority of
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
Americans say they want that newcomers
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
follow the rules that they learn to
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
speak English that they become good me
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
members and good standing in their
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
communities and that they work to
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
support themselves and their families
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
while filling very important
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
um empty jobs in our in our
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
state this is exactly what the refugee
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
program promotes this kind of
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
resilience um this kind of
 
01:12:22.199 --> 01:12:23.709 align:start position:0%
resilience um this kind of
um

01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency and if I could have
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
just another minute I'd like to just put
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
a human face on this program so in my
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um couple of blocks away
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
for me a family was resettled by A
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
family of two adults a married couple
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
and a 13-year-old son so when they when
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
people were evacuated from Afghanistan
 
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.550 align:start position:0%

more money back to Afghanistan for the
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%

thinking asking this question but I know
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
you well enough that I think you can
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer it one of the statements that
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard over and over again um has
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
been that you know you know historically
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
we used um private sector nonprofit um
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
ecumenical Serv whatever to provide the
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
services that DHHS is providing riding
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
now and some people are saying well
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we should be going back to doing
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
that again to save the taxpayer money do
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have um do you think the um the
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
structure in place that we can do that
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
in an in outside of the government to
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
provide those services in a cost
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
manner thank you so that this has
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
already been brought up before um and I
 
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:25.470 align:start position:0%
already been brought up before um and I
um

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
I did hear people say that the money
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily go away although
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
the money seems to have gone away any
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
case um but it would not necessarily go
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
away because of this bill but um funds
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
would be administered by private
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um what I would say to that
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
is that I think the Department of Health
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is better able to
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
provide oversight and effective ad
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
administration of those funds and I
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
believe that this is something that
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
our my government my state government
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
should be involved in because I think
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's really important and I think we
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
have a stake in
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
um bringing refugees to this country and
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
making sure that they become
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient making sure that they're
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
able to fill jobs that we desperately
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
need filled um and I think that state
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
government government is the best um
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
funds did I say a hand up over here
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%

Futures is a non um nonprofit
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%

policy change um new Futures opposes HB
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
392 and my testimony will focus on the
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity and DHHS a lot
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
of what I planned on saying has already
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
been said so I'll talk about a specific
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
program that um DHS helps run and um
 
01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
create accessibility so one example is
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
the 988 Suicide Hotline it has
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
capabilities for video calls for people
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
who are death or hard of hearing the
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity is key to
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
providing policy strategic guidance
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
training coaching and technical
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
assistance across the entire department
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
so the critical Emergency Services like
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
the 988 Suicide Hotline remain
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
accessible for all grand
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
saders um new Futures requests the

392 um and I can answer any questions if
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%

lives uh I'll Focus just on a very
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
narrow point because so much has already
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
been said that the office Health Equity
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
performs many valuable functions
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
among them it houses the state Refugee
 
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.430 align:start position:0%
among them it houses the state Refugee
Health

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator part of whose job is to make
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
sure that all new Americans have
 
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
received the necessary
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations uh that the federal
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
government requires and that also that
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
help keep all of us safe having the
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
refugee Health coordinator in
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS in close proximity to the refugee
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh makes good sense
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh we' got the health side we have the
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement side which is
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
primarily a an Employment Program uh
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
together they work effectively together
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and um I think for for that
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
reason alone it would be worth uh iing
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in addition to to all the
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
other values that that the the current
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
structure brings to the state of New
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I would just add
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
um as one of the really four or five
 
01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
major nonprofits that work with Refugee
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
resettlement having excuse me having
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
state government playing an essential
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
coordinating role makes a great deal of
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
sense uh it had never occurred to me
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
frankly that we might be Unleashed from
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
state government I don't think that
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
would be productive for us as an
 
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
organization or for the people we're
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
trying to serve I'd be happy to answer
 
01:20:57.149 --> 01:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
any questions questions thank you any
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative plaz off thank you Mr
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
question uh if you could uh help me uh
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
with the demographic that you
 
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
serve like there are some opposition to
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
refugees coming at all but also there's
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
a some uh conversation around who is
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
here legally who is here illegally and
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
in my view it could be like a spectrum
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
Refugee s who come on cbp1 S who jumped
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
through the border so if you could like
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh speak about who do you
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
serve all of excuse me because we use
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
these federal dollars we are only we are
 
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:47.639 align:start position:0%
only focusing on people who are here
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
with Federal blessing who have come as
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
refugees who've been approved by the
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
state department or some other
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
categories of of new Americans people
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
who come as humanitarian Parolees for
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
example from Haiti or uh as as the
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
people who are evacuated from
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan uh ukrainians who are here
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
through uniting for Ukraine uh my staff
 
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh we we're a small organization we have
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
seven full-time people they include case
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan from Democratic Republic of
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
Congo from Ukraine and from Haiti uh
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%

them are here as as they say legally uh
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
though I don't find it particularly
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to use that term but they're
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%

state of New Hampshire financially
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
policies that promote access belonging
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
and the common good much of my written
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
test Tony has already been shared here
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
today so I would also like to point
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
out that each of the structures under
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
attack in HB 392 has the secondary if
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
not primary effect of improving access
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
to stable employment for the populations
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
of granite sters including people with
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities immigrants and communities
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
of color by ensuring Equitable Health
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%

01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental harm and fostering
 
01:24:55.639 --> 01:24:56.910 align:start position:0%
Environmental harm and fostering
inclusive

01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
workplaces these offices help
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
individuals secure and maintain
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
meaningful employment allowing more
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to become productive
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
taxpaying members of
 
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
society this bill would
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
dismantle that and leave unnecessary
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
obstacles in place for these particular
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
groups of workers and also undermine the
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
state's economic stability by reducing
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce participation and tax
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
revenue I will also add as a personal
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
story that my son Forest is a person
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
with Down
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
syndrome and I can assure you that the
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
group of people with Down Syndrome
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
within the group of people known as
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
people with
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities do in fact face barriers
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
based on their appearance and
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
presumptions that they have no
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
competence to work or be engaged
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
citizens the offices under attack in HB
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
392 would leave
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
unaddressed the social barriers that
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
prevent people like my son forest from
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
being seen as valuable
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
employees to Granite State
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
employers from being seen as valuable
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
friends as valuable
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers I strongly urge
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%

good morning my name is Heidi trarco I'm

an attorney with the conservation law
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
foundation and with me here today is my
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
colleague Marina Voss who is our EJ
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
community advocate for the NASA
 
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
Community clf is a nonprofit
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
environmental Organization advocating
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
for clean air and water and healthy
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
communities and we oppose this bill and
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote and expedi it
 
01:27:27.719 --> 01:27:29.189 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote and expedi it
to

01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
legislate the committee's already heard
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
today about the critical work that these
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
offices do and so I won't repeat that
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and we are submitting written
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um but I think it's critical
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
that we just emphasize that what this
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill would do is remove services for our
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable residents in New
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's not just in our
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
cities it's not just nashv and
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester but it have impacts across
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
the state including in the North country
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
and in rural communities where access to
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
health services are often um very hard
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
to access there's a lot of distance to
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
travel and some of this work provides
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
state the committee heard from the
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
about what the EJ office does or does
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
not do um but I wanted to clarify
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
something that a clarify statement from
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's description of what
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
environmental justice laws are in the
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire really wildly
 
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
departs from what is actually happening
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um in
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
contrast to uh what he was warning about
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
the state has no environmental justice
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
law or cumulative impact laws and when
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
permits a facility they have said and
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
then their regulations prohibit them
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
from looking at cumulative impacts so
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
while there is a need to assess
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts and environmental
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
justice the department is not engaged in
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
that at this point and the description
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
that uh if a facility is shown to have a
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
impact on a certain Community it'll
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
immediately get killed that is not
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening in in our state and
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no state or federal
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
environmental justice law at
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
play what this bill would really do is
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
take a wrecking ball to the Department
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and the
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee heard from um Dees that they
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
estimate that it would result in uh them
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
giving back roughly 80 to 90 million
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
doar of federal funding for the
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
Department a
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
year is the Department of Environmental
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
Services in such strong shape that we
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
can give back 80 to 90 million certainly
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
not we know this not to be true the
 
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
department regularly testifies that
 
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing the best they can on very
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
limited resources and that there's a lot
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
of work to be done um they're stretching
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
their dollars so I believe $80 to $90
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
809 to 90 million a year is roughly a
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
quarter of de's operating budget this
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
would have great effects in de's work
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
well beyond the office of environmental
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
justice or the EJ work that they are
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
doing um it would impact our clean air
 
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
and our clean water it would impact our
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
permitting in the oversight it would
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
have far-reaching effects throughout the
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
way we regulate and protect our
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
environment and our natural resources in
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we urge the committee
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill and vote in exped to
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%

392 we have a strong history here in the
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
granite state of working to improve the
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
lives of individuals and families
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
affected by mental illness through the

work of community organizations state
 
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
agencies and the work that happens here
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
in the legislature through this work
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
we've made great strides in improving
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
access to care for all people living
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
with a mental health condition however
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have grave concerns that dissolving
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
the office of Health Equity could
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
jeopardize access to care for granite
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
Staters or will jeopardize access to
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
care for granite stors you've heard
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
specifics of the programs and services
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
offered by the office so I will not go
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
into those but I do want to emphasize
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
again that through the oversight and
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
assistance they provide to the
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
department and their contracted
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
providers which includes crucial Mental
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
Health Services they promote and protect
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
access to care really for every single
 
01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.070 align:start position:0%
access to care really for every single
Granite

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
Granite
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
stator simply put for people living with
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
a mental illness recovery is possible
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
but only with access to the care they
 
01:32:24.030 --> 01:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
need every day people go to work across
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
state to protect and promote that access
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
to care and that work has to continue
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
for that reason Nami New Hampshire urges
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman and
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for hearing my
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
testimony um I do have written testimony
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
so I won't repeat a lot of what has
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
already been said um the new I my name
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
is Isadora Rodriguez and I'm the
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
executive director at the New Hampshire
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
Council on development mental
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh the council is in
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill because of the
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh dissolving of the office of Health
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
Equity and we believe that the office's
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
work is vitally important to the
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
disability Community due to its focus um
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
on groups that have health disparities
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
so some of the points that I wanted to
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
reiterate are that this office ensures
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance under Federal stat
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
statutes including Ada which protects
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities um and allows
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
for equal access of information and
 
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
resources um the office has been around
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
since 1999 under different names um and
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
and I just want to you know voice my
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
concern uh that we need to have careful
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
consideration um to not blanketly
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate anything just because it has
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
the word Equity or Justice in it um
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
because um there there is a need that
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be met um and because of Health
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
disparities that exist for people with
 
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities those needs can only be met
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
through Equitable access um to resources
 
01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.510 align:start position:0%
through Equitable access um to resources
and

01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
information um and then my last real
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
point is that you know cour ordination
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
of care um and uh accessibility of care
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
is less expensive than siloed care right
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
and to meet in the needs of
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
individuals um we need to recognize that
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
um offices like the office of Health
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
Equity is looking to ensure that every
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
Granite stator has access to resources
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
and um Medical Care
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you any
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
Dary Mr chairman members of the
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh I want to give you a little
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
context quickly and I'm not going to
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
take questions in the time time fortime
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
expediency uh I am a doctor who
 
01:35:59.310 --> 01:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
practiced in New Hampshire for 18 years
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
I've now retired I'm the mother of a
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
special ed child and I'm an immigrant so
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
I cover a lot of the topics that are
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
affected by what we're discussing but
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
today I want to present you with a just
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
a big picture thought about medicine in
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
general in this state the model of Dei
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the model of meritocracy are being
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
presented as polarized approaches to
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare the debate in our country and
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
in our state it is about choosing one
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
path only one is superior to the other I
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
agree that both are necessary for our
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
population to stay healthy and
 
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
productive Healthcare is a foundation of
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
a thriving and competitive Society New
 
01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population is tough
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
independent and self-reliant by Design
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
despite that every single one of us is
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
impacted by the quality of the care we
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
receive in our weakest and most
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable moments
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
this is when we often have no choices
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
our lives and deaths will be in the
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
balance diversity in medicine improves
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
care and Innovation medicine is changing
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
very quickly a doctor friend of mine
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
says that trying to keep up with
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
medicine is like trying to take a sip
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
from a fire
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
hose I feel there is a danger that will
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
we will become calcified if our state
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
approach to medicine if we only pay
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
attention to who merits a medal medical
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
Ed education and who merits receiving
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the highest quality of Health Care few
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
agendas have as big an impact on the
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
health happiness and prosperity of New
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population I urge you to
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
vote to remain free and to live free and
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
die on our own terms New Hampshire may
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
never behave have equal access to
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
medicine but if this bill passes we take
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
one step closer to falling
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
backwards as academic and woke as Dei
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
issue it is a humanitarian issue that
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
has never been solved by Merit
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
alone New Hampshire live lives will be
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
visited by unnecessary suffering and
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
even lost due to a lack of protection of
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
our vulnerable citizens and by our by
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
our state government I believe New
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lives free and dies not just
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
on our own terms but on the independent
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%

closer to three would be would be
preferable

01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
sure good
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Wendy rooper I'm a
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
Guilford resident and I'm retired I have
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
truncated what I have to say uh quite a
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
bit in the essence of time but I do have
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
copies that I can make
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
available we are operating in an
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
environment of polarized views and
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
highly charged language words matter
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
when we don't understand or agree on the
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
meaning of specific words those wordss
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
can conf those words can confuse and
 
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.709 align:start position:0%
can conf those words can confuse and
divide

01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
divide
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
us when we are responsible for governing
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
and impacting the lives of
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
1il 1.4
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
million people we first must seek to
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand the meaning intent and
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
practical outcomes behind using certain
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
words only then can we make fully
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
informed governance decisions I believe
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
we are here today in part because of two
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
recent presidential executive orders

three New Hampshire government entities
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
proposed in this
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
bill just in the last week websites have
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
been scrubbed wording parsed or
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
documents taken down entirely in an
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
effort to be
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
compliant when I discovered that the
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
previous Governor's executive order of
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
2017 establishing The Advisory Council
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
had been removed from the State website
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
I asked Governor aot via email if the
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
values espoused in that EO and its
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
commit to equal justice for all are no
 
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.709 align:start position:0%
commit to equal justice for all are no
longer

01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
applicable and more importantly that the
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
concerted thoughtful stewardship of the
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
council in the area of
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination supported by state and
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
federal law is no longer needed I have
 
01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
suggested that the council be
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
re-imagined to support
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination efforts
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide dissolving the office of
 
01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:26.679 align:start position:0%
Health Equity and prohibiting its
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
reestablishment is baffling to me I
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
trust that the committee or sponsor has
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
had conversations with the relevant
 
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
Administration and program staff to gain
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
a deep understanding of the programs and
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
services administered and whether or not
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
they support Bedrock anti-discrimination
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
law have please startop wrapping up have
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
illegal activ acties been
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
identified I would make the same comment
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
about the dees Services have the
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
relevant staff been spoken to and have
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
illegal activities been identified those
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
folks have already talked about the
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
impact on federal funds let me remind
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
you that President Trump's EOS are
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:21.430 align:start position:0%
focused on
illegal

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
activities consequential actions such as
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
those proposed in this bill should not
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
be taken based on Words and an
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
assumption of what they mean but only on
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
fact-based knowledge of illegal policies
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%

saved programs to be streamlined I think
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
withdrawn or voted down until such time
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%

disabilities across New Hampshire I here
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
today to speak in strong opposition to
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
HB 392 because this bill is not just
 
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
policy it is personal it threatens the
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
well-being Independence and dignity of
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
people who already face enormous
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
barriers every single day people with
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities work hard to build lives
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
contribute to their communities and
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
navigate systems that were not designed
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
with them in mind
 
01:45:25.709 --> 01:45:25.719 align:start position:0%
many already struggle to access health
 
01:45:28.109 --> 01:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
care find stable housing and secure
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
employment this bill would strip away
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
the few remaining safeguards that help
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
level the playing field it would make
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
daily life harder for people who already
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
fight who are already fighting to be
 
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
seen heard and valued HB 392 is not just
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
about eliminating offices or positions
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
it is about the message it sends it says
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
that equity and inclusion are optional
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
it tells people with disabilities that
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
they struggles do not matter that their
 
01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
access is not a priority and that their
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
rights are negotiable this is
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
unacceptable New Hampshire can do can
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
and must do better a truly strong and
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
just state is one that ensures every
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
person regardless of ability has the
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to thrive I urge you to
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
reject HB 329 and affirm New Hampshire's
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%

already been said and I will submit this
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%

the society and its members elimination
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the health office of Health Equity
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
would impact each physician and

physician practice and patient
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire Physicians unilaterally
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%

patients um and our research community
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
that has done so much in this space over
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
the last few decades New Hampshire's

home to some of the best doctors in the

United States but yet we're know we also
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
know that our clinical care is limited
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
by the often times by the communities
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
from which our patients come 60 to 80%
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
of Health outcomes are due to factors
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
well outside of the role of in the
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
hospital or in the
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%

outcomes than others Health Equity
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
impacted my 7 4y- old patient from the
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
North Country uh who waited until a
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
softball-sized mass was bleeding through
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
all of his clothes to show up to see me
 
01:54:31.709 --> 01:54:31.719 align:start position:0%
because he didn't have a local provider
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
or any
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
transportation Health Equity is my
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
47-year-old patient who works six to
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
seven uh days a week for her entire life
 
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
and only came to me when she could no
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
longer walk because of the 30 lb tumor
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
um that was obstructing her Venus
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
outflow her only question to me prior to
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
our surgery um was when can I go back to
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
work Health outcomes also have an
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
immediate impact on the communities in
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
which we all live I I vividly remember
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
walking into a patient who just
 
01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
underwent a life-saving surgery he and
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
his wife were crying because they just
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
had to sell the farm that had been their
 
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
family for four
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
generations another patient of mine um
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh had to sell his business that had
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
been that he had had for 40 years
 
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
because of cost complications and
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
inability to uh uh to pay for his
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
workers strikes me every time I talk to
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
my patients oftentimes the first thing
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
they talk about is the burden of their
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
Care on their patients on their
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
Community their family their businesses
 
01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:32.750 align:start position:0%
Community their family their businesses
their

01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
employees so Health Equity is not some
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
straw man that affects everybody else
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
Health Equity impacts all of us it's
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
ensuring that um all in our community
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
have access um to high quality Care um
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
in fact Health equity research has shown
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
that policy that this that this uh state
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
has implemented
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
has eliminated disparities in rural
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
patients presenting with Advanced stage
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
cancer that's being published in the
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
coming months it also is the work that's
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
being done on the ground to address the
 
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
20 to 40% of granite Staters who have
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
food insecurity and can't heal from the
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
surgeries that folks like myself try to
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
provide in life-saving
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
Fashions um Health Equity is also things
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
like the Medicaid expansion that we know
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
stabilize the rural health health uh
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hospital Marketplace decreasing closures
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
of rural Health ensuring access to
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
everybody um and data out of other
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
states has shown that Medicaid expansion
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
improve the overall economy of States
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
finally I want to talk a little bit
 
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
because Health Equity and diversity are
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
very often conflated if you could start
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
wrapping up though yeah I will to clear
 
01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
to be clear both of them are critically
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
important I have to tell all of my
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of background that
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
we have delays in seeing scheduling
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
their operation that's because our
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce is so incredibly short up at
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
darkmouth and elsewhere around the state
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
up to 100% of population growth in this
 
01:57:00.669 --> 01:57:00.679 align:start position:0%
state is net in migration we need to
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
know how to work with folks from outside
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
of this this state uh and elsewhere in
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
order to increase the workforce so uh in
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
closing I would just uh strongly urge
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
you to oppose HB 392 uh I will be
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%

01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
so who understood that oh okay I am the
 
01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
only hearing person on my team and today
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to be a deaf person that
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
would be speaking with you however I'm
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
assuming you guys know that especially
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh meeting like this a hearing takes a
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
lot longer than an hour that is
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
typically expected an inter was only
 
01:58:55.229 --> 01:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled for an hour the servic is used
 
01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
for cart the captions that are now being
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
provided to my co-workers and to um we
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
have somebody else uh who is here from
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
Northeast de and heart of hearing who is
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
also deaf um are not high quality there
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
are full sentences being missed and so
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
there is not equal access today at this
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
hearing where you are determining if
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
deaf people should be able to access
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
their healthare now imagine and this is
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
common this happened before
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
surgery I have known people who have
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
gotten surgery on the wrong side of
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
their body because they could not
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
communicate with their doctors and tell
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
them that it was wrong because they
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the doctor was trying
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
to communicate with them either that is
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
gross malpractice and that is not equal
 
01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
access to um our
 
01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:47.719 align:start position:0%
healthare I urge you to think about this
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
as well 90% of deaf children are born to
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
hearing parents 90 90% of those parents
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
will never learn any sign language at
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
all I grew up in the deaf community and
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
I had a friend who I asked one day how
 
02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:03.639 align:start position:0%
do you communicate with your mom he said
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
I don't the only things I know is when
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
she walks in my room and goes like this
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
it means cleans my clean your room if
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
she does this it means come here besides
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
that she'll text me his English language
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
was not strong so he could not truly
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
understand what his mother or father was
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
trying to communicate with him I'm going
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
to do my best to keep this under four
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
minutes and respect your time and I
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you all so much for listening
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
to me and hearing what I have to say I
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
have spent $200,000 on an education to
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
be a counselor a clinical mental health
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
counselor the only one who was a
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor in the
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
state for de people my co-workers make
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
up the only service for mental health
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
counseling that is provided in sign
 
02:00:52.069 --> 02:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
language in the state I drive two and
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
half hours to see one of my clients up
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
in gorm because there's no other service
 
02:00:58.719 --> 02:01:00.709 align:start position:0%
in gorm because there's no other service
for

02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
them they already have a huge barrier to
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
finding the services that they need why
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
would we add another
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
one we are making a decision for people
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
who are unable to be here today and for
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities who are unable
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
to stand up for themselves how much was
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
this advertised this meeting for those
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
people to come and speak for themselves
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
and how much was it advertised in not
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
just English because English as a second
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
language is hard how many people he read
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
things and you have to like reread it in
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
English because you didn't understand
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
language it does not help anybody in the
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
community to pass this bill it hinders
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
them our Pledge of Allegiance ends with
 
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
in Liberty and justce for all where is
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
the Justice in this bill what are we
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
doing to help the people that we have
 
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
promis to help and support in our
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
country this is supposed to be a place
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
of Freedom this is supposed to be a
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
place of
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
democracy and I do not see that being
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
represented in this
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
bill if you have any questions about DEA
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
culture which I am not the person who
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
should answer even though that is my
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
undergrad degree it is the deaf people
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
that are currently here that should be
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
speaking right now it is the deaf people
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
here that should be answering any
 
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
questions that you have about how
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
drastically this bill will affect the
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
community I was a special education
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
teacher for a year in the state of
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
Maryland I moved here for this job from
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
Kentucky I displaced my husband
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
unwillingly on his part to be here I
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
will wrap up um I was also 6 years ago
 
02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
started interpreting so I have seen from
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
The Interpreter side side and I'm a case
 
02:02:55.149 --> 02:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
manager as well so I schedule
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
appointments for Deaf clients and a lot
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
of times they ask me to schedule the
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments because they have
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
too hard of a time trying to get an
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
interpreter a lot of times offices will
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
hang up when they hear that a sign
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
language interpreter is being used over
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
the phone because they think it's a scam
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is I do not know why this
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
happens it
 
02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
is that I could talk about all this for
 
02:03:20.069 --> 02:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
a very long time um but I was calling to
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
make an eye doctor appointment and I
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
promis I am wrapping up for an
 
02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
11-year-old client because mom who is
 
02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
hearing has had such a difficult time to
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
get an office to accept using an
 
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
interpreter and paying for one which is
 
02:03:36.189 --> 02:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
a legal responsibility of the office to
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
pay for that interpreter I had to call
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
three offices one of them flat out
 
02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
refused another one said that they don't
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
have the resources set up and I tried to
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
educate them finally the third
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
one was willing to work with me and I
 
02:03:53.069 --> 02:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
had to have a phone conversation with
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
their office in order to teach them how
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
to find an interpreter and that they are
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
indeed legally required to provide that
 
02:04:00.119 --> 02:04:02.350 align:start position:0%
indeed legally required to provide that
to

02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
somebody thank you so much for your time
 
02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.000 align:start position:0%

02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
me I can help you direct you to somebody
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
who is deaf and can better answer them
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
and share their life experience but
 
02:04:13.629 --> 02:04:13.639 align:start position:0%
today that was
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
unavailable thank you representative
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
navel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
taking my call you obviously have an
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
important role to play in this state

thank you for being here of course um
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
what happens to your job if this bill
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
passes um well my job I would actually
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
get more clients because it would cause
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
so much stress I have the one of the
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
only professions that if I do my job
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
right I will be out of a job I would
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
love to be out of a job but this would
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
cause so much stress the current
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
political climate the current way that
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
everything is happening is already
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
putting so much undue stress on on
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
people we have had clients cancel um
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
services with us because they're scared
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
of what's going on with the political
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
climate and that their services would be
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
continue other
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope you all have
 
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%

02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
on HB 392 FN before I close the public
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
hearing does anyone else wish to testify
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I am going to close the
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 392 FN and open the
 
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320 align:start position:0%

actually a member of this committee
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.559 --> 02:06:50.510 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
I filled out the pink card is coming
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
down oh yeah that was going to be my
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
next question it's it's weaving its
 
02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
way up to your
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
desk just that appears here good morning
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you Mr chair and
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the health human
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
services and elderly Affairs committee
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Mark mlan
 
02:08:19.229 --> 02:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro district 14 which
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
is Manchester Ward 8
 
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here to introduce HB 751 which
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
would create a lure process for
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
outpatient substance abuse treatment
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
programs by the Department of Health and
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
Human Services um so just a little story
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh early last year the newly elected
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
mayor of my city of Manchester met with
 
02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
several legislators uh from Manchester
 
02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
including myself and when we asked him
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
what he needed from us and conquered he
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
said he needed three things really help
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
with housing a clean up of the bail
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
reform law and pertinent to the
 
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
legislation we're talking about today
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
some kind of regulatory structure for
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment and this bill
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
is a step towards addressing that final
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
concern so why is it needed well um both
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh the mayor and myself neither one of
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
us are big fans of excessive regulation
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
but the city the situation in the city
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
and in the state as a whole in relation
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
to substance abuse treatment has become
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
unmanageable so the mayor of Manchester
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
as many of you may know is a recovered
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
addict himself so he knows the recovery
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
landscape and he as much as anyone else
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
wants to see people get treatment but
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
his comment to me when we were talking
 
02:09:41.229 --> 02:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
about this is he says look when we
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
release somebody from Valley Street jail
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
and they are clean we have a rare
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to keep them that way
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
instead they go into some black pole of
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
treatment um where the person who's
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
providing the treatment isn't even
 
02:09:58.350 --> 02:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
through their own recovery Journey
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
completely and so what happens is they
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
fall back into addiction and this very
 
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
precious opportunity is lost okay and
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's really what's at the heart of the
 
02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
problem and those comments don't even
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
touch upon the predatory behavior
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted in 2023 is the 13th Step
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
podcast the state doesn't even know of
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
the existence of more than half the
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
facilities that are out there they're
 
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
operating completely in the dark and so
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're really in a situation where I
 
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
think we need some guard rails the bill
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
originally came to before our committee
 
02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
last year but at that time the committee
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
rightly said there were too many holes
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
in it to allow it to go forward the
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
major concern expressed at the time was
 
02:10:49.950 --> 02:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
that lure might be so onerous that it
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
might discourage folks from actually
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
coming in and offering Services Services
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
availability may go down rather than up
 
02:11:01.229 --> 02:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
but you know because I was aware of uh
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the need that the bill addressed I asked
 
02:11:05.229 --> 02:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
instead of us killing it outright if we
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
could hold it over for interim study so
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee we looked at it we
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
eliminated the residential components of
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
last year's bill um to focus on the
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
outpatient only we Exempted non-clinical
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
services individual practitioners and 12
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
step programs from the need for lure
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
okay also we retained the utsman
 
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
position subject to available funding uh
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
contained in the original bill um you
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
know we talked in uh our uh our
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
orientation session early about the
 
02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
value of an ombudsman so you know
 
02:11:45.629 --> 02:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know for the elderly we
 
02:11:48.510 --> 02:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
have a right to know utsman and even the
 
02:11:50.430 --> 02:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board which was newly
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
created ser as kind of an edsman uh
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
effect and so basically um I think that
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
those have been very effective and
 
02:12:03.149 --> 02:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
persons who are using the services of
 
02:12:05.549 --> 02:12:05.559 align:start position:0%
these facilities are often at the most
 
02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
vulnerable point in their lives and so
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
having easy access to Someone Like An
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
edsman who can help them access and
 
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
resolve their complaints um I think
 
02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
would be of enormous
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
value uh since filing uh the bill in the
 
02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
fall you know based on the work of the
 
02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we modified the bill
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat and since then the HHS
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
department has come back and said that
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
they think that they can execute the
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
lure requirement more effectively by
 
02:12:39.149 --> 02:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
Rolling it into the existing Health Care
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
Facility framework than the separate
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
certification that we've been talking
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
about in the bill last year and that is
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
what you have in the amendment before
 
02:12:50.589 --> 02:12:50.599 align:start position:0%
you which I handed out before the public
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
hearing every body should have Amendment
 
02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:55.510 align:start position:0%
hearing every body should have Amendment
uh

02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:59.790 --> 02:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
22h okay and so that is what I I would
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
like to you consider going forward with
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
I basically what that does is that
 
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
substitutes the bill wholeheartedly with
 
02:13:10.109 --> 02:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment and what does the
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
amendment do the amendment basically
 
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
well as I said it keeps the edsman
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
position subject to the ability of
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
funding it establishes the licensing
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
requirements with the specific
 
02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions that I mentioned the
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
individual practitioners and 12-step
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
programs but instead of creating the
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
separate certification it rolls The Lure
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
into the existing framework laid out in
 
02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
RSA 151 colon 2 and appropriates the
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
money for a compliance officer who will
 
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
provide oversight and the thinking was
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
you know since we already have this
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure set up it's it's
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
going to be much easier to do it's going
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
to be easier to comply with and it's
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
going to be easier for the Department to
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
run and so they and they have come
 
02:13:59.229 --> 02:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
around to say yeah we think this is is
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
is a better way to go so I'll just end
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
by saying I know you know I know a lot
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
of you folks I know that many of you
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
folks are skeptical about new
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
regulation uh so am I but the
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
population that is struggling with
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
substance abuse I think they're often so
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
low that they're not not this is not
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
like going and looking at Yelp for a
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
good roofer and uh letting the market
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
kind of drive it these people basically
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
they're solo they're going to go where
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're appointed and they're they're
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
just not going to be doing all that
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
heavy research so I think we can help
 
02:14:41.709 --> 02:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
with this I think this bill is needed
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
and I hope you will support it um there
 
02:14:45.629 --> 02:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
are others who are lined up to speak as
 
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
well I'll do my best to answer any
 
02:14:49.709 --> 02:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have but bear in
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
mind that we I do have some folks behind
 
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chair thank you any
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
questions for representative mlan yes
 
02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.589 align:start position:0%
questions for representative mlan yes
representative

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
McCay thank you Mr chairman as a former
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
director of alcoholism for the State of
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a licensed clinical
 
02:15:10.549 --> 02:15:10.559 align:start position:0%
social worker would you believe that I
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
legislation representative mlay I would
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
believe you support it I would also
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
believe that you were invaluable to the
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.589 --> 02:15:28.599 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
question like in previous session I
 
02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:37.069 align:start position:0%
question like in previous session I
still

02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
don't understand why why we need it
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
because uh you spoke about predatory
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
behavior uh in some of treatment centers
 
02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:51.559 align:start position:0%
and that was the reason
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us uh uh in in a
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
previous session but for me the logic
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't match because predatory behavior
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
outlined in that podcast happened
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
exactly in
 
02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
certified treatment program so now we
 
02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
are uh pushing uncertified programs into
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
certified programs where this predatory
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
behavior was happening
 
02:16:27.310 --> 02:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
and with State facing all the L hes from
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
sunun Center that was certified I just
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't see how more certification will
 
02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
help with predatory
 
02:16:41.549 --> 02:16:41.559 align:start position:0%
behavior well I I don't think that the
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
the the intention at this point is is to
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
insulate the state you know against
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
lawsuits from predatory behavior the the
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
intention is to minimize uh the
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
predatory behavior so number one um the
 
02:17:00.190 --> 02:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of the facilities we heard
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from the department and the
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um the majority of the
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
facilities we don't even know that they
 
02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
exist and and so um while
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
individual uh providers within those
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
facilities may be licensed by the oplc
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
there is no um is no oversight of of the
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
facility itself and I think also um this
 
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
was where the the edsman position
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
becomes very important you know when we
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
when we look at for example um the the
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
right to know Ombudsman uh people would
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
would look to get transparency they
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
would run up against uh barriers in
 
02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
their towns and it it was very hard to
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
push through and and I think you know
 
02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
having some some one that I can go to
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
and I know what their role is even if
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
their role is they don't have any legal
 
02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
weight um they they can certainly shine
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
light on things and they can influence
 
02:18:05.469 --> 02:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
what ultimate decisions come so if you
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
have someone who is a clearly defined
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
position that that people can go to that
 
02:18:13.150 --> 02:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
understands uh the framework um
 
02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully the the the intention would be
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
that that would be helping to guide
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
better outcomes um so um I look at it
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
from that perspective I hope I answered
 
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:22.910 align:start position:0%
from that perspective I hope I answered
your

02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
question other questions representative
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
McGrath can you help me understand how
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
it works now somebody's getting out of
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
jail do they go right into one of these
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
treatment centers and who pays for
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
that um if if they get out I don't I
 
02:18:45.790 --> 02:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll defer it to somebody after me
 
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that um if if it's
 
02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:51.709 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that um if if it's
mandated

02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
by the court that it would be covered by
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
the state I I but but don't quote me
 
02:19:01.469 --> 02:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
because I'm not an expert I do believe
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
it is and maybe you can ask somebody
 
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
after me from the Department that might
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
know better than that I don't know if we
 
02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
have somebody here from the drug court
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
or not but um but I'm not
 
02:19:12.429 --> 02:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
certain other
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions I I do representative merer
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
question the office of the ombudsman so
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's something that does not exist
 
02:19:23.319 --> 02:19:24.990 align:start position:0%
that's something that does not exist
presently

02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
presently
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct okay follow up
 
02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
follow up so I I've had experience with
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
the right to know on budsman and so that
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
was not a great
 
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
process so I'm wondering if there's
 
02:19:43.309 --> 02:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
something that you can send us that
 
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
really lays out what that Ombudsman this
 
02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
new creation would be responsible for
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
and his
 
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities how he communicates
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
with people because we were we were we
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't email phone nothing so so if
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's something that we could
 
02:20:05.550 --> 02:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
see that would make this a process that
 
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
would make things efficient I mean I I I
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the the particulars on that
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
the position hasn't been created um
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
there was discussion during our
 
02:20:17.550 --> 02:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
orientation hearing that they have an
 
02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
utsman who works with you know people
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
who are in Elder Care
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh my assumption and it's just an
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
assumption would be that it's based upon
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
something along that model um but you
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
know I could certainly um when the folks
 
02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
from DHHS come up we could ask the
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
question but I'm assuming that it would
 
02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
be built upon that same
 
02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
structure other
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thanks Mr
 
02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
really appreciate all the work you did
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
on this you really deserve a p in the
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
back um you really gutted this bill a
 
02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
lot and I was wondering about the whole
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
section two where it talks about how the
 
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to establish rules
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
eliminated the reason is is because
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to be instead of creating a
 
02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
brand new certification you're moving it
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
right into the existing uh statute for
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility lure so um I do
 
02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
think there would still be some Ru
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
making that would have to be done um I
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
don't think it just is a cookie cutter
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
insert creating a new subsection G um
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
but the the amount of rule making that
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
would be required would be substantially
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
less okay thanks other
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
kofol uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um you you
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
have sponsored legislation that would um
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
open Health Care to uh free market
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
forces in New Hampshire by allowing
 
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
licensed Health Care Facilities to
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
accept cash only payments right now
 
02:22:09.469 --> 02:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
licensed healthc care facilities are
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
required to accept all forms of payment
 
02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
essentially would this if if it's moved
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
under licensed Healthcare facilities
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
would it then be the case that
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
um we we would
 
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
have um treatment that that would have
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
to cover would have to accept all forms
 
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
of payment including Medicare Medicaid
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh private insurance Etc or or would
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
that be would cash payment or would
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
would would cash only payment or free
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
market options be
 
02:22:43.389 --> 02:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
available yeah thank you for the
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
question obviously I'm a huge fan of
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
free markets and I do want to uh
 
02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
liberalize the HealthCare Marketplace
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
and so when this Amendment did come back
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
to me since they are rolling it into 151
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
colon 2 that was a huge concern of mine
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
um looking at 151 uh colon 2
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
the all payer requirement reply applies
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
to uh A and D and it explicitly says A
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
and D where this is creating a new
 
02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
section g um that would not be the case
 
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
so for example if you uh wanted to open
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
up a facility and you wanted it to be
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
cash only um because this new section g
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
is not covered by that it would not be
 
02:23:30.429 --> 02:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
covered by the all-payer requirement so
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would be I hear what you're saying
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I I and I I've already asked some
 
02:23:38.670 --> 02:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
folks about that very thing thank you
 
02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:40.269 align:start position:0%
folks about that very thing thank you
other

02:23:40.269 --> 02:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
you uh we are behind a schedule uh we've
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
had some important bills today and we
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
are behind schedule so we aren't going
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
to break formally for lunch but members
 
02:24:00.269 --> 02:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
are encouraged to go at their Leisure uh
 
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to continue the hearings right
 
02:24:05.269 --> 02:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
right through uh until we get done so
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
you want to go now you want to go later
 
02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
we call it a ring lunch and we will
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
continue to have the hearings and
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get caught up at some
 
02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
point so so I'll leave that up to
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
members discretion as to if you want to
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
go uh also signed up to speak on this
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
bill is Jen o Higgins and Dorian sharley
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
Services it is still morning good
 
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
morning chairman McDonald committee
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
members my name is Dorene shley I am the
 
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
manager of the Bureau of Licensing and
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
certification at the Department of
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
Services good morning I'm Jenny O
 
02:24:59.309 --> 02:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
Higgins I'm the legislative lays on for
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health at DHHS so the
 
02:25:03.469 --> 02:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
department would like to provide some
 
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
information relative to House Bill 751
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
we continue to expand uh substance use
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
treatment options and also to monitor
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of care for all New
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents um in existing State
 
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
Licensing or regulations are for
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
substance use exist under the office
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure they exist
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
under U the bureaus of Licensing and
 
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
certification as well as the Bureau of
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol services and our
 
02:25:30.269 --> 02:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provider enrollment so those
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
are some of the existing quality and
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
oversight um protections to make sure
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
that people who seek treatment uh that
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
treatment is effective and of high
 
02:25:41.309 --> 02:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
quality um this oversight bill here is
 
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
as already described by the prime
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh the underlying Bill had
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
focused on certification and in working
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and sponsors the
 
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
department was able to identify existing
 
02:25:54.429 --> 02:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
programming under our licensing
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
department so you will see in the fiscal
 
02:25:59.230 --> 02:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
note of this worksheet that you may have
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
with you today is on the underlying Bill
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that because the creation
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
of a certification program for these
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
substance use outpatient facilities
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
would be new the department was
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
requesting four positions an IT
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure build in order to do the
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
certification uh and some training
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
within our existing ombudsman's office
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
and in working together on the new
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh that Amendment would allow
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
us to reduce that fiscal impact
 
02:26:30.269 --> 02:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
significantly where the department would
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
need one position within our existing
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
bureaus of Licensing and certification
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
unit so that is a big change and some of
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we moved from
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
certification to lure to be more
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
effective in that existing oversight
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's overseas today already substance
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
use sort of residential treatment and
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
this would expand to outpatient as also
 
02:26:51.389 --> 02:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
previous previously noted the department
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a great sense of where uh
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
treatment is happening in the outpatient
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
space because we don't have this
 
02:27:00.190 --> 02:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
oversight so today we know that there
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
are 53 outpatient practices registered
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid at over 90 locations but
 
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's would be just those that accept
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and so the landscape of
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment is much larger
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
than that so the intent of the bill is
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
both to help us understand the landscape
 
02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
of treatment and have uh families be
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
able to know where they can access care
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
and then also to monitor the
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and quality of that and to
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
receive complaints and be able to take
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
action and as Jenny has already stated
 
02:27:34.349 --> 02:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder residential
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities are already
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the Bureau of Licensing and
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
certification oversees those facilities
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
the and Jenny's already mentioned the

questions no questions thank you thank
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
Peters good
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
morning uh please put your microphone on
 
02:28:37.269 --> 02:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
and you ask for five minutes please keep
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
it closer to three you bet um my name is
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
Kate and I'm a family doctor in
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester I work at Amis Health which
 
02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
is our safety net Health Center in
 
02:28:47.230 --> 02:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um I also Moonlight at a
 
02:28:49.469 --> 02:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
couple of our County jails so I'm very
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with substance use treatment
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I do a lot of it and I'm passionate
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
about getting high quality treatment um
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
in place for folks and I've seen the
 
02:28:59.070 --> 02:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
damages that can happen with poor
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
quality treatment because a lot of folks
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
end up unfortunately in situations that
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
are not ideal for their treatment
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
setting um I guess the piece that I'd
 
02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
like to add to what's already been said
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
is that in my estimation 100% of the
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
people who seek treatment for substance
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
use have suffered significant trauma and
 
02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
people who have suffered significant
 
02:29:19.230 --> 02:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
trauma are particularly vulnerable
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to abuse and to be taken
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of um I hope you all have
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
listened to the 13th Step podcast I
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
think it's really pertinent to this
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
conversation um and you know it's my job
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
as a healthcare provider it's your job
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
as lawmakers it's all of our job as
 
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
responsible citizens I think to advocate
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
for the most vulnerable Among Us right
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is why we put in laws to keep kids
 
02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
safe and keep elderly people safe and I
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
think people who have suffered
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
significant trauma like those people who
 
02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
are seeking substance use treatment
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
deserve that added protection too um so
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
over the years the legislature has given
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
lots of money for um substance use
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
treatment programs and I want to say
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's working I see a lot of people turn
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
their lives around and become wonderful
 
02:30:01.950 --> 02:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
contributing members of society uh who
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
take good care of their families and
 
02:30:06.510 --> 02:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
contribute to the economy um and we now
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
need to continue to make this investment
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh effective by putting in guard rails
 
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
you know so to speak for the pl
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
treatment places that are available when
 
02:30:17.469 --> 02:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
we provide good quality evidence-based
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
treatment for folks with substance use
 
02:30:21.309 --> 02:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
they get better um and that's good for
 
02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
all of us um so I hope that you vote
 
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this and help me in
 
02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
stemming the tide of the opiate
 
02:30:33.309 --> 02:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
epidemic right thank you any
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%

02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%

02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
Nel sorry I was just dealing with my
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
son's trauma um I just for clarifi
 
02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
clarification can you specify what you
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
mean when you use the word trauma sure
 
02:30:52.110 --> 02:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
well um trauma can be lots of different
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
things right it can be certainly
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
physical trauma like having suffered and
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
overdose and getting you know uh medical
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
treatment in ER or it can be emotional
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
trauma I think that um there's really
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
good data that most um people who end up
 
02:31:08.190 --> 02:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
struggling with substance abuse either
 
02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
have had trauma in their history that
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
has led them down that road or uh in
 
02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
getting involved with substance abuse
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
then they have suffered trauma um
 
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
emotionally and physically as a result
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:31:21.479 --> 02:31:23.510 align:start position:0%

services for the Alia health system and
 
02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
I am here today um because this was one
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
of the things that I'm very passionate
 
02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
about just to clarify um I a person
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
living long-term recovery 30 3 years
 
02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
from heroin and I got to be very honest
 
02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
with you that when I came I'm from
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh yeah um but when I came
 
02:32:32.349 --> 02:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
here 29 years ago I was a little shocked
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
about the current sud system and I can
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
honestly say that we've come with a very
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
long way but we still have a long way to
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
go um about four years ago I was a
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
director of The Bureau for dug and
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
Alcohol Services and really got to
 
02:32:47.070 --> 02:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
experience the state piece and what we
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
do with the treatment and now as a
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
provider out in the community and
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
serving for many years before that I
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
really am able to see what we're
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
actually currently working with and the
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
reason that I am so passionate about
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
making sure that this does happen is
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
because of my experiences at the state
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that I really couldn't do
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
anything I would get complaints and we
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
had no
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
oversight so what I decided to do was
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
really push this and I left the state
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
because I was receiving phone calls from
 
02:33:21.550 --> 02:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
family members asking where they should
 
02:33:23.230 --> 02:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
send a loved one and I got to be honest
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
with you if you were looking right now
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
today to try and find a place for your
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
child or your sister or brother you're
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to want to have someone having
 
02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
oversight from where you're sending that
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
person and this is really what what this
 
02:33:40.590 --> 02:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
is about um is making sure that we're
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
providing the best care for any person
 
02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
coming into treatment here um we've
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
received several complaints there have
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
been several complaints in the people
 
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
who know the best are the clients who
 
02:33:54.269 --> 02:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
are actually the folks who are receiving
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
these Services we've had programs that
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
kind of put 30 people in a group there's
 
02:34:03.309 --> 02:34:03.319 align:start position:0%
no oversight for this if
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
there if someone has a complaint they
 
02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't have anywhere really to go unless
 
02:34:11.469 --> 02:34:11.479 align:start position:0%
they are the program itself is receiving
 
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
services from the state of New Hampshire
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
so we really need to be able to have a
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
place for anyone who has a complaint to
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
be able to to look into it and really
 
02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
process it so that we're taking care of
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable population in our
 
02:34:29.269 --> 02:34:29.279 align:start position:0%

02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
also the director of the Bureau of drug
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
and alcohol services immediately after
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
Annette was so it's nice that we're
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
following each other again uh I am here
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of this
 
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
legislation it's a crucial step towards
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety and effectiveness of
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
our Treatment Services here in New
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as others have mentioned we're
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with very very vulnerable
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
populations who don't necessarily have
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
the means or even willingness to do a
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
lot of research into care they just want
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
care they're scared they're sick they're
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
done they want help they're not going to
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
Yelp it's not like choosing where you're
 
02:35:59.950 --> 02:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
going to go to dinner and right now with
 
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
no certification or lure for outpatient
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
facilities like we have for individual
 
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
providers through oplc or Residential
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
Treatment Centers through uh Health
 
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
Facilities there really is no measure uh
 
02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
nor is there a comprehensive list of
 
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
what services are
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
available we have made huge huge
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
investments in our system of care over
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years um since the
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
implementation of the Affordable Care
 
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
Act as well as parody and that system
 
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
has grown incredibly but we don't have
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
the means to monitor it to make sure
 
02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
that we are giving people the services
 
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
that they need I know I've heard
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill and stifling
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
creativity and Innovation I want to be
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
very clear that what this bill does is
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
it provides a framework of safety that
 
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
individual programs can then build on in
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
their own ways and just as we have with
 
02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and payer regulations now we
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
have very different programs that have
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
the but those same standards of
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
safety um I think most of everything
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
else I was going to touch on was already
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
discussed I will Echo anette's
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
frustrations with uh families members
 
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
calling concerned about the treatment
 
02:37:17.469 --> 02:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
that their son daughter is receiving and
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
really not being able to do anything to

help them that's that's a really
 
02:37:20.399 --> 02:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
help them that's that's a really
horrible

02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%

and advocacy organization we've been

working for more than 25 years to help
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
address issues around substance misuse
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
and addiction in our state I don't want
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
to repeat too much of what's been said
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
here this morning but I do want to
 
02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
stress our strong support for this bill
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh simply put we believe this bill
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
represents a natural and logical next
 
02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
step in the growth and maturation of our
 
02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
treat treatment system and it will
 
02:38:52.110 --> 02:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
provide qual important quality
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
assurances and P patient protections for
 
02:38:56.590 --> 02:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
individuals in need as others have
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
alluded to our our substance use
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
treatment system has grown significantly
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
in the past decade thanks to the work of
 
02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
many including many of you and and your
 
02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators there are now uh
 
02:39:09.550 --> 02:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens and of treatment
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
providers in our state uh providing
 
02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of of individuals and
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
families certainly we want to believe
 
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
that each of them prioritizes patient
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
care and patient needs and provides high
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
quality evidence-based Services uh and
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
and most of them and we believe most of
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
them do but the truth is we don't know
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
that that's the case for all of them as
 
02:39:29.269 --> 02:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard under our current system
 
02:39:31.469 --> 02:39:31.479 align:start position:0%
there's no the state has no oversight or
 
02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
record of many of the provider
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
organizations operating within our
 
02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
borders you heard the numbers there are
 
02:39:39.389 --> 02:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
53 outpatient provider organizations
 
02:39:41.230 --> 02:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
currently registered with Medicaid of
 
02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
those 53 the department currently
 
02:39:45.389 --> 02:39:45.399 align:start position:0%
contracts with only eight of them for
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
the rest the remaining 45 the state has
 
02:39:49.469 --> 02:39:49.479 align:start position:0%
no oversight Authority or mechanism to
 
02:39:51.150 --> 02:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
step in of cases of wrongdoing or
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
misconduct or substandard Services arise
 
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't even touch on the
 
02:39:57.230 --> 02:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of providers that are
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
not registered with Medicaid these
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
organizations are not registered with
 
02:40:02.670 --> 02:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
state in any way we don't know who they
 
02:40:04.590 --> 02:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
are where they operate or what quality
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
of treatment they provide at best this
 
02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
leaves individuals seeking treatment to
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
navigate an un uneven system that varies
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
significantly in the quality of services
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
offered uh this weakend our treat this
 
02:40:18.190 --> 02:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
weakend our treatment Network as a whole
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
and contributes to a rol involving door
 
02:40:22.190 --> 02:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
of patients who trans transition in and
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
out of treatment while they fight to
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
address their addiction at worst it
 
02:40:27.630 --> 02:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
leaves patients at risk of abuse and
 
02:40:31.469 --> 02:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
misconduct that threatens to to to force
 
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
them to relive the trauma they have
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
experienced and make it that much harder
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
for them to to get into to M obtain
 
02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:38.990 align:start position:0%
for them to to get into to M obtain
long-term

02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
recovery uh the amendment as
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative mlan mentioned would
 
02:40:46.510 --> 02:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
address this by by requiring Outpatient
 
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
Treatment providers to be licensed by
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
the state for further it would add the
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral health specialist position to
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
the embud men's office which as you
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
heard is just a critical component to
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
ensure that there that individuals who
 
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
are experiencing uh again misconduct or
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
wrong wrongdoing in within treatment
 
02:41:04.030 --> 02:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
have a place to go to report their
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
concerns and it's just another Avenue to
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
for them uh for the state to investigate
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
and make sure that there that there are
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections um where they need to be uh
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
in closing I would say that the state
 
02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
over the years has in you we have
 
02:41:18.910 --> 02:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
invested millions and millions of State
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
in federal dollars to establish a
 
02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
treatment system that that's capable of
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of our state uh it is
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know weaknesses or or holes in the
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
map folks who are not registered that
 
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
makes it harder uh you know for us to be
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
good ta good stewards of those tax pair
 
02:41:38.269 --> 02:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
dollars to make sure the money is being
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh being reasonably used um because it
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
it means people are receiving
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
substandard treatment which makes it
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
harder for our highquality treatment
 
02:41:49.389 --> 02:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
providers to ultimately help get them on
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
the right path and get them the support
 
02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
that they need so we think that this
 
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill is just critical in uh ensuring
 
02:41:57.630 --> 02:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
high quality services across the across
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
the state for everybody who needs it and

02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
good morning uh chairman and committee
 
02:42:33.309 --> 02:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
members uh my name is Amanda Vashon I am
 
02:42:35.630 --> 02:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
the coordinator for the Marat County
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
Recovery Court it was formerly known as
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
the drug court which is rebranded so
 
02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
those terms are
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
interchangeable um I have testified on
 
02:42:47.230 --> 02:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh all the versions of this bill since
 
02:42:50.110 --> 02:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's an Inception um
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
and that felt like a responsibility to
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
me I've worked in this field um of
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use disorder
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
treatment um for over 15 years um the
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
majority of that I worked as a
 
02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
corrections officer working with um
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
people uh from Community Corrections so
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
people who are out in the community on
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
bail or who were serving a sentence it
 
02:43:15.230 --> 02:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
also included folks who were uh part of
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
the specialty Court treatment so um
 
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
program so mental health court and and
 
02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
um drug
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
court uh the reason this is so important
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
to me and to uh the specialty Court
 
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
programs in the state is that we um end
 
02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
up working with the highest risk highest
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
need folks in our communities what that
 
02:43:38.269 --> 02:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
means is that without intervention they
 
02:43:40.349 --> 02:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
would likely recommit you know commit a
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
new crime um and their substance use
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
disorder would likely get worse they
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
also are the highest need because they
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a severe substance use disorder um
 
02:43:52.469 --> 02:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
previous testimony has included
 
02:43:54.030 --> 02:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
information about trauma and how
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
impactful that is to developing a
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um it is
 
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
pervasive substance disorder does not
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
discriminate it's across all genders
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
across all socioeconomic status uh
 
02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
across all
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
Races and so it's important to the
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
society as a whole that we do something
 
02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
to safeguard the treatment that we're
 
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
expecting people to participate in now
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
this bill applies to all treatment and
 
02:44:20.269 --> 02:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
not just the particip that I work with
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
currently as the coordinator of the
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
program but uh by the time they get to
 
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
us it's more than likely because their
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
substit dis disorder has gone untreated
 
02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
or has gone um had they've seek services
 
02:44:35.710 --> 02:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
for from providers who did not provide
 
02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:36.670 align:start position:0%
for from providers who did not provide
adequate

02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
treatment the goal ultimately is to not
 
02:44:41.710 --> 02:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
need specialty courts because hopefully
 
02:44:43.710 --> 02:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
we would provide a network of treatment
 
02:44:45.389 --> 02:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
that would get people well before they
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
commit crimes to the point where they
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
would be facing a prison sentence or um
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
participating in my program but we're
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
not there yet and so we have an
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide oversight to
 
02:45:00.030 --> 02:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have a Continuum of Care
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
that would reduce the likelihood that
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
someone's going to wind up on my you
 
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
know in front of me um for those of you
 
02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
who may not know what specialty Court
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
programs are they are a combination of
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh mental health and substance disorder
 
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
treatment that's aimed at um providing
 
02:45:17.550 --> 02:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
accountability for those who have
 
02:45:19.590 --> 02:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
committed crimes and who also have one
 
02:45:21.870 --> 02:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
of those diagnoses in New Hampshire we
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
should be very proud all but one of the
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
counties in the state has an adult drug
 
02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
court program we also have um mental
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
health courts across the state um and
 
02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
the recent data has shown um that we are
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
reducing overdose deaths by about 40% in
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
2024 we also will see the 1,000
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
participant graduate from our court
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
system in the state
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm here is is really just
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
because the 13-step podcast illuminated
 
02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
something to me that I didn't know about
 
02:45:58.990 --> 02:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
which was the likelihood that the people
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
I had sent to treatment over the course
 
02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
of my career um were statistically it
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
was possible that they were victimized
 
02:46:07.469 --> 02:46:07.479 align:start position:0%
when they went to treatment and to me
 
02:46:09.630 --> 02:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
that was unacceptable I lost sleep over
 
02:46:11.469 --> 02:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
that and I feel like I have to be here
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
to be a voice for those people who we
 
02:46:15.870 --> 02:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
are mandating in some cases to go to
 
02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
these treatment centers okay thank Youk
 
02:46:20.590 --> 02:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
you any
 
02:46:23.710 --> 02:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon thank you
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you uh for taking my
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
question and I apologize if you said
 
02:46:30.870 --> 02:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
this and I didn't quite understand it
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
but how when you re does the court
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
contract with particular treatment
 
02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
centers now or how do you make the
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
referral where do you currently get your
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
information about what programs to refer
 
02:46:48.550 --> 02:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
people to you mean before they come to
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
our program or after they've already
 
02:46:53.070 --> 02:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
accepted a
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
sentence um I guess anywhere in the
 
02:46:58.269 --> 02:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
process I don't really okay I'll try to
 
02:47:01.710 --> 02:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
quickly summ so um someone who commits a
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
crime um most often they're uh drug
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
related or drug related adjacent um they
 
02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
would be uh referred oftentimes by their
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
defense attorney to apply for the
 
02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
program so these programs are voluntary
 
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
up until the point that they're
 
02:47:18.150 --> 02:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
sentenced then they become mandated so
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
they have to do what the court is asking
 
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
them to after that point but the process
 
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
to get into these programs is twofold
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
they have to be assessed by a licensed
 
02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
clinician to determine they have a sub
 
02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
disorder and they also have to be
 
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
assessed by a trained um professional to
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
determine their risk level and they have
 
02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
to be high risk to participate once they
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
come into the program the clinical
 
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
assessment that they obtained when they
 
02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
were deemed appropriate is then used to
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
determine the level of care that they
 
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
would need to be in sometimes that means
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
they come out of this the jail system to
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh right into an inpatient bed sometimes
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
it means they come right out to
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient services through for example
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
Riverbend which is where I work um as
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
part of a program but over the course of
 
02:48:05.269 --> 02:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
time level of care can change because uh
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
addiction is a relapsing Condition it's
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
chronic and so over time they may
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
struggle we reassess their level of care
 
02:48:14.910 --> 02:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
they go to a different treatment center
 
02:48:17.190 --> 02:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
and come back to us so the Continuum of
 
02:48:19.150 --> 02:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
Care is very important to the SU ESS of
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
our participants over
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
time other
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
enough also signed up to speak is Cheryl
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
is I pronounce that correctly you know
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
job yeah my name is Cheryl pelli and I
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
am also a person in long-term recovery
 
02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
for 35 plus years and I am speaking in
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I concur with
 
02:49:08.469 --> 02:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
everything everybody said already but
 
02:49:10.990 --> 02:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
now I want to tell you a story about
 
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
what is currently happening right now
 
02:49:18.229 --> 02:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
today as we sit here with zero oversight
 
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
for these programs on Monday as a person
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
in long-term recovery for a for a long
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
time I get calls from all kinds of
 
02:49:29.070 --> 02:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
people family members where can I send
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
my son daughter to treatment and I also
 
02:49:36.110 --> 02:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
get calls about this happened where I
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
work who can I tell what's the process
 
02:49:42.750 --> 02:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
to make a complaint and this woman who
 
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
called me is in her early 20s she works
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
at a Outpatient Treatment Center
 
02:49:52.590 --> 02:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
and her boss who was the
 
02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.110 align:start position:0%
and her boss who was the
director

02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
director
 
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
um solicited um inappropriate sex from
 
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
her and she doesn't know who to tell
 
02:50:04.830 --> 02:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
that to there's no oversight for this
 
02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
she went to her boss the person
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately got fired and when that
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
happened she took over all of his
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
clients five other women have said the
 
02:50:22.110 --> 02:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
exact same thing happened to them again
 
02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
no one to tell no oversight nobody to
 
02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
make sure where he's going to work next
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
which he is already working somewhere in
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
conquered it's not going to happen to
 
02:50:40.389 --> 02:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
another woman so again I would urge you
 
02:50:44.269 --> 02:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
to support this bill for those reasons
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
and it has been mentioned before if you
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
have not listen listen to The 13th Step
 
02:50:53.070 --> 02:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
podcast I would download it to your
 
02:50:57.349 --> 02:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
phone on the way home this is real women
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
in treatment are being abused over and
 
02:51:05.469 --> 02:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
over and over and we are not doing
 
02:51:09.309 --> 02:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
anything about it I have been
 
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
trying to work on getting this done for
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
11 years this is the closest like I have
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
come and it is in your hands now to help
 
02:51:25.229 --> 02:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
to move this legislation forward and I
 
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
have written like professional testimony
 
02:51:31.309 --> 02:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
sure but um I just wanted you to know
 
02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
like this is actively happening today
 
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
and I am trying to help this woman know
 
02:51:41.030 --> 02:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
what to do so and I'd be happy to answer
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr uh chair and thank
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
you for sharing with us and taking my
 
02:51:57.790 --> 02:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
question so I'm trying to understand uh
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
obviously uh very concerning situation
 
02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to understand if this
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill will help or makes it worse
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
because uh uh you are speaking about
 
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
individual who who was abusive and now
 
02:52:20.190 --> 02:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
he is in different uh facility
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
but uh I think Bill if I'm not mistaken
 
02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:27.190 align:start position:0%
but uh I think Bill if I'm not mistaken
speaks

02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
speaks
 
02:52:31.710 --> 02:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
about uh about facility itself and
 
02:52:36.229 --> 02:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
facility is now in is in good hands so
 
02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
going after facility maybe not the right
 
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
approach in in the situation that you
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
described so in my way of thinking and I
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
could be way off off but if in fact I
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
was a woman in that treatment center and
 
02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
this was happening to me that I would
 
02:52:58.429 --> 02:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
call the office of the Ombudsman and
 
02:53:01.750 --> 02:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
report it and then what they do with it
 
02:53:05.229 --> 02:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
I would hope they would investigate look
 
02:53:08.510 --> 02:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
into it and find out what's going on
 
02:53:10.830 --> 02:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
make sure the director of that facility
 
02:53:15.150 --> 02:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
knows like we had five women say that
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
this person is um you know taking
 
02:53:22.229 --> 02:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
advantage of us and right now there's no
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
place for that to
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%

key hi my name's Mar Kylie and I live in
 
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth New Hampshire thank you for
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
allowing me the time to testify I'm I'm
 
02:54:14.990 --> 02:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
here today in support of House Bill
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
751 and I'm supporting this bill because
 
02:54:21.550 --> 02:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
my son my only child Ben and this is his
 
02:54:25.429 --> 02:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
picture died suddenly and
 
02:54:29.349 --> 02:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly from alcohol on October
 
02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
24th 2023 which is 15 months ago and um
 
02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
he was only 44 years old and um I never
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
saw him drink and neither did my whole
 
02:54:43.309 --> 02:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
family he he worked full-time and he had
 
02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
lots of friends and he was very close to
 
02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
his family and um his friends knew he
 
02:54:51.389 --> 02:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
had a problem with alcohol and um they
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
just didn't know how to help him and I I
 
02:54:56.590 --> 02:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
appreciated hearing um that this bill
 
02:54:59.229 --> 02:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
people talk about this bill is going to
 
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
allow people to be able to more easily
 
02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
navigate the system and find treatment
 
02:55:08.110 --> 02:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
because um and someone mentioned I think
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor mentioned that and others
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
that the people people and their
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
families are a really vulnerable when
 
02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
this is going on and it's not an easy
 
02:55:18.990 --> 02:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
process to find quality
 
02:55:23.309 --> 02:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
treatment so um my son um I didn't know
 
02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
that he had relapsed he this picture was
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
taken on Mother's Day 2023 and that was
 
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
5 months before he died and um we were
 
02:55:33.190 --> 02:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
out hiking he loved nature he loved to
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
go hiking and he he was sober then I
 
02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
didn't know he would he had relapsed so
 
02:55:41.309 --> 02:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
it was a shock in October when I
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
received the call from the hospital that
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
he'd had a cardiac arrest and uh it was
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
3: in the morning and he never regained
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
consciousness and he died a few hours
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
later and um my sister-in-law was there
 
02:55:55.990 --> 02:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
with me at the hospital and um she said
 
02:55:57.790 --> 02:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
this is just shocking she's like he's
 
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
the picture of health and and I I kept
 
02:56:02.229 --> 02:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
looking at him and saying to the doctors
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
look at him he doesn't have a line on
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
his face he his beard is so trimmed his
 
02:56:08.830 --> 02:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
fingernails he's so healthy how could
 
02:56:12.150 --> 02:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
this happen and a doctor told me that um
 
02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know I'm like but he's so young and
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
he's so healthy and he just said you
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
know for your son alcohol was poison
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
and um he said I don't we don't know why
 
02:56:24.030 --> 02:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
some people are in their 70s and they're
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
in and out of detox and they're back
 
02:56:29.110 --> 02:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
here and but he said not for your son so
 
02:56:31.389 --> 02:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
Ben had voluntarily attended substance
 
02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
use treatment centers four times in the
 
02:56:35.710 --> 02:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
six years before his death that's when
 
02:56:37.269 --> 02:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
we found out that he had alcohol use
 
02:56:38.590 --> 02:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
disorder like I said we never saw him
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
drink but you know six years ago six
 
02:56:43.269 --> 02:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
years before his death he was diagnosed
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
with alcohol use disorder and he was
 
02:56:47.910 --> 02:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
very open about it with us and he badly
 
02:56:50.110 --> 02:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
wanted wanted to stop drinking and
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the treatment senses that
 
02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
he attended did not provide
 
02:56:55.950 --> 02:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment something that
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize at the time and he
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
didn't realize and he did tell them you
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
know after the first treatment center
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
and when they sent him he was he was
 
02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
referred we and we we talked to the
 
02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they referred him to these
 
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
facilities I don't think they knew that
 
02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
they weren't evidence-based and he had
 
02:57:14.269 --> 02:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
told them after the first one I need
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
more Medical Care sorry I'll keep this
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
short um but he didn't receive it so he
 
02:57:22.110 --> 02:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
did not receive evidence-based treatment
 
02:57:24.269 --> 02:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
and I I think that this bill will help
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that happens that the
 
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
facilities need to meet standards have
 
02:57:32.429 --> 02:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
qualified staff and um provide
 
02:57:37.349 --> 02:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment and um also um
 
02:57:39.389 --> 02:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that we and the other
 
02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
families that were um had their family
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
members there received outdated and
 
02:57:46.110 --> 02:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
harmful advice from the center staff who
 
02:57:48.429 --> 02:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
lack the qualifications to advise Ames
 
02:57:51.030 --> 02:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
we attended the family meetings and the
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
advice that we got on what how to help
 
02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
our families was very outdated and very
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
harmful and um so I I think that this
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
bill will help to ensure that there are
 
02:58:04.150 --> 02:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
a qualified staff there that are meeting
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
standards and Ben was very intelligent
 
02:58:09.550 --> 02:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
kind caring he always worked full-time
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
he had so many interests he loved
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
history and literature he loved to read
 
02:58:15.950 --> 02:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
and write screenplays he was funny and
 
02:58:17.950 --> 02:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
creative he was just a wonderful son he
 
02:58:19.630 --> 02:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
was was a gift I used to tell him he was
 
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
the joy of my life and I miss him every
 
02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
single day and I'm just so sad that he
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
lost his beautiful life needlessly and I
 
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
I've since learned that alcohol use
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
disorder is highly treatable and I
 
02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
believe Ben would be alive today if he
 
02:58:33.910 --> 02:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
had received the evidence-based
 
02:58:35.830 --> 02:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
treatment that he wanted and
 
02:58:38.469 --> 02:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
needed um and he was so full of life
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
that I saw him losing hope that he could
 
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
recover so I ask you to support this
 
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill for the many people like Ben who
 
02:58:46.870 --> 02:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
are struggling to recover from addiction
 
02:58:48.429 --> 02:58:48.439 align:start position:0%
and for their families and friends who
 
02:58:50.590 --> 02:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
were also desperate to help them so
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you ma'am
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%

02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:09.000 align:start position:0%

02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%

representative Merchant um
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
would helped me draft this bill with
 
03:03:56.429 --> 03:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
Senator um Rosenwald so what what you're
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
looking at is the evolution in
 
03:04:01.710 --> 03:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
understanding how the prescription drug
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
affordability board ought to operate it
 
03:04:07.550 --> 03:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
first got put into legislation about
 
03:04:10.870 --> 03:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
four years ago maybe five years ago um
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
it had some Concepts at the time that it
 
03:04:15.229 --> 03:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
was going to be pretty autonomous in
 
03:04:17.349 --> 03:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the its data collection and
 
03:04:21.389 --> 03:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
data storage and its ability to um uh do
 
03:04:24.110 --> 03:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
data calls to ask industry to provide
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
direct answers to them that they would
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
provide privacy and security around um
 
03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
there so so so what has happened is uh
 
03:04:37.469 --> 03:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
uh having had an opportunity to operate
 
03:04:39.229 --> 03:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
the board a while and figure out what
 
03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
the real ways of working should be it's
 
03:04:46.830 --> 03:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
been determined that that we think um
 
03:04:48.229 --> 03:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the board
 
03:04:50.910 --> 03:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh ought to rely on the data that's
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
already being accumulated by other
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
departments and to rely on them to to do
 
03:04:59.910 --> 03:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
all the data warehousing and managing
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
and that the pdab will become
 
03:05:06.190 --> 03:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
essentially uh an entity a customer to
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
request uh access to particular data to
 
03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
run a particular report and only run the
 
03:05:15.429 --> 03:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
reports that have been developed in
 
03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
concert with um the entities of the
 
03:05:20.670 --> 03:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
state that purchase our prescription
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
drugs so we're supposed to be in touch
 
03:05:27.710 --> 03:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
with those uh entities that buy drugs on
 
03:05:30.349 --> 03:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers behalf figure out what
 
03:05:32.229 --> 03:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
kind of information they need in order
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
for them to make better informed
 
03:05:36.429 --> 03:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
decisions to use the transparency of
 
03:05:38.190 --> 03:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
information for them to drive better
 
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
drug prices that's the general principle
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the board um and what this bill does
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
is in several places it puts us in the
 
03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
statute like in the on the first page uh
 
03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
section 21 on down it talks about um
 
03:05:58.990 --> 03:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh identifying the report before they
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
start to seek the data then on line 28
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
it starts to talk about um collaboration
 
03:06:09.229 --> 03:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
between departments using M us it talks
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
about uh cost sharing with those
 
03:06:13.710 --> 03:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
departments so that if extra work is
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
required money is made available it
 
03:06:20.190 --> 03:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
talks about uh in uh on page two line
 
03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
five uh the the methodology for making a
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
data call uh line 11 is due process so
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
that if a data request is made that's
 
03:06:33.870 --> 03:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
onerous um that uh the uh that industry
 
03:06:36.510 --> 03:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to contest the
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
request um before providing the data um
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
and uh on page three I'm going through
 
03:06:51.229 --> 03:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
it a little quickly um we uh there's a
 
03:06:54.910 --> 03:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
section in here um that talks about how
 
03:06:58.110 --> 03:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
the board is supposed to provide value
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
and what kinds of information it can
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
look to we added to that uh line 25 and
 
03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
26 basically saying that the board ought
 
03:07:10.990 --> 03:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
to have um situational awareness of what
 
03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
other pabs around the country are doing
 
03:07:15.710 --> 03:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
what the feds are doing so we can just
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
leverage other good ideas instead of
 
03:07:19.870 --> 03:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
thinking we have to make them up
 
03:07:24.349 --> 03:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
ourselves next page um it again we're on
 
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
situational awareness then we get to uh
 
03:07:31.630 --> 03:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
how we can f um Levy fees if uh if um
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
companies do not comply with a a valid
 
03:07:38.349 --> 03:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
data request um we limit our own access
 
03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
to the data to only those who are
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
qualified and with a need to know within
 
03:07:42.160 --> 03:07:43.070 align:start position:0%
qualified and with a need to know within
the

03:07:43.070 --> 03:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
board um sometimes we may ask for
 
03:07:48.349 --> 03:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
business sensitive data and that's what
 
03:07:51.229 --> 03:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
the lines 34 on that page do is to just
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
say that we should be aware of business
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
sensitive data next page five is a
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
quality uh statement so that if we
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
collect data we're collecting good
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
quality data and that way any data that
 
03:08:09.070 --> 03:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
we do uh uh collect can then be useful
 
03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
to others and not just to our own
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
purposes so uh so that's that's what the
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill does there's a fiscal note on it
 
03:08:22.510 --> 03:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
um and um uh I I think this is uh this
 
03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is an effort to do some good
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
government the
 
03:08:30.670 --> 03:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
board operation ought to mature uh and
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh directs a good way
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
in which it can be done in a sort of a
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan or bipartisan way and with
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions I have one to start off with
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
is there an amend Amendment pending on
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
this I had a rumor or um I I do not I I
 
03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
understand um the Edna committee uh
 
03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
after they heard the other half of this
 
03:09:04.349 --> 03:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
bill um that their committee is talking
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
about another amendment but I don't have
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
anything official on that okay thank you
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
Kofa yes so so can you um offer any
 
03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
insights into how much uh what what is
 
03:09:22.590 --> 03:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
the budget I was I was looking at um
 
03:09:24.429 --> 03:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
some slides online and it looks like the
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
budget request for the next two years is
 
03:09:30.670 --> 03:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
around 1.2 million for the for the board
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
is that accurate or am I well uh I I am
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
aware of the agency budget request for
 
03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
and and I remember it in the first year
 
03:09:43.389 --> 03:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
$257,000 um and um and that that's
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's in the budget and then this
 
03:09:52.830 --> 03:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note thinks that uh there would
 
03:09:55.229 --> 03:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
be some potential for Revenue a little
 
03:09:57.990 --> 03:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
bit and um some additional expenses
 
03:10:02.590 --> 03:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
related to the data calls so if um so
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
another appropriation would probably
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
need to be made to support the data call
 
03:10:11.469 --> 03:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
part of this and so it could go from a
 
03:10:13.309 --> 03:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
quar million to about
 
03:10:15.630 --> 03:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
$350,000 a
 
03:10:19.830 --> 03:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
year does that answer your question uh
 
03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
it does followup followup um so and are
 
03:10:24.309 --> 03:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
you aware of I mean so in addition to
 
03:10:25.710 --> 03:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
the sort of the hard dollars are there
 
03:10:28.990 --> 03:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
soft costs associated with the board I
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
mean are there for example um agency
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel or Personnel from other
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
agencies that are contributing
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of time that that
 
03:10:39.070 --> 03:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be considered as a factor in
 
03:10:41.309 --> 03:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
the the overall cost here the amount of
 
03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
time that I'm aware of is um in the
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
because this is attached
 
03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
03:10:52.269 --> 03:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
DHHS and and I and I and I think it's
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that in the last year or
 
03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
um about 120 manh hours 100 to 120 man
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
hours it's a rough estimate it's not
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
been documented but uh it it feels like
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
an additional 120 manh hours have been
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
donated to the board by other
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
departments and that other departments
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
could include uh the Departments that
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
come in to to provide some uh an
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and the department of
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
administrative Services as they and doit
 
03:11:28.910 --> 03:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
is we talk about data warehousing so so
 
03:11:31.150 --> 03:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
there are additional indirect costs that
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
are not associated with the hard
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
dollars thank you other representative
 
03:11:40.469 --> 03:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
Woods uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:11:42.990 --> 03:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question did medicine
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
we think in medicine sorry in medicine
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
we like to I think we proceed on and
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
call it evidence-based medicine I think
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
this looks pretty good in the sense of
 
03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based buying yeah um with that
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
said um I'm I a little bit confused that
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm just not reading this
 
03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
carefully enough uh but there's some
 
03:12:08.429 --> 03:12:08.439 align:start position:0%
authority to get the data that you want
 
03:12:10.110 --> 03:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that money is being spent
 
03:12:14.910 --> 03:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
properly and and the muscle behind it um
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
and we've seen this in other committees
 
03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
about money state money being hidden
 
03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:23.070 align:start position:0%
about money state money being hidden
behind

03:12:23.070 --> 03:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
behind
 
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
proprietary uh
 
03:12:28.110 --> 03:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
discretion and not being
 
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
accessible what would prevent like say a
 
03:12:35.790 --> 03:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
PBM um is uh would be one that you would
 
03:12:38.469 --> 03:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
interact with I would presume uh they
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to give up their data uh
 
03:12:43.790 --> 03:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
what Authority do you
 
03:12:47.229 --> 03:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
have the the the the initial legislation
 
03:12:49.630 --> 03:12:49.640 align:start position:0%
from four or five years ago had very
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
strict uh Authority and and we scaled
 
03:12:55.389 --> 03:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
that out until we could build the PAB
 
03:12:57.550 --> 03:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
and figure out what we really need so we
 
03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
could uh make the authority uh
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the the requirement
 
03:13:06.309 --> 03:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
for the data instead of just sort of a
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
plenary uh Authority and and we've
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
scaled it back um representative Woods
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for the particular paragraph
 
03:13:17.710 --> 03:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
but it I think it's uh
 
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
about $500 or so for um a data call that
 
03:13:27.870 --> 03:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
is refused so if we if we've Justified
 
03:13:31.229 --> 03:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
the need for data by having a report
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
format that would serve the needs of a
 
03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
buying entity if we do the U the the the
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
data analysis on it to find out that the
 
03:13:43.229 --> 03:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
data just doesn't exist anywhere in our
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
government system already and that it's
 
03:13:47.870 --> 03:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
a new request for data
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
um and then we form the data request and
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
send it
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
out the entity receiving the data call
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to uh protest say I'm
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
not giving you that it's too business
 
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
sensitive you don't really need it you
 
03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
could get it from other ways there's a a
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
due process Loop that's in this bill
 
03:14:12.110 --> 03:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
that hasn't existed yet uh and at the
 
03:14:14.750 --> 03:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion of that if the pdab
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
determines that we still need the data
 
03:14:20.710 --> 03:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
um then we can issue the data call and
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's a legal obligation of the per of
 
03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
the entity receiving the data call to
 
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
respond and if they don't then they
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
begin to be fined so it's it's very
 
03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
narrow whereas the initial setup it was
 
03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
narrow whereas the initial setup it was
very

03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
broad well I thank you I just I want to
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
clarify that in fact there is an Avenue
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
to get that data and there's no no way
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
for an entity to just plain Stonewall
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
say no that's proprietary information
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
03:14:54.510 --> 03:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
much they they have an opportunity as
 
03:14:56.910 --> 03:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
they should to protest if we've asked
 
03:14:59.790 --> 03:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
for too much data and we give them a due
 
03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
for too much data and we give them a due
process

03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:15:03.550 --> 03:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity and but but still at the end
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the day the PAB is in a judgment
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
position to determine whether or not
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
their protest was adequate or
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
not other questions representative kof
 
03:15:14.960 --> 03:15:17.190 align:start position:0%
not other questions representative kof
fall

03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
fall
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:15:22.510 --> 03:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so the um so so
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
reading through the the annual report
 
03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot in there about
 
03:15:28.469 --> 03:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
rebates and one of the one of the powers
 
03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
in statute is to collect information
 
03:15:32.670 --> 03:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
about rebates so I have really two
 
03:15:35.830 --> 03:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions about that number one is
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
um does the purview of the prescription
 
03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
drug availability board extend to
 
03:15:45.550 --> 03:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines and does the information
 
03:15:47.590 --> 03:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
collected about rebates
 
03:15:50.349 --> 03:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
um apply um
 
03:15:53.150 --> 03:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
to uh rebates or incentive payments that
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
are made to providers for certain
 
03:15:59.469 --> 03:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
meeting certain thresholds for far
 
03:16:02.269 --> 03:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
either Pharmaceuticals Andor
 
03:16:04.630 --> 03:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines okay I'm I'm going to try to
 
03:16:07.229 --> 03:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
answer your question it may not be uh
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
directly correlated but in in in general
 
03:16:13.870 --> 03:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Insurance already
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
collects a tremendous amount of data
 
03:16:19.630 --> 03:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
they get data on actual orders and
 
03:16:22.349 --> 03:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
utilization uh I think some of that
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
information comes through the uh the um
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
um prescription drug boards no what
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
what's the term I'm looking for pvms
 
03:16:35.950 --> 03:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
comes through the pbms but the rebate
 
03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
information so far has been extremely
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to get and to apply to the
 
03:16:46.910 --> 03:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
drug data and therefore uh entities all
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
all over the place trying to figure this
 
03:16:52.349 --> 03:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
stuff out it Das the federal government
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
other states everyone I think is
 
03:16:57.229 --> 03:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
struggling with the idea that these
 
03:16:59.910 --> 03:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
rebate mechanisms are so obscure and
 
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
Byzantine that it's very difficult to
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
take that that that information if you
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
even if you can get it and then apply it
 
03:17:10.429 --> 03:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
to the actual drugs so you can know what
 
03:17:13.590 --> 03:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
the true cost of the drugs are so that
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's a problem and and I think that's
 
03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
one that the pdab is working with with
 
03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
the doit for the coming annual
 
03:17:24.269 --> 03:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
report and and like I said The Honorable
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant is here he's the chair
 
03:17:27.910 --> 03:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
he's been working this problem for four
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
years he he could
 
03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
elaborate follow um so if that is the
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
case because rebates play a significant
 
03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
role in pricing or in obscuring
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
transparency in pricing um and if PB if
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
the uh PD um prescription drug
 
03:17:49.550 --> 03:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
availability board doesn't have access
 
03:17:50.429 --> 03:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
information um it is it obscuring the
 
03:17:56.110 --> 03:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
ability of the board to to do its work
 
03:17:59.349 --> 03:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
and you know can the can the board be
 
03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
effective under those
 
03:18:02.990 --> 03:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances I won't get to the
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
effectiveness uh question uh I think
 
03:18:08.590 --> 03:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
right away but I I'll I'll I'll say that
 
03:18:11.630 --> 03:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
the entire predicate of the board is the
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
belief that if we have price
 
03:18:16.750 --> 03:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
transparency we can provide recom
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the purchasers of of
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
our drugs where they can use that in
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
their contract
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations and so to the extent that
 
03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
we have really well-qualified drug
 
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
transparency you would assume that that
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
would lead to better negotiating
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
positions which is maybe why it's so
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
hard to get the data I I don't know
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's where this kind of gets gray and
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
then the question on whether or not the
 
03:18:48.349 --> 03:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
pdab is effective without being able to
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
do that I I I I think the ultimate
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
um indicator of Effectiveness is the
 
03:18:59.469 --> 03:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
extent to which the uh pdab is able to
 
03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
provide value added recommendations to
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
our purchasers that they can Implement
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
and start saving real money so so far
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any recommendations
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
money other
 
03:19:20.990 --> 03:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done all right thank
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:34.510 --> 03:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is former
 
03:19:36.510 --> 03:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
state representative Gary Merchant and
 
03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
former member of this committee welcome
 
03:19:39.279 --> 03:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
former member of this committee welcome
representative

03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant representative Merchant I have
 
03:19:45.790 --> 03:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
to admonish you we try to stick to three
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
minutes here you ask for
 
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
five I'll try to wrap it up as quick as
 
03:19:52.349 --> 03:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
I can Mr chair thank you um it's a
 
03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be back before this
 
03:19:55.150 --> 03:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
committee it was a pleasure to serve
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this committee for a few years uh I
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
learned a lot and uh hope you guys will
 
03:20:03.309 --> 03:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
bear with me as well so what I would say
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to do on the
 
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
prescription affordability board is
 
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
bringer greater transparency into the
 
03:20:09.790 --> 03:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to make people
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
more aware of what the market Works um
 
03:20:14.309 --> 03:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a strong believer in a free market
 
03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
but I also believe a free market only
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
works when transparency is available and
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
data is Flowing freely um if the buyer
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
is not aware of the market and what's
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
going on it really in a lot of ways puts
 
03:20:26.910 --> 03:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
them out a
 
03:20:28.870 --> 03:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
disincentive so when you look at the
 
03:20:30.429 --> 03:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire to give you some
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
idea about the magnitude of what we
 
03:20:35.150 --> 03:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
spend in
 
03:20:40.630 --> 03:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
2022 we spent $1.7 billion that's with a
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
B the state of New Hampshire by itself
 
03:20:46.750 --> 03:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
spends multiple millions of dollars on
 
03:20:48.429 --> 03:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
um prescription
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
drugs if we don't find a way to begin to
 
03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
bend the cost curve and try to
 
03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on in the
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
marketplace we cannot as a state nor as
 
03:21:03.870 --> 03:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
a citizen try to bend that cost gr so
 
03:21:05.070 --> 03:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
what this is I worked with
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards also with Senator
 
03:21:10.189 --> 03:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
rosenell is trying to find a way to
 
03:21:12.630 --> 03:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
collect the data that the Board needs in
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
order to begin to bring greater
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
transparency to the marketplace and try
 
03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
to educate ourselves as well as other
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
folks that rely upon the
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
market so that's the whole intent here
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
is to say we don't need to be in the
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
collecting of the data process the board
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
should not have to build its own
 
03:21:33.269 --> 03:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to collect the data there
 
03:21:34.830 --> 03:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
are other entities in the state that
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
collect data the Department of Health
 
03:21:40.510 --> 03:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services the department of iot the
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
um insurance department we don't need to
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
recreate that infrastructure what we
 
03:21:46.750 --> 03:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
need to do is have the ability to
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
identify what data we need for the
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
reports let that entity collect the data
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
on our behalf and then have that entity
 
03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
once they collect the data share with
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the board that's an efficient way for a
 
03:21:59.710 --> 03:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
government to work I was up to upstairs
 
03:22:02.670 --> 03:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
with Edna talking about a data warehouse
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
we have various silos in our state that
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
collect data but they don't talk to each
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
other so it's a separate bill but this
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
is back to the same thing is we're
 
03:22:12.910 --> 03:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to use State
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
resources efficiently and economically
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
to ultim allowed the board to accomplish
 
03:22:22.349 --> 03:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
its mission that was stated in the
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
statute thank you any
 
03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing oh oh there he is
 
03:22:30.239 --> 03:22:31.710 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing oh oh there he is
representative

03:22:31.710 --> 03:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:22:36.990 --> 03:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my question just
 
03:22:39.750 --> 03:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
just for I'm still trying to piece this
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
together um could you give me just an
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
example of who would be the consumers of
 
03:22:52.590 --> 03:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
the reports that would be generated and
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
what kind of information would you be
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
talking about going into the reports I'm
 
03:22:58.389 --> 03:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand H how does
 
03:23:00.269 --> 03:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
this work who's using the report what
 
03:23:01.710 --> 03:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
data are they
 
03:23:04.189 --> 03:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
using that's a really good
 
03:23:07.229 --> 03:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
question represent McLean I think the
 
03:23:09.429 --> 03:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
intent of the report is to provide
 
03:23:12.030 --> 03:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
information to the buyers in our state
 
03:23:14.349 --> 03:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
and when I say about the buyers it's the
 
03:23:16.510 --> 03:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
people who buy the prescription drug B
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
benefit is helping them understand
 
03:23:20.590 --> 03:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
what's a reasonable contract what's a
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable price so when they're
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
negotiating they have some Benchmark to
 
03:23:27.790 --> 03:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
M Mark against today they don't have
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
anything there's no recommendation
 
03:23:30.670 --> 03:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
saying this is a fair price this is not
 
03:23:33.150 --> 03:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
a fair price it doesn't I want to be
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
clear about this it does not in any way
 
03:23:38.910 --> 03:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
disallow someone from charging whatever
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
they want what we're talking about for
 
03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations which is back to the
 
03:23:43.910 --> 03:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
same thing the free market is saying
 
03:23:46.750 --> 03:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
this is a reasonable price this is not
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
if you go out if you think about the
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
Kelly Blue Book it tells you what a
 
03:23:52.150 --> 03:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable price is to buy a car does it
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't mean that the dealer can
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they want they can
 
03:23:58.830 --> 03:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
charge $100,000 for the car but the
 
03:24:01.030 --> 03:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
Kelly Blue Book says it's only worth
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
30,000 it's still your choice to pay the
 
03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
100,000 but at least you have something
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
to go back to to look at the market and
 
03:24:10.510 --> 03:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
saying what's reasonable we don't have
 
03:24:13.630 --> 03:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
anything like that this Market is so
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
opeg it's like walking into the dealer
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
and saying
 
03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
hm I like that car what do you think
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's worth are you relying upon them
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
telling you what it's worth versus going
 
03:24:25.870 --> 03:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
to a third party like the Kelly book and
 
03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
saying based upon the Kelly book I think
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
this is reasonable what you chargeing me
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
and what you want to charge me is
 
03:24:34.830 --> 03:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonable but there's no reference if
 
03:24:38.189 --> 03:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
you will repres clean there's no third
 
03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
party database to
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
help follow up so in going after this
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
information you mentioned the we have a
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS um are are they going to be the
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
primary information reserves that you're
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to or you're going to be going to
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers themselves and the the
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
the compliance mechanisms that you have
 
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
in here is it just for the Departments
 
03:25:06.510 --> 03:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
or is it for
 
03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
everybody can you if you would when you
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
say compliance compliance with the
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
datally say so yeah so I I I have a data
 
03:25:18.590 --> 03:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
call and you uh don't give me the data
 
03:25:21.870 --> 03:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
so after 14 days you know I said this is
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
fair this is a reasonable request you're
 
03:25:26.229 --> 03:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
not meeting this request so you you owe
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
me 500 bucks or whatever it is 500 bucks
 
03:25:32.269 --> 03:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
a day up until I hit 25,000 and then it
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
caps off is that being paid by the the
 
03:25:40.269 --> 03:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
non-complying department or the
 
03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer can you go to the
 
03:25:43.630 --> 03:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers themselves who are you
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
seeing as the people that are going to
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
be paying that fine
 
03:25:50.189 --> 03:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
The Entity that's required to submit the
 
03:25:52.269 --> 03:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
data is the one that's going to be on
 
03:25:54.670 --> 03:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
the hook for the $500 not the department
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
that receives it so be clear if you're
 
03:25:58.189 --> 03:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
asking from the manufacturer they're the
 
03:26:00.429 --> 03:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
ones on the hook to comply if it's
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
coming from the PBM it's coming from the
 
03:26:04.630 --> 03:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
pvm whatever the entity is that's being
 
03:26:06.830 --> 03:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
asked for the data they're the ones that
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
are on hook to pay you the fine if they
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
data so I noticed that the fine caps out
 
03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:20.269 align:start position:0%
data so I noticed that the fine caps out
at

03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
$25,000 so um given we we're talking
 
03:26:27.550 --> 03:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
about hundreds of millions and billions
 
03:26:30.750 --> 03:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
of dollars and information is very
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
valuable um how is that amount arrived
 
03:26:36.229 --> 03:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
at and do you think that that's an
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
effective stick or
 
03:26:41.550 --> 03:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
not it could just Stonewall
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
you they could call it a cost of doing
 
03:26:46.269 --> 03:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
business I don't disagree with you um I
 
03:26:48.990 --> 03:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's a place to start if we find
 
03:26:50.910 --> 03:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
that with people stonewalling us at that
 
03:26:53.710 --> 03:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
point in time and $25,000 on a
 
03:26:56.429 --> 03:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
7.1.7 billion worth a book of business
 
03:26:58.590 --> 03:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
is just the cost of doing business then
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think we need to come back to the
 
03:27:01.790 --> 03:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
legislative body and saying it's not
 
03:27:03.990 --> 03:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
working they're stonewalling we need to
 
03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a way to break through it whether
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's with fiscal penalties or some other
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
way to get there I don't know but I
 
03:27:12.429 --> 03:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
thought it was reasonable at $25,000 the
 
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
capit to begin the process and not get
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
into something so honorous that it would
 
03:27:19.269 --> 03:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
be so difficult to even get it to the
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislative body thank you other um
 
03:27:26.750 --> 03:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative woods and then and did I
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
see someone else yeah okay then yes I
 
03:27:31.950 --> 03:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
know go ahead representative Woods um
 
03:27:34.110 --> 03:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
03:27:37.150 --> 03:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
good to see you um I'm I'm I'm concerned
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
about this nebulous reasonable price
 
03:27:49.870 --> 03:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable uh in the eyes of uh
 
03:27:52.670 --> 03:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
myself as an enduser will be vastly
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
different than the reasonable price if
 
03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a PBM uh and it's vastly different
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
that if I'm a pharmaceutical
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturer putting out a drug that's
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh May save millions of dollars uh and
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh thousands of lives um how do you
 
03:28:14.429 --> 03:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
arrive at uh at the ground level of this
 
03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
is a and what factors do you include
 
03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
when you say it's a reasonable
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
price well that's a very good question
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Whits it's one I wrestle
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
with but there are third-party entities
 
03:28:30.189 --> 03:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
that spent a lot of time and a lot of
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
resources trying to come up with
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
something that's reasonable um you have
 
03:28:37.070 --> 03:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
iser which is available um it's out
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
there in the marketplace when new drugs
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
come to the market they do actually
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
develop what they think is a reasonable
 
03:28:44.189 --> 03:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
price for based upon the market based
 
03:28:47.070 --> 03:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
upon the resources used to create it it
 
03:28:48.910 --> 03:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
does not preclude somebody for paying
 
03:28:51.150 --> 03:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
more than that because the board is
 
03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
basically making a
 
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation so you have the issue of
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
what's reasonable and how you define it
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
I think it's also a critical question
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the advisory Council which is
 
03:29:03.070 --> 03:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
comprised of many stakeholders and
 
03:29:04.990 --> 03:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
asking for their input as well so it's
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
not like the board's making this
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
decision in a vacuum it's really looking
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
for broad stakeholder opinion before
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
they try to come up with some
 
03:29:18.189 --> 03:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation followup thank you um in
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
that consideration I guess I'm trying to
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
say if you consider the social value of
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
drugs as well uh we think about the
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
immediate value of you know solving
 
03:29:31.910 --> 03:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
someone's problem either uh getting rid
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
of Representative uh um are just as U
 
03:29:40.830 --> 03:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
cold uh versus um someone curing cancer
 
03:29:42.510 --> 03:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh and those have
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
value um and some have other social
 
03:29:47.790 --> 03:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
values as as well is is that taken into
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
account uh uh in discussion with one of
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
the U this is a true story um uh one of
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
the drug reps uh uh that has the hepc
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
and as you know dosage of hepc is
 
03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
horrific and my query was uh why well uh
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're saving Society millions of dollars
 
03:30:18.030 --> 03:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
return that I totally agree with I think
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
when it comes to trying to understand
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
what the fairness of a price comes into
 
03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
multiple factors including offsetting
 
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
medical cost I can remember
 
03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
when um H2 or peptid if you will get the
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
market and it was supposed to be very
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
expensive but it was saving surgery uh
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
there was ways to prevented so you have
 
03:30:42.150 --> 03:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
to look at to your point the whole cost
 
03:30:44.189 --> 03:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
Spectrum so it's not like you're looking
 
03:30:45.670 --> 03:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
at strictly one piece of it but you got
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
to look at the whole overall impact of
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
healthcare so we're not trying to
 
03:30:51.790 --> 03:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
isolate the drug cost by itself but
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
looking at the overall
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
impact representative McGrath and then
 
03:30:55.920 --> 03:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
impact representative McGrath and then
representative

03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:31:00.510 --> 03:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
kofel thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:31:04.950 --> 03:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you explain
 
03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
how being a
 
03:31:09.850 --> 03:31:09.860 align:start position:0%
pharmacist a um
 
03:31:09.860 --> 03:31:11.150 align:start position:0%
pharmacist a um
[Music]

03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
prescription um PBM negotiates with the
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
Insurance on behalf of tens of thousands
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
of patients for the best price and yet
 
03:31:25.710 --> 03:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
that price is hundreds of dollars more
 
03:31:29.349 --> 03:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
of every generic discount card that's
 
03:31:32.349 --> 03:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
negotiated with a
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacy no I cannot and that's part of
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm trying to with the
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
prescription Dr affordability board be
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
good to understand it I just came across
 
03:31:42.510 --> 03:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
something the other day not to D just
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
divert myself but a lot of the
 
03:31:48.189 --> 03:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
prescription discount cards we have do
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
data yeah we in our
 
03:31:57.630 --> 03:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution have data protection
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
seriously that we put in the
 
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution here we are taking these
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities and letting people sell
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
our data there are which came to our
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
attention at the board ways to use a
 
03:32:10.670 --> 03:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
card like that from other states that
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
created something that prohibits them
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
from sharing that data that's an example
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
but back to your question which you
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
asked there's no way right now I mean if
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
you look at Mark Cuban this Market is so
 
03:32:25.710 --> 03:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
opaque it's like The Wizard of Oz behind
 
03:32:28.269 --> 03:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
the black curtain trying to figure out
 
03:32:30.030 --> 03:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on until you pull it back
 
03:32:31.830 --> 03:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
you don't really understand
 
03:32:35.309 --> 03:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
it representative kofo thank you Mr
 
03:32:37.870 --> 03:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of questions actually
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
but the first one is a followup to to uh
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative Wood's question regarding
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable what's reasonable so would uh
 
03:32:48.120 --> 03:32:49.469 align:start position:0%
reasonable what's reasonable so would uh
potentially

03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:32:53.710 --> 03:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
substitutable um Pharmaceuticals be an
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
example like would that be a basis for
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
determining what is reasonable if
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's a generic or other substitute
 
03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
that could be um offered in replacement
 
03:33:06.550 --> 03:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative Cal I think we're talking
 
03:33:08.309 --> 03:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
about another bill that's being brought
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
forth and that's in the biologics and
 
03:33:13.150 --> 03:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
when you look at the biologic market
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
right now it's unreasonable because you
 
03:33:17.550 --> 03:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
have a situation where the pharmacist
 
03:33:20.830 --> 03:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
cannot allow an interchange with a
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
patient to save them money so the
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
reasonableness it comes back to is what
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
is reasonable based upon what's
 
03:33:29.070 --> 03:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
available so if you have competing
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
entities on the product or on something
 
03:33:34.309 --> 03:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
comparable to it and you can save money
 
03:33:36.269 --> 03:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
for the patient should we not allow the
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
marketplace to do exactly what it's
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and allow people in the
 
03:33:43.229 --> 03:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
in the play if you will to be able to
 
03:33:45.150 --> 03:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that on behalf of the
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
patient or
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
payer so reasonableness is really not
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
defined in one particular way it's
 
03:33:52.830 --> 03:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
defined upon many different ways to
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
Define it so I'm with you
 
03:33:58.870 --> 03:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
100% follow up can can you offer
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
specific examples of pricing that
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
category um the last time I was last
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
year talking about drug you have a
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
herera and you have Huma $80,000 a year
 
03:34:13.389 --> 03:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
less price and you have something else
 
03:34:16.189 --> 03:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
at strug B which is probably 4 0,000
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like a great savings and you have
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
another one drug C which is
 
03:34:24.110 --> 03:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
20,000 but if you don't have a situation
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
for the pharmacist to allow them the
 
03:34:27.630 --> 03:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
market if you will to work with the
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
patient saying you should have a choice
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
between Hamera B or C 80 40 or
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
20 that's a question bringing that Tye
 
03:34:38.710 --> 03:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
of transparency that kind of information
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
to the buyer to allow them to understand
 
03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's available to them and right now
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
that is not really readily available
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's like goes back to my blue my blue
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
Kelly book it's having something that
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
somebody can look at and saying this is
 
03:34:55.870 --> 03:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
where the market prices are these are
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
comparable products and this is
 
03:34:59.469 --> 03:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
something you can work with if you're
 
03:35:01.150 --> 03:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
thinking you'd go back to your physician
 
03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
go back to your physician but you need
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
to educate the buyer about what's there
 
03:35:06.910 --> 03:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
including Physicians for the most part
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're trained nothing against Dr Woods
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
here or Dr pler but or Dr um
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
telsey they're focus on your care and
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get you the best thing for
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
your care they possibly can but there
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
should be a way for all the parties to
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
have access to data about what the
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs cost and help them
 
03:35:31.189 --> 03:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
understand what the choices are
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:38.189 --> 03:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
questions one final one final one sorry
 
03:35:40.269 --> 03:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
so would this would this
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill provide the board with the
 
03:35:46.189 --> 03:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
information that it needs to to increase
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
the transparency around rebates
 
03:35:51.150 --> 03:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
specifically I can say that it will
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
provide the board with more information
 
03:35:54.510 --> 03:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
that it needs to begin the process of
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
transparency I cannot guarantee that
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
having the data is going to do that but
 
03:36:00.910 --> 03:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
I can say what we're doing today without
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
working anyone
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Dr Jason
 
03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.189 --> 03:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
pdab and could you identify the person
 
03:36:28.199 --> 03:36:28.910 align:start position:0%
pdab and could you identify the person
with

03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:36:31.630 --> 03:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon thank you for your
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
time to Har us I have with me here
 
03:36:35.070 --> 03:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
Morgan Harris she's our director of
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare analytics at the insurance
 
03:36:39.229 --> 03:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
department my name is Jason AIS director
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
of Health economics at New Hampshire
 
03:36:42.990 --> 03:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurance department um Miss Harris
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
works with the prescription drug rebate
 
03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
data submitted to the department by
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
pbms we wrote um a redundancy
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
elimination report at the direction of
 
03:36:55.630 --> 03:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature publ
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
published it late last summer um to my
 
03:37:02.990 --> 03:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
recollection is posted to the pabs
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
website the New Hampshire pabs website
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
and um I we did see some uh reference to
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
redundancies streamlining the
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for data share data
 
03:37:16.349 --> 03:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
collection sharing and Reporting
 
03:37:19.269 --> 03:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
um so the department has a neutral
 
03:37:21.070 --> 03:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but we're here to
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that might arise
 
03:37:27.630 --> 03:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions W okay I guess I I'll question
 
03:37:34.269 --> 03:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
out at the moment okay thank you for
 
03:37:40.229 --> 03:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.229 --> 03:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Linda

New Hampshire to express our strong
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
support for House Bill
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
645 in my prior 30 years working for the
 
03:38:29.630 --> 03:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
state I was Medicaid Finance director at
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
one point and in my last position I was
 
03:38:35.070 --> 03:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of administrative Services
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
we were in charge of administering the
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
active and retirees health program for
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
over 40,000
 
03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
lives in both jobs escalating drug costs
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
were a challenge to understand and to
 
03:38:49.870 --> 03:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
try and manage data made all the
 
03:38:52.469 --> 03:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
difference and data saved the state
 
03:38:55.030 --> 03:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
money I am concerned about the rising
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
cost of prescription drugs and its
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
impact on older adults in our community
 
03:39:01.950 --> 03:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
an article I read over the weekend
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
stated the two largest age groups in New
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are 55 to 59 and 60 to
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
64 in the same article the New
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's office of Planning and
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
Development projections for the
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
population in the 65 plus Community is
 
03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
an expected growth of
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
66% from 2020 to
 
03:39:25.950 --> 03:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
2040 as many of you know the 55 plus
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
Community is the group that AARP
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
represents I fully support the New
 
03:39:33.070 --> 03:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescription drug
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
affordability board and its goal to make
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs more affordable for
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
Granite State families it's a valuable
 
03:39:42.110 --> 03:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
resource for New Hampshire and we need
 
03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
to support it I support house bill 645
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
because the pdap needs access to data to
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
do their job fortunately much of the
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
data they need is already being
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
collected by other state agencies House
 
03:39:58.590 --> 03:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 645 will create an efficient way
 
03:40:01.389 --> 03:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
for the pdap to access this data helping
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
them to fulfill their mission on behalf
 
03:40:06.269 --> 03:40:06.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire citizens with access to
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
the data the pdap can better address
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
High prescription drug cost benefiting
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
consumers facing expensive drug prices
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I urge the committee to
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 645 to ensure the
 
03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
pdap can work effectively for New
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents the pdap is a great
 
03:40:27.150 --> 03:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
resource and we need to use it to
 
03:40:29.429 --> 03:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
support its mission to improve access
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
and affordability of prescription drugs
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
for all of the grand estate families
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%

03:40:41.229 --> 03:40:41.239 align:start position:0%

03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if the committee's already
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
been provided copies of amendment
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%

03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
out um Miss Grant uh I thought um Karen
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%

03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%

03:42:02.830 --> 03:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
yet we have oh there it comes it com
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%

you thank you Mr chair and members of
 
03:42:12.510 --> 03:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
the committee good afternoon U I'm
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative Mary hacken Phillips of
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
graft and 12 serving Handover and lime
 
03:42:18.269 --> 03:42:18.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm very pleased to be with you
 
03:42:21.309 --> 03:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
today to introduce HB 724 relative to
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
lead paint poisoning prevention and
 
03:42:25.870 --> 03:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
Remediation at this time I'd like to
 
03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.149 --> 03:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
2025-the only difference from the bill
 
03:42:49.189 --> 03:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
and the amendment offered is that
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
section two of the original bill which
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
lowers the threshold for blood liad
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
level investigations has been removed
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
given it has a significant fiscal impact
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
the original intent for the bill was to
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
offer a no cost high impact solution to
 
03:43:07.070 --> 03:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
prevent or remediate lead poisonings and
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
so I'll be focusing my testimony today
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
on that Amendment um during today's
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
hearing but of course there will be
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
folks here um and I'm happy to speak
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
about that section at a later time if if
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
the committee so
 
03:43:22.910 --> 03:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
chooses so to begin with uh the
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
prevailing belief is that lead poisoning
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
in kids is a problem that New Hampshire
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
solved decades ago when Congress banned
 
03:43:32.469 --> 03:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
lead paint essentially in
 
03:43:36.269 --> 03:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
1978 we understand the cause and we know
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
what the solution is uh scientific
 
03:43:42.269 --> 03:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
experts inform us that lad exposure
 
03:43:46.750 --> 03:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
through paint dust consumer products and
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
water causes elevated blood levels in
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
children who are more susceptible to
 
03:43:52.510 --> 03:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning than
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
adults children with elevated blood
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
levels and turn experience reduced
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
learning capability ability to pay
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
attention an academic achievement but
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
high levels of blood Le poisoning can
 
03:44:06.910 --> 03:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
cause irreversible Health damage and
 
03:44:10.110 --> 03:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
this is a permanent trauma to the child
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
and their family the solution once a
 
03:44:16.149 --> 03:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
child is poisoned is very expensive
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
medical interventions and treatments for
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
the child remediation of lead in the
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
property or a complete disposal of the
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
product an ongoing financial support for
 
03:44:28.149 --> 03:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
Education emotional and behavioral
 
03:44:30.189 --> 03:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
development at school and in our
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
communities so you see the effects
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
Ripple wide and they're just
 
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
devastating so the sponsors argue that
 
03:44:41.710 --> 03:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
we have a duty and a moral imperative to
 
03:44:43.830 --> 03:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
act so that we're not waiting for New
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's babies to be poison before
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
we do something about it thankfully
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
Congress has passed many laws in the
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
past aimed at preventing lead poisoning
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
for instance Congress in 1992 passed an
 
03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
act that requires lead paint disclosures
 
03:44:59.790 --> 03:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
for most real estate built before
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
1978 which has really increased the
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
Public's awareness of what lead paint is
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
doing in aging housing and in particular
 
03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 I'm sorry 2008 the EPA
 
03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
established the renovation repair and
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
painting regulatory program which
 
03:45:17.950 --> 03:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
requires contractors and landlords to be
 
03:45:20.149 --> 03:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
trained and certified and led safe
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
practices to lawfully work on projects
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
that dist um disturb lead based paints
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
and homes child care facilities and
 
03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
schools built before
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
1978 here in New Hampshire the
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
legislature has most recently passed RSA
 
03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
130-a colon 5-d which requires Property
 
03:45:40.429 --> 03:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
Owners to have a lead safe certificate
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
prior to occupancy and newly constructed
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
rental properties and newly licensed
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
Child Care Facilities located in
 
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
buildings that were constructed before
 
03:45:52.030 --> 03:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
1978 so these laws together and others
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
make up part of the solution to reducing
 
03:45:54.120 --> 03:45:55.070 align:start position:0%
make up part of the solution to reducing
lead

03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
lead
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning but the New Hampshire
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
December report based on its own testing
 
03:46:04.110 --> 03:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
data indicates that these Solutions are
 
03:46:07.149 --> 03:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
not enough members have received copies
 
03:46:09.510 --> 03:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
of this recent DHHS report in their
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
legislative mailboxes and I really
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to check this
 
03:46:16.510 --> 03:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
out uh perhaps you've learned or heard
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
about this um in the news reports that
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
have been across our state in the past
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
week um DH hs's report says the number
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
of children here in New Hampshire
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
identified with elevated blood levels
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
has increased since 2021 and it's at its
 
03:46:37.070 --> 03:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
highest level since child blood Le level
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
testing was enacted in
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
2018 that's right and a miss an
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
estimated 1,142 children here in New
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have elevated blood L levels
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
high enough to impair their ability to
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
think learn and concentrate in
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
2023 so concentrations of child's lead
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
poisoning is most pressing in Manchester
 
03:47:01.870 --> 03:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
and nashwa but no community no region
 
03:47:04.469 --> 03:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
and no County in our state has been
 
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
unscathed moreover poisoning numbers are
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
probably worse than reported given that
 
03:47:12.429 --> 03:47:12.439 align:start position:0%
every child in New Hampshire is tested
 
03:47:15.189 --> 03:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
so here's the takeaway the lead poison
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire has gotten
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
worse and we have to do something about
 
03:47:20.349 --> 03:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
it to keep our kids
 
03:47:22.590 --> 03:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
safe so this legislature can
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
affirmatively act by advancing HB 724 as
 
03:47:28.149 --> 03:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
amended and to take another step towards
 
03:47:29.790 --> 03:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
the prevention and Remediation of lead
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
poisoning today the amended bill has
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
three no cost solutions for your
 
03:47:37.469 --> 03:47:37.479 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'll just briefly
 
03:47:39.389 --> 03:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
explain those now so if you're looking
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
at Amendment
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
0222 it changes our RSA 130 a the lead
 
03:47:47.790 --> 03:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
paint poisoning and prevention control
 
03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
and control chapter law with the
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
following additional paragraphs so
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
section one of your amendment requires
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
that building permit applications
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
include the EPA RRP license number for
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
any person engaged in renovation repair
 
03:48:04.830 --> 03:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
or painting of buildings erected prior
 
03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
to January 1st
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
1978 under the existing epa's renovation
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
repair and painting rule homeowners are
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
already required to use a licensed
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
service provider for these projects so
 
03:48:20.590 --> 03:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
the change to an application form helps
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
remind contractors and homeowners of
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
their legal
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility the New
 
03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal association's town
 
03:48:30.750 --> 03:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
and cities magazine noted that
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities have a role to play in
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
preventing childhood lead exposure and
 
03:48:37.830 --> 03:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
many municipalities here in New
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are already doing this um it's
 
03:48:43.710 --> 03:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
a simple no cost um change to an
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
application and um you may know that
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
towns such as Sugar Hill are already
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
doing this their permit application has
 
03:48:52.630 --> 03:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
been printed and it'll be here for you
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
to take a look at what this looks like
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
in Practical um implementation a little
 
03:48:56.880 --> 03:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
in Practical um implementation a little
later

03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
today section two of this amendment
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
Bill restores the Department of Health
 
03:49:06.189 --> 03:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
and Human Services Authority to inspect
 
03:49:10.030 --> 03:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
subsidiary units if another unit in the
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
same multi-unit building is found to
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
have a lead paint Hazard and in the past
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS had had this Authority but at some
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
point it was removed from Statute in
 
03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:23.229 align:start position:0%
point it was removed from Statute in
approximately

03:49:23.229 --> 03:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
2018 um in consultation with the
 
03:49:28.750 --> 03:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
Department stakeholders and sponsors of
 
03:49:29.710 --> 03:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
this bill have learned that the
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
department would welcome the restoration
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
of that authority to protect all the
 
03:49:35.710 --> 03:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
people in the same building that is
 
03:49:38.349 --> 03:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
known to have a potential lead Hazard so
 
03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
the department here today can verify or
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
the department is here today and can
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
verify um that it believes this
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
subsidiary unit inspection work can be
 
03:49:50.189 --> 03:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
absorbed without a fiscal impact to the
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
state finally section three of the
 
03:49:54.630 --> 03:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
amended Bill establishes a rebuttable
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
presumption of lead in pre-1978 housing
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
unless lead inspector has determined the
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
dwelling or unit does not contain lead
 
03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:04.750 align:start position:0%
dwelling or unit does not contain lead
based

03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
based
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
substances this change will create a law
 
03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
sorry a low barrier evidentiary tool in
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
court that any pre-1978 housing is
 
03:50:16.990 --> 03:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
likely to contain Lea based hazards so
 
03:50:19.229 --> 03:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
this is another no cost strategy for
 
03:50:21.630 --> 03:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
preventing lead blood Le level
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
poisonings that have been effective in
 
03:50:26.110 --> 03:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
other states in our region including
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
Vermont so I'm just calling on my
 
03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues on both sides of the
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
political aisle as well as in both
 
03:50:33.790 --> 03:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
Chambers to join the sponsors in
 
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
preventing childhood Le poisonings by
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
supporting HB 724 as
 
03:50:41.550 --> 03:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
amended we hope you will agree it's a no
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
cost multifaceted approach proven to
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
reduce Le exposure in New Hampshire
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
worthy of your support this will be
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
another step in reducing the lead risk
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
to children in our state and please know
 
03:50:54.670 --> 03:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsors will continue to push for
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
no cost low cost and ideas with return
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
on investments to reduce the lead risk
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
to Children Here in New
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I know there are many
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates here planning to speak today
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
in more detail and if the chair should
 
03:51:10.750 --> 03:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
agree and the committee does not object
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
object I'm hoping the next speaker could
 
03:51:15.070 --> 03:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
be attorney haidu tarco of the
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
conservation law
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation um who has several handouts
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
that will be helpful for the committee
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
to um INF framing the discussion um
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
today so I'd personally like to thank
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors and the conservation law
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
foundation for their partnership and
 
03:51:34.030 --> 03:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
working on this bill and thank you for
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
your time and if there are any questions
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer them this
 
03:51:40.750 --> 03:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative does the
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee have any
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative m
 
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
graph thank you Miss chair and thank you
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
question so this graph is really
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
interesting uh we've had mandatory
 
03:51:57.510 --> 03:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
testing and it was going down do we know
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
why and now it's going up do we know why
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so the amount of testing went
 
03:52:04.750 --> 03:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
down during the covid pandemic because
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
not as many families were coming in for
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
their children's annual inspections when
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
this blood test requirement usually
 
03:52:11.560 --> 03:52:12.429 align:start position:0%
this blood test requirement usually
takes

03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
takes
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
place um but I'm sure the experts here
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
can speak to the you know nuances as
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you can you please
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
repeat who you said you'd like to speak
 
03:52:34.030 --> 03:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
next yes it's attorney Heidi trarco from
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
the conser conservation law Foundation
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.479 --> 03:53:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
try thank you um nice to see you again
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Heidi trarco I'm an attorney
 
03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
with the conservation law foundation and
 
03:53:11.710 --> 03:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh 3 minutes is quick so I will run
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
through my material I've submitted
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
written material in support of of the
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill um and you're getting a c copy of
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
that now and that has some documents
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
attached to it so that might be helpful
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
when you um are looking it has the DHS
 
03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
2023 data brief it has a uh building
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
permit from the town of Sugar Hill so
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
you can see what this looks like on a
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
building permit and it has one of the
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
economic studies um cited in my
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd also like to note um some
 
03:53:41.710 --> 03:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that the committee should have
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
received electronically from people who
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
were wanted to test to find support of
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
the bill but can't be here today um the
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
first is Dr Christine Arseno from the
 
03:53:51.269 --> 03:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Pediatric Society or the
 
03:53:53.349 --> 03:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire AAP the chapter of the
 
03:53:55.870 --> 03:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Society the Pediatric Society
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
strongly supports the bill and urges the
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee ought to pass and you should
 
03:54:01.510 --> 03:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
have her testimony also testimony from
 
03:54:03.269 --> 03:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
Charlene lit the former mayor of the
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
City of Claremont who also supports the
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
bill and brings a real Municipal
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
perspective um and discusses how
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
Claremont has done similar things that
 
03:54:15.070 --> 03:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
this bill provides to remediate LED
 
03:54:16.830 --> 03:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
problems in Claremont and how that
 
03:54:18.269 --> 03:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
worked in Claremont and urges the
 
03:54:25.510 --> 03:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:27.870 --> 03:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
bill as you've heard and as I hope
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
you've seen in the data brief and in the
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
news the recent DHHS report shows the
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
highest blad poisoning levels in
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
children since we began recording those
 
03:54:39.309 --> 03:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
numbers in
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
2019 and the jump up to
 
03:54:45.750 --> 03:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
1,142 Children which is a 42% increase
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
from the 2022 cannot be attributed to an
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
increase in testing Alone um for example
 
03:54:54.149 --> 03:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
the testing in 2023 the numbers of
 
03:54:56.149 --> 03:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
children tested is very similar to The
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
Numbers tested in 2019 before the
 
03:55:01.149 --> 03:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic so we're testing about the same
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
number of children and having elevated
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.429 --> 03:55:14.439 align:start position:0%
lead and as the sponsor told you not all
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
the kids are being tested so about 70%
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
of our children are being tested so we
 
03:55:20.429 --> 03:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot more children out
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
there who are likely poisoned by lead
 
03:55:25.229 --> 03:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
and we can also understand that a lot of
 
03:55:26.910 --> 03:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
these children who aren't getting tested
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
are probably our most vulnerable
 
03:55:30.670 --> 03:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
children and more likely to be exposed
 
03:55:33.149 --> 03:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
to lead hazards and the data Bears this
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
out it is our poorest children in New
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are the most susceptible
 
03:55:39.469 --> 03:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
to lead poisoning they are twice as
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
likely to be poisoned by lead and for
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children on Medicaid one
 
03:55:46.990 --> 03:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
in 10 is poisoned by lead it's really
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
tragic there are some experts here today
 
03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
who will talk about what happens when a
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
child is poisoned by lead why this is so
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
terrible and the lifelong impacts that
 
03:55:58.590 --> 03:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
child will carry um I have references in
 
03:56:01.389 --> 03:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
my testimony as well to support that and
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
I know the committee has a lot of
 
03:56:04.830 --> 03:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
medical experience and you can all draw
 
03:56:06.990 --> 03:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
on your personal knowledge of what the
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
dangers of lead poisoning um but I'd
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
like to point out to the committee
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
really quickly and you'll see this in my
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that the state has also
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
studied that investing in lead poisoning
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
prevention saves the state a lot of
 
03:56:23.149 --> 03:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
money DHHS in 2014 estimated that
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
medical treatment and special education
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
costs for lead poison kids cost the kids
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
about cost the state roughly $300,000 a
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
year which in today's dollars is about
 
03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars a year um and
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
taking into all the other um expenses
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
that occur in families and communities
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
and the state the cost of lead poisoning
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
is in the millions of of dollars and
 
03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's references to dhs's report I
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it because it's like 25
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
pages but the link is in my testimony so
 
03:56:54.389 --> 03:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
you can go read that data for yourself
 
03:56:56.349 --> 03:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could start wrapping up
 
03:56:56.359 --> 03:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could start wrapping up
okay

03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to answer questions
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
about these three Provisions which are
 
03:57:06.030 --> 03:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
geared at preventing poisoning in the
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
first place so requiring towns to have
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
the RP number on their building permit
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the Sugar Hill building
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
permit this is a oneline addition to a
 
03:57:17.070 --> 03:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
building permit it just says contractor
 
03:57:19.550 --> 03:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
name license number so they're already
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed this is just a
 
03:57:24.030 --> 03:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
simple prompt on a building permit and
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see in mayor lit's testimony that
 
03:57:28.349 --> 03:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
this simple prompt encouraged more
 
03:57:30.149 --> 03:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
contractors in the City of Claremont to
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
become RRP certified and to engage in
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
lead safe practices it also lets
 
03:57:36.670 --> 03:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners know that there's lead
 
03:57:39.030 --> 03:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
hazards in their home I think that
 
03:57:40.990 --> 03:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
people are often under the assumption
 
03:57:42.910 --> 03:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a problem we have solved
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is a simple way of letting people
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
know this problem is still there than
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
you I really do need you to wrap up
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you does the committee have any
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods um thank
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
you uh for thank for taking my question
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
um this this license um especially in
 
03:58:07.389 --> 03:58:07.399 align:start position:0%
some of the more rural areas does that
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
impact the the ability uh because or
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
does everybody all the contractors have
 
03:58:17.070 --> 03:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
this as a matter of fact or is this
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to impact uh people being able to
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
do repairs on their
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
home thank you for the question so the
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
contractors are already required to be
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
RRP certified this bill does not put any
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
new requirements onto them so that's a
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
federal law it also applies in certain
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
situations under epa's RP law and so
 
03:58:42.189 --> 03:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
this just prompts when they're doing um
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
Renovations on a home when submitting a
 
03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
building permit to provide that number
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
um and I I think um mayor claremont's
 
03:58:51.910 --> 03:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I mean I'm sorry mayor lett's
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
testimony about the Claremont experience
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
does speak to how a community um
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
benefited from this
 
03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
provision follow yes follow I'm not sure
 
03:59:05.550 --> 03:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
I asked the right question um if you're
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
in a rural area um and the someone wants
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
a renovation done they go to get a
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
permit well the F contractor do doesn't
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a license now is that is that a a
 
03:59:18.000 --> 03:59:19.229 align:start position:0%
have a license now is that is that a a
significant

03:59:19.229 --> 03:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
imposition uh in any way to to get
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
remediation thank you for the question
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of how many unlicensed
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
contractors were out there working I
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
mean that would be in violation of
 
03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
existing law so I can't speak to that
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
but I can say that the communities that
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
have put this into the place are kind of
 
03:59:37.469 --> 03:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
varied across the street so we have um
 
03:59:40.750 --> 03:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill Waterville Valley Easton
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
marac um Madbury Claremont these are a
 
03:59:46.830 --> 03:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
variety of communities who are um
 
03:59:48.269 --> 03:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
recognizing it's important to get this
 
03:59:49.870 --> 03:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
on their form and I I don't think it's
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
been an impediment um I'll also add the
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
municipal Association um has um told me
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
and authorized me to say on their behalf
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
that they don't think this provision
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
will add any cost to
 
04:00:07.149 --> 04:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank you representative
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
delus thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:00:12.670 --> 04:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so when you when
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
you say contractor are you talking
 
04:00:18.550 --> 04:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
construction contractor or painting
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
contractor thank you for the question so
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
it is anybody engaged in work under
 
04:00:26.389 --> 04:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
epa's RRP law and so that's renovation
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
repair and painting of pre-1978 housing
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a very specific set of work
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
that triggers this provision okay and it
 
04:00:36.910 --> 04:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
is anybody engaged in that work so if
 
04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
you have a home that was built in 2019
 
04:00:41.910 --> 04:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh this wouldn't never apply to that or
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
a new build house this wouldn't apply
 
04:00:45.990 --> 04:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a specific rule for people who
 
04:00:48.670 --> 04:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
are engaged in work in that has to deal
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
with lead hazards under this Federal
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
rule any yes representative Lucas thank
 
04:00:58.349 --> 04:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thanks for taking my
 
04:01:02.229 --> 04:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
question um wondering about the
 
04:01:04.750 --> 04:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
situation at least in my community comes
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
up quite often and people do their own
 
04:01:10.510 --> 04:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
renovation they don't hire a
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
contractor how is this going to address
 
04:01:17.309 --> 04:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
the situation if at all thank you so
 
04:01:20.110 --> 04:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
often the RRP rule does not apply to
 
04:01:22.590 --> 04:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
home renovations in people's own homes
 
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
um and it is really tragic and I I don't
 
04:01:27.550 --> 04:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
have the data but I've talked to a lot
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
of lead experts about why is this where
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
is this increase in Poison kids coming
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
from and some people do speculate that
 
04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
there is a bump in DIY home projects
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
particularly since the pandemic we were
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
all home we were all doing work in our
 
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
homes um perhaps and again I don't have
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
data to back this up perhaps that's one
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why kids are we we're
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
seeing these increased numbers so this
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
provision wouldn't impact you know the
 
04:01:57.309 --> 04:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
DIY I'm going to go um paint my hallway
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
um but as a whole you know I'm trying to
 
04:02:02.309 --> 04:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
get the word out about this I think the
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
report I think the provision on a
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
building P firm uh permit prompts a
 
04:02:10.469 --> 04:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
conversation in communities um and and
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
people go to fill up their form they see
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
it there you look at these building
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
forms now it say what are the Wetland
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
impacts what are this that that what are
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
lead paint is not on there it should be
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
people should be thinking of this where
 
04:02:22.750 --> 04:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
do I live where do my neighbors live so
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's to raise awareness and the same
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
with the rebuttable presumption is to
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
raise awareness to this problem and I I
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
I'm telling everybody I can you know we
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
we have not solved this problem of lead
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning it is here we know what the
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
solutions are we know what the problem
 
04:02:38.429 --> 04:02:38.439 align:start position:0%
is so it's it's part of that effort um
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
but I don't have a a perfect solution
 
04:02:44.349 --> 04:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
for inhome projects thank you anyone
 
04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
else any further questions thank you
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%

ahead of time that this is um a no CA
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
solution to the lead poisoning
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
prevention epidemic that's really been
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
happening in our states for years and
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
years and years for context I worked at
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:03:59.309 --> 04:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
Services 10 years ago and we were
 
04:04:01.229 --> 04:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
working on this very issue and I feel
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
like it's um Deja Vu uh what I really
 
04:04:05.469 --> 04:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
just wanted to focus on in this
 
04:04:06.830 --> 04:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
legislation in
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
particular is um while we made a lot of
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
changes through S SP uh 248 in 2018
 
04:04:17.149 --> 04:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
that uh were really great steps um
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
regarding um childhood Le pre prevention
 
04:04:22.590 --> 04:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
policies there was a huge step back with
 
04:04:22.600 --> 04:04:23.349 align:start position:0%
policies there was a huge step back with
that

04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um so prior to 2018 the
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
department um had the authority to when
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
it had um a lead hazard in one housing
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
unit the agency would be able to inspect
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
other units within that building to
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
check for lead this was just common
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
sense primary prevention you don't want
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
a kid to be the canary and the coal mine
 
04:04:47.149 --> 04:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
if you know that there was a kid in
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
another unit who was poisoned you should
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
be able to check the other units um that
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
was change in s SP 248 and I think that
 
04:04:57.389 --> 04:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
was a big step back in terms of primary
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
prevention this bill fixes that and my
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is the department is um on
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
board with that so it does uh also
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
identify other um solutions to which um
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
Heidi spoke about of which we are in
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
favor um but I would just really ask
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
this committee to um consider this bill
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
um closely as further steps we can take
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
to prevent our kids and keep them safe
 
04:05:24.030 --> 04:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
and I ask you to vote a to pass thank
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
you does the committee have any
 
04:05:33.229 --> 04:05:33.239 align:start position:0%

probably about 35 years I've got a
 
04:06:25.750 --> 04:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
number of properties myself that are
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
older I've been very involved in the
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
lead world so to speak I've served on
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
two year-long Le commissions I've served
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
on a committee that rewrote the rules
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
for Led in the state of New Hampshire I
 
04:06:43.950 --> 04:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
teach the RRP course that people been
 
04:06:47.550 --> 04:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
talking about and I have a very large
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge and background on the subject
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
of lead so I would like to invite
 
04:06:55.950 --> 04:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
everyone to be asking me questions to
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
get in perspective from a property
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
owner's position there are tremendous
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
amount of problems with this bill and
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
the cost that it will in uh create it is
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely not a no cost solution I'm
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
sorry to hear that that's been
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
represented to you I've got a lot of
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
things to say I have talking points that
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
I will pass out a copy I have emailed
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
you last night and I probably won't have
 
04:07:26.950 --> 04:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
enough time to go through it but I
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
invite you to ask
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions so I just get started and I
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
guess you have to pull the hook at some
 
04:07:37.950 --> 04:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
point um landlords did not create the
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
the lead hazards this the use of lead
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
based paint was dramatically um popular
 
04:07:47.109 --> 04:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
it was the best functional paint ever
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
invented unfortunately it was extremely
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
poisonous at the same time it was very
 
04:07:55.389 --> 04:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
commonly used very much recommended to
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
be used and it's just a plague on our
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
society it's a societal problem it
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
should not be placed to one set of
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders namely housing providers to
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
brunt the full cost of this and every
 
04:08:12.510 --> 04:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
time there's a piece of legislation it's
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
always aimed
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
at um forcing housing providers to to
 
04:08:21.910 --> 04:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
pay for this solution which is not
 
04:08:23.950 --> 04:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
something they created it was it was
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
part of our society the cost of
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
abatement uh ranges all over the place
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
if you have a little bit of work to do
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a little bit of a cost
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
if you got a lot of work to do because
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
nothing's been done over the years it's
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a large cost but there is an
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
average in the last set of grants that
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
were in Sullivan County the average cost
 
04:08:47.710 --> 04:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
was 30,000 per unit in nashwa it was
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
28,000 per unit and in Statewide it was
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
26,000 per unit so if you have an 8un
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
building and you find out that there was
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
one child that had an elevation and the
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
present law says any other units with
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
children will be inspected and you end
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
up with three units in the building that
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
come under order now that's three *
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
$30,000 that's $90,000
 
04:09:18.030 --> 04:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
average it's not you know precisely that
 
04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
number but if we switch back to
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
inspecting all
 
04:09:25.229 --> 04:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
units then that will become eight units
 
04:09:27.910 --> 04:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
under a batement order that'll be 8 time
 
04:09:30.550 --> 04:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
30 that'll be
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
$240,000 how can you say moving from
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
90,000 to
 
04:09:38.590 --> 04:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
$240,000 is no cost solution sir if you
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
could please start wrapping up there's
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
probably three hours more to talk about
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
um sorry if you have written testimony
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
we'd be glad to see that so testing data
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
let's talk about that in 2010 you are
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to need to start wrapping up
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
certain this will be a wrap up then okay
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
the 10 2010 177% of the children tested
 
04:10:06.189 --> 04:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
measured between 5 and N micrograms per
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
deciliter people are talking about so
 
04:10:12.030 --> 04:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
much more uh elevations in
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.469 --> 04:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
49% we've done an amazing job in
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of lead poisoning in
 
04:10:23.950 --> 04:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
children and it's because the property
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
owners have been buring the face of this
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
and paying for re Renovations and
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
eliminating lead hazards thank you go
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
ahead in courtesy to other speakers I
 
04:10:34.520 --> 04:10:35.309 align:start position:0%
ahead in courtesy to other speakers I
will

04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
have we would be glad to have you email
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
that us so we can really look at what
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
you have I emailed this last night
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's one update to it that I have
 
04:10:45.790 --> 04:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
another link to have referred to okay
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to say about the RRP
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
that's been misrepresented thank you
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
I'll open up uh to committee questions
 
04:10:53.119 --> 04:10:55.070 align:start position:0%
I'll open up uh to committee questions
representative

04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
delus thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you is
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
there if this let's say you've you've
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
got that scenario you've got your eight
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
units they come in they check need needs
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:11:12.269 --> 04:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
remediated is there any recourse with
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
insurance or anything like that no no
 
04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
there is um
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
HUD offers grant
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
money and the state of New Hampshire has
 
04:11:27.109 --> 04:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
some grants from HUD to do L
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
abatements the the crazy thing about it
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that you could use RRP to handle the
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
renovation to get the property back to
 
04:11:43.710 --> 04:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
an Abad safe State at half the the cost
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
abatement thank you any other questions
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
lontine um thank you and I was going to
 
04:12:00.670 --> 04:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
ask the same question about grants and
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
have you used grants yourself to help
 
04:12:08.830 --> 04:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
pay for the abatements I have and the
 
04:12:11.950 --> 04:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
process is is fraught with several
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
problems the Grant so the grant money
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
can be a godsend if you've been given an
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
abatement order you have no choice it's
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
like you're going to have to either pay
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
all of this money or you turn in the
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
keys and you lose the property because
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
you can't afford it and that's happened
 
04:12:34.510 --> 04:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
many many many times to Property Owners
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
you got someone that eats some
 
04:12:39.149 --> 04:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
applesauce that was tainted with lead in
 
04:12:41.710 --> 04:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
2023 and now they have an elevation and
 
04:12:45.070 --> 04:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
now the property is put under order so
 
04:12:47.469 --> 04:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
yes I've used the grant money
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and I've learned a lot about
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
it and some of the issues with it is
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
that the grants are approved not based
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
on the property owner the grant is
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
approved based on the income of the
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
tenants so if the tenants income is
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
above what HUD allows you don't get the
 
04:13:12.149 --> 04:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
Grant and you're still under order and
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
the Grant and the the baitman is the
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
most expensive way to handle the
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
solution it can be handled at almost no
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
cost thank you representative Sebert did
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
you have a question um that kind of
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
covered it okay any other
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you

04:14:52.830 --> 04:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
chief of Environmental Health in the
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester so I had a lot of
 
04:14:57.389 --> 04:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
firsthand experience with lead poisoning
 
04:15:00.109 --> 04:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
during my career over my more than 30
 
04:15:01.269 --> 04:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
years of Public Health I've had
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
extensive involvement in the serious
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
problem of childhood lead poisoning
 
04:15:06.990 --> 04:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately despite years of effort to
 
04:15:09.070 --> 04:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
Institute Common Sense primary
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
prevention of lead poisoning we are
 
04:15:12.510 --> 04:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
still waiting for children to become
 
04:15:14.590 --> 04:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
poisoned and even having their brains
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
permanently harmed before we took action
 
04:15:19.630 --> 04:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
the most devastating consequential event
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
in my public health career was leading
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
the investigation of a death of a
 
04:15:26.070 --> 04:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
2-year-old child in
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester as a result of lead poisoning
 
04:15:28.439 --> 04:15:29.149 align:start position:0%
Manchester as a result of lead poisoning
in

04:15:29.149 --> 04:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
2000 this child having arrived as a
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
refugee was placed in a home in
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester with serious lived hazards
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
within two months she suffered aute lead
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
poisoning as a result of ingesting lead
 
04:15:43.229 --> 04:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
paint with a lead content of 35% by
 
04:15:46.349 --> 04:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
weight her blood lead level was
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
391 micrograms per deciliter I'm still
 
04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
haunted by that
 
04:15:55.389 --> 04:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
investigation yet even with the death of
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
almost almost 25 years ago we are still
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
refusing to properly prevent and manage
 
04:16:02.910 --> 04:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
this ongoing crisis in fact a recent
 
04:16:06.750 --> 04:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
state report as you saw that uh 1142
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
children have been reported with
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
elevated blood levels the highest number
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
ever reported and probably a very
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
under reported number because of the
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
lack of testing of all children age 1
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
and two it is long pass time for New
 
04:16:21.510 --> 04:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to start treating lead
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
poisoning like every other disease we
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
need to put prevention first a number of
 
04:16:28.109 --> 04:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
years ago when the New Hampshire notice
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
loons dying of lead poisoning for
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
ingesting lead fishing tackle as a
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
result the legislature acted very
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
swiftly to ban the use of lead in
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
freshwater fishing tank this was the
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
right thing to do if we can do this for
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
loons why can't we take aggressive
 
04:16:46.830 --> 04:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
action to prevent lead poisoning amongst
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
our precious
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
children not only are human costs of
 
04:16:53.950 --> 04:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
lead Point enormous so are the economic
 
04:16:55.950 --> 04:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
costs the medical expenses special
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
education costs criminal justice costs
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
are huge a 1991 CDC report concluded
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
that the US pre-1950 this is pre-1950
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
housing for which 80% contend lead paint
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
were baited the cost savings over the
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
cost of the bait over 20 years would be
 
04:17:14.000 --> 04:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
cost of the bait over 20 years would be
$28

04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
$28
 
04:17:18.510 --> 04:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
billion at any rate the money saved by
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
governments individuals and communities
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
would be vastly more than the cost of
 
04:17:24.990 --> 04:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
abatement we've been kicking this can
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
down the road for over 50 years while
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
children continue to become poison as
 
04:17:31.469 --> 04:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
Einstein said continuing to do the same
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
thing over and over again and expecting
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
different results is a definition of
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
insanity although the symptoms of lead
 
04:17:40.990 --> 04:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
poisoning are silent responsible leaders
 
04:17:43.149 --> 04:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
and child Advocates cannot continue to
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
remain silent about what needs to be
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
done to end this epidemic New Hampshire
 
04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
could make history by putting in place a
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
primary prevention system to finally end
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
the scourge of child poisoning while we
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
cannot undo the harm caused by our past
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
neglect we can celebrate commitment to
 
04:18:01.109 --> 04:18:01.119 align:start position:0%
the future generation of children thank
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you be happy to answer any
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you does the committee
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
have any
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
questions yes yes representative Sebert
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um I just well I was kind of a
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
statement I just wanted to say thank you
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
for coming to justify and I know what
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I actually saw that
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
on an episode of Forensic Files um yeah
 
04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
so do you believe that our um our
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
citizens deserve to be you know very for
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
for when they move into a property let's
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
say whether they're renting it or buying
 
04:18:34.830 --> 04:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
it they deserve to have a clear like
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
have it on the RFP may have it made
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
clear to them that whether the house has
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
Le or not well uh thank you for the
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
question I think uh right now there is a
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that if you sell a house if
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
you have led you have to you have to
 
04:18:51.229 --> 04:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
disclose that uh to the prospective
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
buyers that includes people who buy
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
rental properties when they buy a rental
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
property whether it has two five or 10
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
units they know before they buy that
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
property whether it has lead hazards in
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
it so they are buying a property with a
 
04:19:10.349 --> 04:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge that if they don't do anything
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
to those units that have lead
 
04:19:14.910 --> 04:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be renting it to
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
people so they know it ahead of time so
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
once a child becomes lead poison they
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be surprised by the fact that
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
a child became lead poison they should
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
have known it ahead of time when they
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
bought the property and maybe could have
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
negotiated a lower price for that
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
property because of the existing lead
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
Hazard thank you representative
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
Lucas thank you and thanks for
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
testifying today um how long has that
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
been in effect um that the disclosure of
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
fled in property oh I'm not sure exactly
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
but at least at least 20 years at least
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the exact date but thank
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further
 
04:19:55.630 --> 04:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you ma'am
 
04:19:55.640 --> 04:19:56.469 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you ma'am
thank

04:19:56.469 --> 04:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
Ellis we ask that you keep your
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
testimony to three minutes
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.830 --> 04:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
um to The Honorable chair and members of
 
04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
the health human services and elderly
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee my name is Molly Ellis
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of
 
04:20:25.630 --> 04:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
keen and I'm here today to ask you to
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
vote in support of House Bill 724 and I
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
apologize that I did not see the
 
04:20:33.870 --> 04:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
amendment before I wrote my testimony so
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
that threw me off a tiny bit but um a
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
few years ago I received news that my
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
son's lead level was elevated so I went
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
on a mission to learn all that I could
 
04:20:48.189 --> 04:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
about lead poisoning and I learned that
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
the level considered to be safe has been
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
lowered repeatedly over the years
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
because doctors have learned that even
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
very low levels can cause harm and in
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
fact there's no safe level of lead and
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
the blood and I realized that the
 
04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill does um scratch
 
04:21:10.750 --> 04:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
that requirement for lowering the
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
maximum level permitted in the blood
 
04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
before Public Health gets involved but I
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
think that speaks to the importance of
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill now the only
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um the importance of of
 
04:21:28.750 --> 04:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
contractors um using proper lead safe
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
techniques when when doing renovations
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
our home is a fixer
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
uper um and we had done lots of projects
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
on it and any disturbance to materials
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
containing lead such as sawing scraping
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
sanding creates increased exposure to
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
lead and that's probably what caused our
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
Suns lead poisoning um as homes are the
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
the primary the primary um reason

04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
poisoning
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
um the most effective way to prevent red
 
04:22:08.710 --> 04:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning is to be aware of the
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
presence of lead and to use lead safe
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
for mediation techniques when when doing
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
renovation so please vote in favor of
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 724 and thank you for your
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
time and
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you are you taking
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
questions yes does the committee have
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
any yes representative Drew thanks for
 
04:22:30.990 --> 04:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:22:33.710 --> 04:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
question going back I I I may have
 
04:22:36.670 --> 04:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
missed it are you renting did you buy we
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
own our home you own your home yes
 
04:22:41.630 --> 04:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
follow up were you notified that you had
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
a lead hazard in your home when you
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
purchased it uh we knew that because it
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
was built in 1850 it contained
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
lead okay so I mean I I'm sure it was on
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
some of those pages of that we that we
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
signed but we were aware we just but we
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
did not we were not aware uh we just
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
assumed oh you just paint over it you
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
know we we were not aware um that that
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
painting over it doesn't solve it we
 
04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
were not aware that that there are
 
04:23:13.870 --> 04:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
really specific legally defined
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
techniques for safely remediating
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
lead thank you any further
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none appreciate
 
04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:43.109 --> 04:23:43.119 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon um my name is
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
Katie Hatcher this is Kim Bernard we
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
work at the NASA division of Public
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
Health and Community Services I'm a
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
public health nurse I'm also the lead
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the program and Kim is
 
04:23:55.870 --> 04:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
nurse good afternoon we wholeheartedly
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
support and recommend the changes to
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
section three that states when a child
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
living in a rental unit is identified as
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
being poisoned that all other units in
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
the dwelling should be inspected
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
regardless if there are pregnant women
 
04:24:14.149 --> 04:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
or children under the age of six living
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
in these units in my six years working
 
04:24:19.389 --> 04:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
in lead poisoning prevention I can tell
 
04:24:21.149 --> 04:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
you that if there is lead paint in one
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
unit there is likely lead paint in other
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
units with this change in lead
 
04:24:29.550 --> 04:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
inspection laws we have the opportunity
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
for primary
 
04:24:32.910 --> 04:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
prevention which is preventing lead
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
poisoning before it happens New
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not focus on primary
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
prevention for lead poisoning and that
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
narrative has to change n just received
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
a $7.7 million Grant um for lead
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
remediation that distributes $30,000 per
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
unit for lead Hazard reduction um
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
listening to the other testimony here as
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
a parent and a nurse it hurts my soul to
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
hear that our children's Futures are not
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
worth the cost um I'd also like to point
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
out that we are really disappointed and
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
discouraged to hear about the amendment
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
to drop the language of lowering the
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
Action level from 5 micrograms per
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
deciliter to 3.5 which is in line with
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
the CDC if we don't do it now then we
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
need to do it soon research shows that
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
even very lowlevel exposures cause
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
irreversible lifelong cognitive and
 
04:25:24.269 --> 04:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
behavioral deficits I've been working in
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
the lead poisoning prevention program in
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for many years when the
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
Action level was 10 micrograms per
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
deciliter I was there for the transition
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 7.5 and then 7.5 to 5 we can
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
transition from 5 to
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
3.5 DHHS estimates that 280 children
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
fall between the par parameters of 3.5
 
04:25:46.030 --> 04:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
and 5 micrograms per deciliter that is
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
280 children in New Hampshire that we
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to approve improve
 
04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
the Outlook of their Futures and help
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
them reach their full
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
potential we're happy to take
 
04:25:59.790 --> 04:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
questions the committee have any
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative L montine
 
04:26:05.070 --> 04:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
question we received some email
 
04:26:10.590 --> 04:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that uh we're focusing too
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
much on on
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
exposures in the home and not enough on
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
nutrition and other causes but isn't it
 
04:26:22.830 --> 04:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
true that um better nutrition might
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the damage from L
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
exposure but the primary cause is is the
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
exposure itself that's an excellent
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
question um and thank you for asking it
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
and giving us the opportunity to answer
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
so primarily um in New Hampshire lead
 
04:26:41.910 --> 04:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
paint is the primary source of exposure
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
we do do see other exposure sources
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
through imported products um food
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
sources and other things um as far as
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition yes children that have lead
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
exposures typically um if they have a
 
04:26:56.910 --> 04:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
nutritional deficit they will hold on to
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
lead in their body a lot longer than
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
children that don't so we do use
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
nutrition as a counseling um tool to
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
help families with that that being said
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
um it is not the only tool that we have
 
04:27:10.750 --> 04:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of children that have lead
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning do um subsequently become
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
anemic so certainly we we monitor the
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
nutrition but it is not a fail
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
safe thank you any further
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%

important bill forward I'm here today to
 
04:28:08.309 --> 04:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
speak in Urgent support of the proposed
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
legislation over the last couple of
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
years I've worked I've been closely
 
04:28:14.269 --> 04:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
involved involved with the formation of
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
the city's lead exposure prevention
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
commission I worked for over a year with
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
retired State Rep Mary Heath and former
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%

alexos alongside several other concerned
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
members of the public and advocacy
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
groups to see that this commission was
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
formed the commission has 12 members and
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
consists of landlords property managers
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%

like myself and importantly we also have
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
members with lived experience this is a
 
04:28:53.229 --> 04:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
broad Coalition of Highly concerned and
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
motivated stakeholders and it enjoys
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
widespread support across our city prior
 
04:29:00.990 --> 04:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
to my work on the commission I knew that
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
lead exposure was of course a problem I
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
had very little idea to the extent of
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
the problem and more so the prevalence
 
04:29:10.469 --> 04:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
of the problem especially in
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester this particular detail has
 
04:29:15.309 --> 04:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
always stood out in my mind as I think
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
it is the most essential thing it's
 
04:29:19.070 --> 04:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
already been stated but I think it Bears
 
04:29:21.630 --> 04:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
repeating this a direct quote from
 
04:29:24.550 --> 04:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
deputy director alexos when making a
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
presentation to the board of alderman in
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
2023 lead is a toxic substance there is
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
no safe level of lead and I cannot say
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
that enough the body has absolutely no
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
use for lead and it interferes with both
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
calcium and iron absorption which are
 
04:29:43.870 --> 04:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
directly involved in the development of
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
tissues and the nervous system and the
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
skeletal system it can have not only
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
acute effects but it can result in death
 
04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
about as it's been pointed out we are
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
seeing a rise in exposure and and
 
04:30:02.349 --> 04:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
poisonings that cannot be exclusively
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
exclusively attributed to increased
 
04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
testing so I won't go into the details
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
of that uh but something that stands out
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
to me as a potential cause and we know
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
there's no single or straightforward
 
04:30:14.830 --> 04:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
answer as to why we're seeing this
 
04:30:17.550 --> 04:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
increase but uh what I wanted to speak
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
today about is uh the increased focus on
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
alleviating the how housing shortages
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
across our state as more and more
 
04:30:29.790 --> 04:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
buildings are renovated rehabbed and
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
repurposed for housing so too will rise
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
the risk of lead exposure and
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
poisoning we should fully expect that
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
the number of children poisoned will go
 
04:30:41.239 --> 04:30:43.229 align:start position:0%
the number of children poisoned will go
up

04:30:43.229 --> 04:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
to put a much finer point on it more
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
housing equals more lead poisoning and
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up um I'll leave you with this
 
04:30:54.189 --> 04:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
final data point and I think it's also
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
been spoken about the idea of the cost
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
in dollars and cents we know that
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
everyone pays the price including
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
landlords and other housing providers
 
04:31:05.990 --> 04:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
but it's estimated that for every dollar
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
spent to reduce lead poisoning there is
 
04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
a social return on investment between
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
$17 and $21
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
this should not be seen as an expense
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
but rather as a smart investment it
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
should not be seen as a p punishment to
 
04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
housing providers but rather a public
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
health requirement that our state
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
supports primary prevention is good math
 
04:31:28.030 --> 04:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
it's good for everyone and it's
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
essential for our children thank you
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
04:31:40.309 --> 04:31:40.319 align:start position:0%

Services if the committee wouldn't mind
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to bring Beverly drwan up

department will focus its testimony on
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment um as opposed to the
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
original bill is that
 
04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
okay with the committee sure okay so
 
04:32:47.070 --> 04:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
although the department is not taking a
 
04:32:49.149 --> 04:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as amended um we
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
would like to thank the bill sponsor for
 
04:32:53.950 --> 04:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
supporting efforts to reduce childhood
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh Le poisoning and we are happy to be a
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
resource to the committee and our
 
04:32:59.790 --> 04:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions that you
 
04:33:01.950 --> 04:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
may have and with that I'll turn it over
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
to Beverly to continue thank you so the
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
department recently published our 2023
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning in the Hampshire data
 
04:33:10.590 --> 04:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
brief which I believe you all have in
 
04:33:14.109 --> 04:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
the data brief the 20 23 data shows that
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
1,142 New Hampshire children had
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
elevated blood leads high enough to
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
impair their ability to think learn and
 
04:33:23.230 --> 04:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
concentrate the data in the brief also
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
indicates that lead safe Housing
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
Initiative support primary prevention
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
efforts since the bill Bill's been
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
amended to remove the provisions to
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
lower the blood Le Action level from
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
five uh micrograms of deciliter of whole
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
blood to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact to the department
 
04:33:45.390 --> 04:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
should this amended Bill be enacted have
 
04:33:47.310 --> 04:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
significantly changed from the original
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
estimate in the Department's fiscal note
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
worksheet the department originally
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
estimated the need for additional
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
funding to support activities associated
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
with increase in lead poisoning cases
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
that that would need environmental and
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
nurse case management as a result of
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
lowering the blood Le Action level to
 
04:34:09.390 --> 04:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
the cdc's blood Le reference value of
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
3.5 since this provision has been
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
removed from the bill the department
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
does not anticipate significant fiscal
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
impacts associated with the remaining
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions specifically the department
 
04:34:24.029 --> 04:34:24.039 align:start position:0%
is not anticipating significant
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
increases in expenditures as a result of
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment to RSA 13A
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
semicolon 6 to require the department to
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
conduct inspections for the purposes of
 
04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
identifying the present of lead-based
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
substances in all the other dwelling
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
units within a multi unit building that
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
have been identified as having a child
 
04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
with an elevated blood Le level residing
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:34:50.551 --> 04:34:50.561 align:start position:0%
building since the department will
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
already be on site on site to conduct an
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
inspection in a dwelling unit of the
 
04:34:58.150 --> 04:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
impacted child the inspector could also
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
in conduct inspections of the additional
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
dwelling units within the building at
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
the same time any additional work
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
related to this provision can be
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
addressed with existing program
 
04:35:12.189 --> 04:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
resources this provision supports
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts by addressing lead
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
hazards in the building before a child
 
04:35:16.561 --> 04:35:18.670 align:start position:0%
hazards in the building before a child
is

04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:21.709 --> 04:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
poisoned the department is also not
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
anticipating an increasing expenditures
 
04:35:25.869 --> 04:35:25.879 align:start position:0%
as a result of the proposed addition of
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
the rebuttable presumption that all
 
04:35:30.470 --> 04:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
dwelling and dwelling units including
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
residential rental units erected prior
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
to January 1st 1978 are presumed to
 
04:35:38.670 --> 04:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
contain lead based substances unless a
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
licensed lead inspector has determined
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
that the dwell dwelling or the dwelling
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
units do not contain lead-based
 
04:35:48.189 --> 04:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
substances in addition the bill proposes
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
a new section RSA 13A semicolon 4A that
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
requires all building permit
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
applications submitted in the state of
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to include the US EPA
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
renovation and repair the RRP license
 
04:36:04.590 --> 04:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
number the department would like to
 
04:36:06.429 --> 04:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee that we don't
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
have the authority over the issuance of
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
building permits thank you for the
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide this information
 
04:36:15.310 --> 04:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
Michelle and I are both happy to answer
 
04:36:17.670 --> 04:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have okay
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
04:36:27.869 --> 04:36:27.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
Drew thank you for taking my question if
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
a dhss inspector has cleared a
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
particular unit or a particular building
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
if a lead Hazard is then found in that
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
building does that transfer the
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
liability to the
 
04:36:47.070 --> 04:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
state so in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly a licens l
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh licensed risk assessor is the only
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
person who can clear a unit they're the
 
04:36:57.629 --> 04:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
people who go into the unit to determine
 
04:37:00.990 --> 04:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
there's no more lead hazards so if a
 
04:37:02.590 --> 04:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
unit has been
 
04:37:06.750 --> 04:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
cleared and another child has a blood
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
elevation then that unit uh we would go
 
04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
back and we would conduct an
 
04:37:13.390 --> 04:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
investigation to find out what failed in
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
that abatement or if there's new hazards
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
that have sprung up or arrived since the
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
building was cleared does that answer
 
04:37:21.840 --> 04:37:23.789 align:start position:0%
building was cleared does that answer
your

04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
follow not entirely no the issue I'm I'm
 
04:37:31.869 --> 04:37:31.879 align:start position:0%
specifically concerned about is legal
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
liability in other words what it seems
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
like and I realize this is a much
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
broader question I'm just it when when
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
the state is doing this inspection the
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
state is saying
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
that this building does not have lead
 
04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
hazards and if it's then later found
 
04:37:47.709 --> 04:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
that that building does have lead lead
 
04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
hazards does that liability simply fall
 
04:37:51.990 --> 04:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the landlord again or does it
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
transfer to the state because the state
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
was the one who said that the building
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
was clear does that make sense um can
 
04:38:00.269 --> 04:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
you speak to that yeah I think I can so
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
lead hazards are a moment in time so
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example so if I paint
 
04:38:09.150 --> 04:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
my staircase and it's all painted and
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's pristine and there's no hazards
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's no chipping or painting but then
 
04:38:16.750 --> 04:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
my husband moves a couch or Bureau up
 
04:38:18.551 --> 04:38:18.561 align:start position:0%
the staircase and bangs it and there's
 
04:38:21.629 --> 04:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
chips 10 minutes later there's hazards
 
04:38:23.551 --> 04:38:23.561 align:start position:0%
so when the department goes on site to
 
04:38:25.629 --> 04:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
do an investigation an inspection to
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
determine if a child that had an
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
elevation they are if there's lead
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
hazards in the building and we find that
 
04:38:34.109 --> 04:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
there are no lead hazards no chipping no
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
friction no impact no chewable it's that
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
moment in time and then maybe a day
 
04:38:44.189 --> 04:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
later 10 days later a month later
 
04:38:45.551 --> 04:38:45.561 align:start position:0%
there's a child with a blood Le
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
elevation there could be new hazards
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
there that we didn't see and that
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
landlord is there anything you want to
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
add so potentially a landlord could be
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
put in the lead abatement process more
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
than once
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Kofa thank you Mr
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
question so just as a point of
 
04:39:18.750 --> 04:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
clarification so if I'm a housing
 
04:39:21.949 --> 04:39:21.959 align:start position:0%
provider and I want to get a lead safe
 
04:39:25.150 --> 04:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
certificate um am am I calling upon a
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
state inspector or am I calling upon a
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
licensed risk assessor who is an
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
independent party you are correct you
 
04:39:34.590 --> 04:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
are calling on an independent New
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license risk assessor to give
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.440 --> 04:39:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
other

04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:39:46.510 --> 04:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:39:50.670 --> 04:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
McGrath so um this is thank you Mr chair
 
04:39:52.150 --> 04:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for take my question so this
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
is important work but I've heard people
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
mention things like applesauce and other
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
sources of lead how do how do we assess
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that um maybe the child has been exposed
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
some to some other source like where how
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
does that
 
04:40:16.270 --> 04:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
those cases get discovered so our data
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
tells us that of the children who have
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
blood Le elevations 70% of those
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
children have been exposed to hazards
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
from the built environment the house 15%
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
are from consumer products and 15% of
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
those are from drinking water so when we
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
go do an
 
04:40:36.510 --> 04:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
investigation um Katie Hatcher is one of
 
04:40:38.190 --> 04:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
the people who spoke earlier who does
 
04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
investigations on behalf of the state
 
04:40:42.628 --> 04:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
she's a nurse a contracted nurse to the
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
state she'll go out and interview with
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the family to find
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
out that Child's Play Habits eating
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
habits where they go and where they act
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
so we can identify where the source of
 
04:40:58.750 --> 04:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Sarah Holland
 
04:41:28.910 --> 04:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
Realtors good afternoon thank you Mr
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
chair thank you committee um my name is
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
Sarah Holland I am a real estate broker
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
in central New Hampshire and I am the
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
current chair of public policy for the
 
04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association Realtors the
 
04:41:44.910 --> 04:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
Realtors have concerns um about this
 
04:41:47.070 --> 04:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding the timing and
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
adding to the already um escalated
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that we have and this is
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
a very narrow objection on this
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um so with this legislation
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a concern with one unit then
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a concern to
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
mitigate all units in a particular
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
building and as Mr Norman had noted
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's an added cost for that and
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be coming through either
 
04:42:12.990 --> 04:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
grant program or it's going to be coming
 
04:42:14.590 --> 04:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
out of the pocket of that particular
 
04:42:17.550 --> 04:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
landlord and that creates additional
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
Financial strain and that Financial
 
04:42:23.070 --> 04:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
strain creates a lot of uncertainty for
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
those tenants number one in in the
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
mitigation process those tenants are
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to need to vacate that property
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
and currently there's nowhere to go so
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
if there's one unit that needs to be
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
vacated in a building that's difficult
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
enough in this current environment but
 
04:42:38.510 --> 04:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
if there are 10 or more units that need
 
04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
to be vacated that's that's exponential
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's really difficult to manage um
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
additionally when landlords struggle
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
with this they're going to need to come
 
04:42:51.990 --> 04:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
if they choose to put their property
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
back online for rent and allow those
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
tenants to move back in there might be
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
an an additional cost to rent for those
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
tenants or for future tenants so they
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
can make up these costs so these are all
 
04:43:06.670 --> 04:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
concerns the money has to come from from
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I know that there is a
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund um and we're happy to to
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
have conversations kind of outside of
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
this Committee hearing regarding how
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
much money is still in that fund how
 
04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
much we anticipate coming into that fund
 
04:43:21.628 --> 04:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
going forward so we can come up with
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of um solution last year we
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
passed legislation um that any new
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
residential conversions to rental so
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
existing homes that are now turning into
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
residential rentals needed to be
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
certified LED safe um prior to that
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
occupancy and that process is incredibly
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
slow and it is incredibly cumbersome and
 
04:43:45.310 --> 04:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
cost uh costly to folks that are looking
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
to do that and I know in my practice
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
folks who were looking to purchase those
 
04:43:51.868 --> 04:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
properties and turn them into rentals
 
04:43:53.430 --> 04:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
with this new legislation they've kind
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
of shied away from that so those
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
properties are not coming online as we
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
were hoping that they would in a safe
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
manner to help with this um with this
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
crisis um and most recently um I spoke
 
04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
with a a colleague who had a client that
 
04:44:11.110 --> 04:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
owns their own home and their child
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
tested um High Le levels and they are
 
04:44:15.868 --> 04:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
working through the process to get grant
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
funding to be able to mitigate that in
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
their own primary home however there's
 
04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
no place for them to go in the meantime
 
04:44:24.270 --> 04:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
and now they have this knowledge that
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
this house is poisoning their child
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
so these are concerns that need to be um
 
04:44:34.030 --> 04:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
that need to be thought through when
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
weighing this particular legislation we
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
do not have enough homes out there for
 
04:44:40.270 --> 04:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
folks to be able to move to during this
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation process C we don't have
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
enough homes period so we need new safe
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
homes out there for folks happy to take
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
any question actually hold on um
 
04:44:50.430 --> 04:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
something was mentioned earlier uh lead
 
04:44:52.750 --> 04:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
disclosures those lead disclosures need
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
to go out prior to the um in the sale
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
process everyone is going to be um
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
provided a lead disclosure for any
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
property that is pre1 1978 and also in
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
the Rental process any P prospective
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
tenant also needs to be Prov provided a
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
um a lead disclosure for properties that
 
04:45:18.030 --> 04:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
are older than 1978 as
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
well happy to take any questions thank
 
04:45:22.590 --> 04:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
you any
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative cber yeah I
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
just have a question I feel it to be
 
04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
pretty reasonable in regards to like you
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
know we do we do know that there are a
 
04:45:34.990 --> 04:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
lot of some people call them renovation
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
evictions but whatever they are when
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
when they do you know displace folks and
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to do a renovation on that
 
04:45:44.190 --> 04:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
property whether it's slapping on a pain
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
of coat coat of paint sorry paint of
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
coat a coat of paint or whatever it is
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
um upgrading a few things why would we
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
not do we require that to be Abad within
 
04:45:58.350 --> 04:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
that process I mean I understand it's
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and that type of a thing but
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
Al still is the law um we you know what
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
would be a solution for that for you
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
versus let's just keep leaving the
 
04:46:10.480 --> 04:46:11.430 align:start position:0%
versus let's just keep leaving the
situation

04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:46:13.788 --> 04:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
the way it is um if I could ask for a
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
clarification on your question are you
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
asking about folks that are um having
 
04:46:20.030 --> 04:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
tenants vacate so then they can do
 
04:46:21.628 --> 04:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
Renovations on their property that are
 
04:46:24.510 --> 04:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
not relative to lead paint yeah why
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
would you not address that at the same
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
time that's it I that's up to the
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
landlord I I can't answer that it does
 
04:46:33.948 --> 04:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
seem it does seem reasonable unless
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
there is a cost aspect of that is
 
04:46:40.548 --> 04:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
just cost prohibitive for them to do so
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
yeah all
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
right other
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:30.190 --> 04:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
then thank you chair members of the
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee so my name is uh Joan O'Brien
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm the president of the New
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire animal rights league and we
 
04:47:38.430 --> 04:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
were formed in
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
1977 so we've been around for almost 50
 
04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
years years and we are our mission is to
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
protect animals from Human induced forms
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
of harm so I wanted to speak to this
 
04:47:53.628 --> 04:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
bill today because I wanted to discuss a
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
a large a largely
 
04:47:57.910 --> 04:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
undiscussed um
 
04:48:01.708 --> 04:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
potential exposure to lead which is lead
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
in hunted meat and I attend the monthly
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing Game Commission
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
meetings and a few years ago the vendor
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
dor Scott Mason was discussing a a
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
ballistics demonstration that he had
 
04:48:18.750 --> 04:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
attended where they showed that a lead
 
04:48:21.310 --> 04:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
bullet is shedding lead all the way
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
through its path you know when if you
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
shoot an animal and he said and then
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
you've got lead in your meat so I
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
thought interesting and then later I
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
learned about there we have something
 
04:48:33.868 --> 04:48:33.878 align:start position:0%
called The Hunt For The Hungry program
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that is a program where you can
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
donate venison to the food bank and I
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
thought gosh I wonder if you know those
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
people are at risk that's a you know a
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population of people getting
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
food from the food bank maybe they're
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
getting meat with lead and so I did some
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
research into it and in fact you know if
 
04:48:54.788 --> 04:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
you shoot a lead bullet into an animal
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
the fragments lead fragments into a lot
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
of little pieces they can be 18 in from
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
the site where the bullet hit and
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
Hunters are accustomed to like field
 
04:49:07.868 --> 04:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
dressing their animal and they would cut
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
around you know the the place where the
 
04:49:12.670 --> 04:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
bullet hit but they might not get all of
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the fragments and um so
 
04:49:18.910 --> 04:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
I did call the food bank and the
 
04:49:20.628 --> 04:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
director there had never this had never
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
come up um and she said we have the meat
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
processed by approved butchers um but
 
04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
the butcher didn't call me back but I
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
read a study where they took 30 deer in
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
another state took 30 deer to 30
 
04:49:36.270 --> 04:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
different butchers and and tested the
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
ground meat and they found lead in 24 of
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
the samples so 24 out of 30
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
butchers um so it's I think it's just a
 
04:49:45.958 --> 04:49:47.670 align:start position:0%
butchers um so it's I think it's just a
largely

04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
largely
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
undiscussed exposure and I know that
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipients are all over the
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
state including in rural areas where
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
hunting is popular and um poaching is
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
also something that happens all over the
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
state and recently they fishing game
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
donated 350 lbs of poached meat to
 
04:50:14.110 --> 04:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where actually but you can
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
imagine somebody poaching an animal
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
might have shot it with a lead bullet
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
not probably not caring too much so I
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
did write an article about this which
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
was published in the New Hampshire
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
bulletin and
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah and we we to raise awareness we
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
tabled about this in 2022 at the N
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game um discover wild
 
04:50:38.990 --> 04:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire day and we had a petition
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm almost done we had a petition
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
we got 250 signatures asking the
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
department to take some action like a
 
04:50:49.230 --> 04:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
buyback program an ammo buyback program
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that so nothing's
 
04:50:52.750 --> 04:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
happened yet but I just couldn't resist
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to raise this and on
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
your website it doesn't mention hunted
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
meat as an exposure shooting Rangers are
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned but not hunted animals so
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any represent
 
04:51:08.750 --> 04:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
for sharing this concern with us uh so
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
obviously exposure is possible but do
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
you know of any case somebody was
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
poisoned uh by New Hampshire and needed
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
medical help because he or she were
 
04:51:29.948 --> 04:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
eating venison or some other haunted
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
meat I don't know of any you know data
 
04:51:36.270 --> 04:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
about that because I think it it's
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
largely undetected and people don't
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
think about it should be you know where
 
04:51:43.470 --> 04:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
from other
 
04:51:48.750 --> 04:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
04:51:48.760 --> 04:51:52.030 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
thank

04:51:52.030 --> 04:51:52.040 align:start position:0%

you okay I have no one else signed up to
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
testify does anybody else wish to

05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
like to reconvene and we have one bill
 
05:05:26.190 --> 05:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
left to be heard today and it's HB 756
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
FN uh the prime sponsor is
 
05:05:30.548 --> 05:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard and he is at
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
the W uh witness table and ready to go
 
05:05:35.788 --> 05:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
welcome back representative Howard thank
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
you honorable Mr chair and uh committee
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
members uh my name is representative
 
05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard I represent the towns of
 
05:05:43.230 --> 05:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
straford and barington in straford
 
05:05:46.510 --> 05:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
District 4 uh today I'm introducing HB
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
756 uh which is uh lead blood testing
 
05:05:52.830 --> 05:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
levels uh so lead poisoning among
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
children is rising dramatically across
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
our state uh the proposed legislation
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
mandates blood level uh blood Le level
 
05:06:03.150 --> 05:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
testing for children aged six or upon
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
entry into a public school or Child Care
 
05:06:10.350 --> 05:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
Agency uh which is critical Timely uh
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
and is actually a response to the
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
alarming data uh revealing a 43% surge
 
05:06:19.830 --> 05:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
in lead poisoning cases in 2023 with
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
1,142 children suffering harmful blood
 
05:06:25.708 --> 05:06:25.718 align:start position:0%
lead levels and lowincome Medicaid uh
 
05:06:28.350 --> 05:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
insured children twice as likely to be
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
poison this legislation is a moral and
 
05:06:33.510 --> 05:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
practical imperative to prot protect the
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
vulnerable youth lead poisoning causes
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
irreversible cognitive damage uh
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
impairing learning concentration and
 
05:06:44.628 --> 05:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
lifelong potential the recent Spike saw
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
342 more children poisoned in 2023 than
 
05:06:51.548 --> 05:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
the previous year signals a systemic
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
failure while increased testing post
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic explains some of the rise
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
experts have warned the true tool is
 
05:07:00.670 --> 05:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
likely higher this legislation closes
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
that Gap by requiring Universal testing
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring no child slips through these
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
cracks as you have heard in the previous
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
Bill low-income families bear the front
 
05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
of this crisis as older rental housing
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
often uh disrepair uh is Laden with lead
 
05:07:18.910 --> 05:07:18.920 align:start position:0%

05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid insured children mandatory
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
testing ensures early detection for all
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of income and empowers
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
parents with state provided educational
 
05:07:30.910 --> 05:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
resources to mitigate risks lead
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
poisoning costs taxpayers millions in
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
healthcare special education and loss
 
05:07:38.750 --> 05:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
productivity earlier detection is far
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
cheaper than treating lifelong
 
05:07:43.628 --> 05:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
disabilities and this legislation's
 
05:07:46.230 --> 05:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
testing mandate uh paired with
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions for religious exceptions
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%

individual rights while reducing
 
05:07:54.548 --> 05:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
long-term economic burdens New Hampshire
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
cannot ignore a crisis poisoning its
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
future generations with lead levels at
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
historic highs and vulnerable children
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
at the most risk this legislation is
 
05:08:08.110 --> 05:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
necessary evidence-based intervention it
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
priorites uh prevention and
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
accountability safeguarding Children's
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
Health while addressing the root causes
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
of exposure passing this bill is not
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
just policy but it is a moral duty to
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire's children and
 
05:08:23.670 --> 05:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
build a healthier Fair future for all
 
05:08:24.990 --> 05:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and I'm open to any
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
05:08:30.310 --> 05:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um just um was
 
05:08:34.750 --> 05:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
there a particular reason that you
 
05:08:37.548 --> 05:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
limited it to Public
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
Schools um I believe believe so this is
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
a resubmission of uh legislation that
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
was proposed last year uh and I mean I
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
do think that the public schools is the
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
best and easiest way to implement this
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
without necessarily uh trying to get
 
05:08:57.030 --> 05:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
involved with uh private
 
05:09:00.430 --> 05:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
entities follow up um but just in view
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
of fairness wouldn't it be applicable to
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
all schools I think that it could be
 
05:09:10.708 --> 05:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
well again follow comment perhaps to
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
clarify um say a child does go to a
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
private school and finds out he has
 
05:09:21.150 --> 05:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
difficulty because of lead
 
05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
poisoning currently they don't have the
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
ability to take a child with
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
IEPs and it's a cons that falls back to
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
the public schools so in that sense the
 
05:09:34.548 --> 05:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
private schools then would reap the
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
benefit of that service uh without any
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so therefore I would
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
say uh I would encourage you to consider
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
having it all schools yeah I may be uh
 
05:09:53.868 --> 05:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
also incorrect about this uh but I
 
05:09:57.230 --> 05:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
believe it also would allow any children
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh aged
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
six to potentially be able to be
 
05:10:04.270 --> 05:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
eligible for that again I'm sorry I'm I
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't have uh full text in front of me
 
05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
10 yes yeah yes I understand what you're
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying that would be for someone who had
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
been domiciled from birth if someone is
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
say coming from some other venue uh into
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
the state and it wants to enter directly
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
into the school system at that time they
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
would not have been included yeah oh I I
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to say
 
05:10:54.510 --> 05:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a good amendment to to add
 
05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
in to make sure that all students would
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
be eligible for
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none okay thank you
 
05:11:12.750 --> 05:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:14.190 --> 05:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
05:11:25.548 --> 05:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
do uh good afternoon members of the
 
05:11:30.750 --> 05:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm representative Alice weed
 
05:11:33.070 --> 05:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh representing do W 2 and straford
 
05:11:35.310 --> 05:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
district 15 and I'm one of the
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on this
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill so um the really the core part of
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
the spill it gets at is having data on
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning the the importance of
 
05:11:50.350 --> 05:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
that in terms of abatement cannot be
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
understated knowing whether or not a
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
child has had
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
exposure is just the very start of the
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
process um and it can help not only
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
improve that child's health it can
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being exposed in the
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
future if you catch it early um but it
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
can also Trends um in the area and can
 
05:12:15.070 --> 05:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
prent prevent additional exposure to
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
many more
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
people let's say if one child tests
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
positive you can test their home and
 
05:12:25.830 --> 05:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you find contaminants um on the
 
05:12:28.868 --> 05:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
window sill or on the door frames from
 
05:12:31.750 --> 05:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
when it rubs you can treat that um if
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
you don't find contaminants the
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
investigators can go through further
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
processes to identify um exposure
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
through food products like was mentioned
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
during the last hearing and that can
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
help um identify those issues and then
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
prevent thousands more children from
 
05:12:52.990 --> 05:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
being exposed to that
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
contamination you know it can it can
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
help that child it can help any child
 
05:13:00.270 --> 05:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
that moves into that house in the future
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
um if another child if their friend
 
05:13:04.030 --> 05:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
visits their house it can prevent them
 
05:13:07.150 --> 05:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
from exposure maybe it's in the soil and
 
05:13:10.590 --> 05:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
it can help their neighbors too
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know the same goes for things like
 
05:13:16.470 --> 05:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
daycares um and those Trends can only be
 
05:13:20.270 --> 05:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
identified when you have sufficient data
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know lead back in the 1900s was
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere um in our paint and our
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
gasoline and we did a lot of great work
 
05:13:31.030 --> 05:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent that but a lot of those older
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
buildings as is the case here in New
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire still have a lot of lead paint
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
in them Flakes and
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
all of that and this problem doesn't go
 
05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
away on its own lead doesn't degrade on
 
05:13:50.030 --> 05:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
its own um without actively working to
 
05:13:50.040 --> 05:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
its own um without actively working to
address

05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
it you know just this week it's been
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned nhpr released um the the
 
05:13:59.948 --> 05:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
headline with the report about how lead
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
poisoning is the highest they've ever
 
05:14:03.628 --> 05:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
been since we started
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
testing and that's likely a significant
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
undercount because testing is not
 
05:14:09.120 --> 05:14:10.390 align:start position:0%
undercount because testing is not
currently

05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:14:13.868 --> 05:14:13.878 align:start position:0%
Universal that exposure has drastic
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
effects on the health of children it
 
05:14:17.470 --> 05:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
impedes their brain development and
 
05:14:19.150 --> 05:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
causes a number of additional health
 
05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
issues you know there have been a lot of
 
05:14:23.430 --> 05:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
studies that correlate lead exposure to
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
higher rates of crime lower IQ uh other
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
health defects like damage to their
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
brain their nervous system you know
 
05:14:32.430 --> 05:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
challenges with with hearing and
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
speaking processing and many learning
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
disorders um you know and treating this
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
lead exposure has a high return on
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
investment yielding at least $17 for
 
05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
every $1 you spend on
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
it and that's why this bill is in
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's best interest since you can
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
only treat lead if you know it's a
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
problem in the first place and I
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to vote on to pass on
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
this bill uh thank you and I'm happy to
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you any
 
05:15:08.830 --> 05:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:15:08.840 --> 05:15:13.788 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nancy Murphy from hills
 
05:15:26.990 --> 05:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.548 --> 05:15:29.558 align:start position:0%
is good afternoon Mr chair and honorable
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Nancy
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy uh representing Hillsboro 12 the
 
05:15:35.030 --> 05:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
town of
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
March um I'm here um as a co-sponsor and
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
to expr my support for HB
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
756 um HB 766 756 is both a public
 
05:15:49.390 --> 05:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
health and Child Protection bill it's
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
important to remember that there is no
 
05:15:54.430 --> 05:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
safe level for lead in a child's body
 
05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
lead is a neurotoxin which causes
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
neurodevelopmental disabilities in
 
05:16:00.990 --> 05:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
children resulting in learning and
 
05:16:03.708 --> 05:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
behavioral challenges that can be
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
lifelong increased cost for special
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
education services result in higher
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
property tax for New Hampshire citizens
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
though the analysis notes that this bill
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
establishes a blood testing requirement
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
for children entering daycare in public
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
schools we should be clear that the
 
05:16:21.310 --> 05:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
requirement is not actually for the
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
testing itself as that is already in
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
current RSA following a study Commission
 
05:16:29.110 --> 05:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
on lead poisoning that led to SB 147
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
being passed into law in
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
2018 HB 756 does not add any new
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for physical examination
 
05:16:39.788 --> 05:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
nor lab testing for lead rather the
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
requirement referenced in the bill
 
05:16:44.030 --> 05:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
analysis pertains to a notation on the
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
school daycare Health form of a single
 
05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
Le testing result which would not be
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
necessary If the child is Exempted
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
should the child's health form be
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
missing that single blood level testing
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
result that New Hampshire statute
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
already requires the school or daycare
 
05:17:04.590 --> 05:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
will a remind the parent guardian of the
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
lead testing requirement and B provide
 
05:17:09.548 --> 05:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
them New Hampshire DHHS supplied
 
05:17:09.558 --> 05:17:10.788 align:start position:0%
them New Hampshire DHHS supplied
educational

05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
educational
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
materials uh relative to lead poisoning
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
and the importance of lead testing it's
 
05:17:19.548 --> 05:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
hope that HB 756 will lead to increased
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
compliance with lead level testing so
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
that parents of children found to have
 
05:17:26.830 --> 05:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
elevated lead levels can have a better
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of risks relative to lead
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
toxicity and the options for
 
05:17:33.868 --> 05:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
treatment this will afford parents the
 
05:17:36.110 --> 05:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to intervene quickly and
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
protect the health and well-being of
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
their children thank you for your time
 
05:17:41.470 --> 05:17:41.480 align:start position:0%

05:18:10.990 --> 05:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
Services as is someone with you also um
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
she she is speaking separately okay good
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
afternoon again my name is Katie Hatcher
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
um at the NASA division of Public Health
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
I have been a registered nurse for 15
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
years and I have been working as a
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
public health nurse doing lead poisoning
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
prevention directly with families for
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
six years thank you for allowing me to
 
05:18:31.470 --> 05:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
speak um all New Hampshire children
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
deserve the freedom to reach their full
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
potential and lead poisoning robs our
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
children of that freedom lead is a
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
neurot talk
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
and children under the age of 6 years
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
old do not have a fully formed bloodb
 
05:18:45.788 --> 05:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
brain barrier to protect themselves from
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
that poison there is no safe level of
 
05:18:50.910 --> 05:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
lead in a child's body the human body
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
does not know what to do with lead when
 
05:18:54.990 --> 05:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
it enters the body so your body actually
 
05:18:58.110 --> 05:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
think it's calcium lead follows the path
 
05:18:59.788 --> 05:18:59.798 align:start position:0%
that calcium takes throughout the body
 
05:19:02.190 --> 05:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
so it goes directly to the brain your
 
05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
blood soft tissues and your
 
05:19:08.430 --> 05:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
bones the research shows that even very
 
05:19:11.670 --> 05:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
low levels of lead causes irreversible
 
05:19:14.430 --> 05:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
cognitive deficits developmental delays
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
lower IQ speech delays the need for
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
special education services in school and
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
there is even correlation that childhood
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning can cause incarceration
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
as adults because lead can affect the
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
impulse decision-making part of your
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
brain we have to stop the cycle of
 
05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
generational lead poisoning which
 
05:19:38.830 --> 05:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
perpetuates the cycle of poverty when a
 
05:19:42.430 --> 05:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
child is poisoned 95% of the lead burden
 
05:19:44.190 --> 05:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
goes directly to their bones and it
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
stays there for decades upon decades
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
even if that child is removed from all
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
environmental lead hazards their own
 
05:19:55.470 --> 05:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
bones become the exposure Source I'm
 
05:19:56.830 --> 05:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
going to repeat that because I think
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's really important when a child is
 
05:20:02.670 --> 05:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
poisoned 95% of the lead burden goes
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
directly to their bones and it stays
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
there for decades upon decades even if
 
05:20:10.350 --> 05:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
the the child is removed from all
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
environmental lead hazards their bones
 
05:20:15.868 --> 05:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
will become the exposure source for
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
example a female child who is lead
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
poisoned reaches childbearing age she
 
05:20:23.150 --> 05:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
becomes pregnant during the second
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
trimester of her pregnancy her fetus
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
tries to pull calcium from her mother's
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
bones to make bones for the fetus when
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
there is lead in the bones lead gets
 
05:20:36.030 --> 05:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
pulled instead of calcium so that fetus
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
becomes lead
 
05:20:39.948 --> 05:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
poisoned another another example is when
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
a child is lead poisoned the lead stays
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
in their bones they become elderly if
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
they develop
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
osteoporosis that lead is leeched back
 
05:20:50.830 --> 05:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
into their blood and they're lead
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
poisoned again when they're when they're
 
05:20:56.510 --> 05:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
age childhood lead poisoning is 100 100%
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
preventable it is irreversible it causes
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
lifelong def deficits for the child the
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
family the community and and our economy
 
05:21:12.910 --> 05:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
we have the power today right now to
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
make a difference for the children of
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I ask you to please
 
05:21:20.190 --> 05:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you prect
 
05:21:23.708 --> 05:21:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions see no questions thank you for
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Molly
 
05:21:46.350 --> 05:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to the chair and the
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee again and thank you that was
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
that was wonderful and said a lot of
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say so I'll be very
 
05:21:55.708 --> 05:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
very brief my name is Molly Ellis I'm a
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
resident of keen New
 
05:22:00.190 --> 05:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm here again to ask you
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
to support House Bill
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
756 uh when I discovered that my son's
 
05:22:07.708 --> 05:22:07.718 align:start position:0%
blood lead level was elevated a few
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
years ago I really really
 
05:22:13.390 --> 05:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
panicked um because doctors have
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
discovered that there is no safe blood
 
05:22:18.830 --> 05:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
level in the blood um it is especially
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
crucial to test very young children
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
because as we as we just heard um they
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
have no blood brain barrier and the lead
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
is absorbed into their brains which
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
um which causes so many so many terrible
 
05:22:41.230 --> 05:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
problems um It's associated with um
 
05:22:43.948 --> 05:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
behavioral problems uh cognitive
 
05:22:46.628 --> 05:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
impairment um stunted growth hearing
 
05:22:48.990 --> 05:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
problems even
 
05:22:52.270 --> 05:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration um because we learned
 
05:22:55.708 --> 05:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
about my son's elevated lead level his
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
his Outlook is very good and uh this
 
05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
bill can help keep other children's
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
future safe as well so please vote in
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
favor of of House Bill 756 thank you for
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration and I will
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions if anybody has any
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
05:23:22.830 --> 05:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Jackie
 
05:23:33.628 --> 05:23:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is it Jackie or is it Jack
 
05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
clay or Jackie well it's Jack Jacqueline
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
oh okay when I was in trouble with my
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
parents but I'm Jackie okay um how do
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
you do chairman McDonald and members of
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jackie Cowell I
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
am the executive director of early
 
05:23:52.030 --> 05:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
learning New Hampshire we are a
 
05:23:54.750 --> 05:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit and our mission is
 
05:23:56.230 --> 05:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all New Hampshire
 
05:23:58.030 --> 05:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
children have the opportunity to reach
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
their full potential um we do that
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
through supporting Child Care programs
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
as well as the families they serve and
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
so we are actually um coming in
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to this build not because of
 
05:24:11.190 --> 05:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
its intent but simply because of its
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
solution we feel there is a more logical
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
and efficient solution than what is
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill um knowing again
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a requirement to have
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
blood Le level testing um we do not
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
oppose at all having a an extra line on
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
the health form that goes to the public
 
05:24:31.628 --> 05:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
schools or for child care
 
05:24:34.750 --> 05:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
agencies um but having the burden and
 
05:24:37.868 --> 05:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
the duty of it not being completed going
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
back to the child care provider and then
 
05:24:42.150 --> 05:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
alerting the parent and trying to give
 
05:24:44.830 --> 05:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
the parent documents why it seems so
 
05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
much more efficient that the healthc
 
05:24:49.230 --> 05:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
care provider fill it out it or if they
 
05:24:50.910 --> 05:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the information they have the
 
05:24:54.030 --> 05:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
capacity to do that testing there it
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
does not make sense to us adding this
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
extra paperwork and documentation for
 
05:25:02.990 --> 05:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
something that could we believe be much
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
better fulfilled if it was the health
 
05:25:07.230 --> 05:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
care provider who was required to fill
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
that out
 
05:25:09.520 --> 05:25:10.350 align:start position:0%
that out
thank

05:25:10.350 --> 05:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no
 
05:25:20.670 --> 05:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
lonte hi thank you
 
05:25:27.390 --> 05:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
um though I think the point of the bill
 
05:25:30.190 --> 05:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
is to be able to identify
 
05:25:34.270 --> 05:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
children uh that enroll in a daycare
 
05:25:38.590 --> 05:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
that perhaps never um were tested it's
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
just just a feel safe right I do
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
understand that but the first order of
 
05:25:46.590 --> 05:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is a healthcare
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
provider will fill out the
 
05:25:50.910 --> 05:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
form there has that has to happen before
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
they enter that they have that Health
 
05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
form filled out so if there's a new line
 
05:25:57.948 --> 05:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
there that the provide that the child
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
care provider would be reading so would
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
the health care provider and if there's
 
05:26:03.150 --> 05:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's blank and there's no testing it
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
seems more logical to us that the
 
05:26:09.628 --> 05:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider then take action
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay does that make
 
05:26:11.280 --> 05:26:14.110 align:start position:0%
okay does that make
sense

05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah representative kofalt and then
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:26:19.708 --> 05:26:19.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
question so current statute does require
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
Leed testing for children between one
 
05:26:28.670 --> 05:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
and two I believe if I understand
 
05:26:33.470 --> 05:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
correctly and so um it seems to me that
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would cover two scenarios one
 
05:26:39.548 --> 05:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
is children who were exposed at some
 
05:26:41.948 --> 05:26:41.958 align:start position:0%
point after they were initially tested
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
by a physician and the other would be
 
05:26:46.750 --> 05:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
children who moved to New Hampshire you
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
know whose families moved to New
 
05:26:50.350 --> 05:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from out of state um it seems
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
to me that that sort of uh gives us a a
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
much smaller subset not I mean obviously
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
every child is important we want those
 
05:27:02.430 --> 05:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
children to be safe and and healthy but
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
um can you comment on sort of what do
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
you think the impact is in terms of sort
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the procedural concerns that you
 
05:27:11.548 --> 05:27:11.558 align:start position:0%
brought up and the fact that we are
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
already requiring lead testing for
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
children um before the age of two yeah
 
05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
and again I I applaud the intent of of
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill and I um feel
 
05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
that it's a good idea to have that new
 
05:27:29.430 --> 05:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
part on the form that's not there now
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
saying what the blood Le level to is and
 
05:27:35.788 --> 05:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
again because the first contact with
 
05:27:37.868 --> 05:27:37.878 align:start position:0%
that form is not the childcare provider
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's the health care provider that if
 
05:27:41.708 --> 05:27:41.718 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
there um that's where it's best caught
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
and and resolved when they when they're
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
filling that form out whether they're
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to a childcare program or a public
 
05:27:56.190 --> 05:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
school representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
05:27:59.948 --> 05:27:59.958 align:start position:0%
think I have two questions the first is
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
what happens to that form ah yeah so it
 
05:28:06.670 --> 05:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
is filed and uh data is kept on
 
05:28:08.670 --> 05:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations um there is an annual
 
05:28:11.070 --> 05:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
report that is required by childcare
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
programs um this again part of what I'm
 
05:28:17.948 --> 05:28:17.958 align:start position:0%
thinking about is if this form comes
 
05:28:21.190 --> 05:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
incomplete um then this bill then asks
 
05:28:22.948 --> 05:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
the child care provider rather than
 
05:28:26.230 --> 05:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
asking the form to be complete ask the
 
05:28:28.590 --> 05:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
childcare provider to notice that
 
05:28:30.990 --> 05:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
document you know U go back to the
 
05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
parent tell them give them forms you
 
05:28:35.270 --> 05:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
know tell them that they have to have it
 
05:28:38.310 --> 05:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
completed Etc that seems a lot less
 
05:28:41.788 --> 05:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
efficient and may not result in a quick
 
05:28:41.798 --> 05:28:43.350 align:start position:0%
efficient and may not result in a quick
solution

05:28:43.350 --> 05:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
solution
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
um this really more of a second question
 
05:28:47.628 --> 05:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
a follow up and I apologize if you're
 
05:28:49.590 --> 05:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
not the right person to answer this but
 
05:28:51.548 --> 05:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
all the form requires is that at some
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
point between the age of one and six
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
you've had a blood test which by law has
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be between one and two which means
 
05:28:59.788 --> 05:28:59.798 align:start position:0%
there's a big gap between two and six
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
right and I'm I'm not the best person to
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
answer that all I know is that this bill
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
talks about it being that if it's blank
 
05:29:09.390 --> 05:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
that the childcare or the public school
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
then connects to the parent and does
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
some documentation of disseminating
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
information Etc yeah thanks
 
05:29:19.230 --> 05:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
representative Woods uh thank you Mr
 
05:29:22.510 --> 05:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
chair and you again may or may may or
 
05:29:24.670 --> 05:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
may not be able to answer the question
 
05:29:28.150 --> 05:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh we we talked about all kids by law
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
have to be tested from up to Age Two uh
 
05:29:35.628 --> 05:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
but um what is the actual compliance
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
with that uh sitting on a commission
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
couple years ago we found the compliance
 
05:29:46.830 --> 05:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
was really poor so when we read this do
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
we know what the current compliance is
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
for I don't know yeah that's that's not
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
my expertise again um it's that whether
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
they fill it in whether they have if the
 
05:29:58.670 --> 05:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider has the blood Le
 
05:29:58.680 --> 05:30:03.628 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider has the blood Le
level

05:30:03.628 --> 05:30:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:10.270 --> 05:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none okay thank you sure
 
05:30:10.280 --> 05:30:12.708 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none okay thank you sure
thank

05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Kim
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
Bernard from Nash Department of Public
 
05:30:17.680 --> 05:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
Bernard from Nash Department of Public
Health

05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.788 --> 05:30:29.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:33.788 --> 05:30:33.798 align:start position:0%
again okay so my name is Kim Bernard um
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
I've been a registered nurse for 30 plus
 
05:30:38.910 --> 05:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
years I currently am the chief public
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
health nurse at the nashwa division of
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
Public Health and Community
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
Services children have that have led
 
05:30:48.070 --> 05:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
poisoning typically look happy and
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
healthy as the cognitive and behavioral
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
deficits often times do not show
 
05:30:55.868 --> 05:30:55.878 align:start position:0%
themselves until school age the only way
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
to know if a child is Led poisoned is to
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
test them Universal testing has been a
 
05:31:04.270 --> 05:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
great start to increasing testing rates
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire however according to
 
05:31:11.788 --> 05:31:11.798 align:start position:0%
recently published 2023 data brief 24%
 
05:31:14.150 --> 05:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
of one-year-olds are not being tested
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
and 31% of 2-year-olds are not being
 
05:31:18.990 --> 05:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
tested that's a lot of children in New
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are slipping through the
 
05:31:24.990 --> 05:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
cracks we know that lead poisoning
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affects lowincome
 
05:31:29.948 --> 05:31:29.958 align:start position:0%
populations New Hampshire children on
 
05:31:32.350 --> 05:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as was discussed during the
 
05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
last bill are twice as likely to have
 
05:31:37.948 --> 05:31:37.958 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning research shows that many
 
05:31:39.548 --> 05:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
children who have lead poisoning
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
required special education services to
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
access their
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
educations there are new studies that
 
05:31:47.070 --> 05:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
have just been published correlating
 
05:31:49.070 --> 05:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
childhood lead poisoning with mental
 
05:31:51.830 --> 05:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
health um with mental illness as
 
05:31:54.270 --> 05:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
adults part of the job that we do in
 
05:31:56.670 --> 05:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
public health is provide nurse case
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
management to children who are LED
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
poisoned as well as their families we go
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
into their homes we work with these
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
families over months sometimes
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
years because it takes a very long time
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
to get lead out of a child's body even
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
when the lead hazards are
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
removed we connect with these families
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
we connect these families with Community
 
05:32:20.510 --> 05:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
Resources such as early supports which
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
includes early intervention for one to
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
threey olds with things such as OT
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy speech therapy
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
physical therapy because we know these
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
children are at high resk risk for de
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
developmental and behavioral
 
05:32:36.750 --> 05:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
deficits we also connect these families
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
to Wick because Healthy nutrition as my
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
colleague had mentioned is one of the
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
tools that we use to help um with lead
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
poisoning because often times it can
 
05:32:48.000 --> 05:32:49.150 align:start position:0%
poisoning because often times it can
cause

05:32:49.150 --> 05:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
cause
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
anemia these families feel like their
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
lives have been turned upside down that
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
their home is not safe that their child
 
05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
may not be able to have the future they
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
envisioned for them we have seen
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
children as not as young as 9 months
 
05:33:05.788 --> 05:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
test positive for lead from home
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
renovations we are seeing an increas in
 
05:33:10.590 --> 05:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
of five and sixy olds having lead
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
poisoning due to lead in food such as
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%

resource to the committee and try to
 
05:34:30.430 --> 05:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
provide some information that we heard
 
05:34:32.670 --> 05:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
from some questions I think it was
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
specifically uh representative Wood's
 
05:34:37.948 --> 05:34:37.958 align:start position:0%
question related to testing rates for
 
05:34:39.868 --> 05:34:39.878 align:start position:0%
one and 2 year olds there is a
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
requirement in RSA
 
05:34:45.510 --> 05:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
13A colon
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
a-5a uh which uh New Hampshire is a
 
05:34:51.788 --> 05:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
universal testing uh State and there's a
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for all one and two year
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
olds uh to be tested for lead um and we
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
have that data available there is an
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
exception in the law as well um there we
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
do have that data and you all should re
 
05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
have received a copy of the 2023 Le data
 
05:35:14.430 --> 05:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
brief and so on the first page um you'll
 
05:35:17.708 --> 05:35:17.718 align:start position:0%
see um at the bottom of the first page
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a graph and maybe Beverly you
 
05:35:21.948 --> 05:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
can speak to it a little bit more but
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a graph that shows the testing
 
05:35:26.510 --> 05:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
rates for all one and two year olds in
 
05:35:29.190 --> 05:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so in New Hampshire right
 
05:35:29.200 --> 05:35:30.708 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so in New Hampshire right
now

05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
sorry in New Hampshire right now if you
 
05:35:34.628 --> 05:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
look at the bottom uh graph here it
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
shows at 2023 that 76% of our one-year
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
olds were tested for blood Le levels and
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
69% of our 2-year olds the universal
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
testing law in the state of New
 
05:35:48.030 --> 05:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that was implemented in 2018
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
requires our one-year-olds to be tested
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
and again our two-year-olds so it's two
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
tests a one-year-old and a 2-year-old
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
and if a a child for whatever reason
 
05:36:00.910 --> 05:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
misses their Well wellcheck Visit and
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
misses that one or twoyear old test and
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
they go back to the doctor at their 3
 
05:36:08.430 --> 05:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
four 5year old if they're under 6 years
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
old we recommend that they have their
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
blood Le levels tested so test at one
 
05:36:16.590 --> 05:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
test it two and if you miss one of those
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
tests you they they call it catch-up
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
or5 so I just wanted to make sure the
 
05:36:27.430 --> 05:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee understood New Hampshire's
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
Universal testing law okay any questions
 
05:36:30.878 --> 05:36:32.990 align:start position:0%
Universal testing law okay any questions
representative

05:36:32.990 --> 05:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:35.708 --> 05:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
Nel thanks Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
05:36:37.750 --> 05:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
my question I'm just always curious when
 
05:36:39.390 --> 05:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
we have laws like that what are the
 
05:36:41.548 --> 05:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
ramifications for parents if they don't
 
05:36:41.558 --> 05:36:42.948 align:start position:0%
ramifications for parents if they don't
do

05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:36:46.830 --> 05:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
it so there is an exception in law and
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
assuming no exception assum what is the
 
05:36:52.990 --> 05:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
ramification if a parent chooses not to
 
05:36:54.868 --> 05:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
test child just doesn't do it is non
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
compliant doesn't do it I I would think
 
05:36:59.150 --> 05:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
the ramifications might be that you
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
would get your child into into school
 
05:37:04.510 --> 05:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
and the school district might not have a
 
05:37:06.590 --> 05:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
flag that this child had a bloodle
 
05:37:09.070 --> 05:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
elevation which is a a brain injury and
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
they might not be looking for they might
 
05:37:14.270 --> 05:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
not get him enrolled in an IEP they
 
05:37:16.070 --> 05:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
might not be able to start those
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
Services soon enough yeah the reason I'm
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
asking the question is laws are only as
 
05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
good as they are enforceable and if
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
there's no enforce ability behind this
 
05:37:27.470 --> 05:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect our ability to do
 
05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
this I I think it you know it's the it's
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
the relationship with the between the
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
pro medical provider and and the parent
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
and that the recommendation that come
 
05:37:41.390 --> 05:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
through for that and this law allow you
 
05:37:44.750 --> 05:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
know just provides that guidance back to
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
clinicians to to do that t that early on
 
05:37:51.708 --> 05:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
testing the recommended
 
05:37:53.708 --> 05:37:53.718 align:start position:0%
guidance representative Woods did you
 
05:37:56.670 --> 05:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
have your hand up a moment
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
ago are you one more question I mean I
 
05:38:01.270 --> 05:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
was looking up the cdc's guidelines and
 
05:38:03.190 --> 05:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
they actually recommend testing at six
 
05:38:05.310 --> 05:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
years too are we ever looking at doing
 
05:38:07.708 --> 05:38:07.718 align:start position:0%
that as well so right now our test in
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
laws 72 months and younger which is the
 
05:38:14.190 --> 05:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
month that a child turns six so uh we
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
educate our providers and the the
 
05:38:17.670 --> 05:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Academy of Pediatrics in their
 
05:38:20.190 --> 05:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
Bright Futures guidelines recommends
 
05:38:23.948 --> 05:38:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:26.708 --> 05:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
old representative Woods yeah thank you
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
I just uh I need need to help me through
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
your data yeah uh on the
 
05:38:36.430 --> 05:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
one-year-olds um uh we'll just say for
 
05:38:36.440 --> 05:38:38.070 align:start position:0%
one-year-olds um uh we'll just say for
2369

05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
2369
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
% uh and then on the same year
 
05:38:45.150 --> 05:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
that so those are okay I think I
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
understand that in other words when the
 
05:38:50.350 --> 05:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
one-year-olds were tested when when
 
05:38:52.030 --> 05:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
they're two-year-olds they wouldn't be
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
tested because they were tested when
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're oneyear old no let me help
 
05:38:57.670 --> 05:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit Yeah so on the
 
05:38:59.310 --> 05:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
graph on the bottom of the first page
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
the blue line is the testing rates for
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
our one-year olds so if you look at 2022
 
05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
you can see that 77% of our one-year
 
05:39:09.390 --> 05:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
olds were tested and it went down
 
05:39:12.910 --> 05:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
slightly in 23 only 76% of our
 
05:39:15.070 --> 05:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
one-year-olds were tested but we had
 
05:39:17.070 --> 05:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
some huge gains with our 2-year-olds so
 
05:39:20.230 --> 05:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at 2022 the Orange Line you
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
can see in 2022 57% of our 2-year olds
 
05:39:26.830 --> 05:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
were tested and it improved to 69% in
 
05:39:30.110 --> 05:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
2023 so the law requires a one-year-old
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
get tested and then because that's when
 
05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
they start they're mobile right we want
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
to test them early and then we test them
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
again at their second birthday two tests
 
05:39:42.510 --> 05:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's why I wanted to clarify it's
 
05:39:45.510 --> 05:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
two tests two test it's not just age
 
05:39:47.948 --> 05:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
correct no it's two tests and that
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
citation is in RSA
 
05:39:55.350 --> 05:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
130-a colon 5A so that's the y That's
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
the universal testing law requirement
 
05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I hear
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
request ired
 
05:40:08.798 --> 05:40:11.150 align:start position:0%
request ired
suggested

05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
05:40:14.590 --> 05:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh is there is it is it required is it
 
05:40:18.468 --> 05:40:18.478 align:start position:0%
is it a a bylaw required of parents and
 
05:40:20.910 --> 05:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
if they do miss having their children
 
05:40:25.030 --> 05:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
tested are they legally liable to be
 
05:40:27.390 --> 05:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
fined or taken to court or is there any
 
05:40:30.510 --> 05:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
te teeth to that so I'm looking at RSA
 
05:40:34.590 --> 05:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
130a semicolon 5A which is our Universal
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
section of the blood of the state Le law
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it says all health care providers
 
05:40:42.468 --> 05:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
who provide Primary Medical Care shall
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
conduct blood Le testing of all one and
 
05:40:46.990 --> 05:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
twoyear old patients to determine their
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
blood Le level a health care provider
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
shall not be liable for not performing a
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
test for blood Le level when a parent or
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
a guardian has been informed of the
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
blood Le testing requirement has refused
 
05:41:01.750 --> 05:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
to consent or fail to follow through in
 
05:41:04.430 --> 05:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
response to a referral for a test
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in the section shall prevent a
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider from RE
 
05:41:08.670 --> 05:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
recommending blood Le testing for
 
05:41:11.070 --> 05:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
children younger than one or older than
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
two should circumstance including
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
potential lead exposure hazards warrant
 
05:41:16.320 --> 05:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
potential lead exposure hazards warrant
such

05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:41:17.440 --> 05:41:19.350 align:start position:0%
such
testing

05:41:19.350 --> 05:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
testing
 
05:41:24.070 --> 05:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:26.548 --> 05:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
mcgrail is
 
05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
the percentage of untested do you
 
05:41:35.548 --> 05:41:35.558 align:start position:0%
believe the barrier is those are
 
05:41:35.558 --> 05:41:39.310 align:start position:0%
believe the barrier is those are
uninsured

05:41:39.310 --> 05:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I can speak to that I
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't have that data I I think we know
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
that some families don't have a medical
 
05:41:49.990 --> 05:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
home um I think we have a little bit of
 
05:41:51.868 --> 05:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
ways to go with educating our health
 
05:41:54.190 --> 05:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
care providers that it's two
 
05:41:56.868 --> 05:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
tests right so I think it's a
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
factors other
 
05:42:06.070 --> 05:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you thank
 
05:42:06.080 --> 05:42:13.868 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you thank
you

05:42:13.868 --> 05:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Melissa
 
05:42:16.948 --> 05:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
Clement from the Department of Health
 
05:42:26.830 --> 05:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:29.070 --> 05:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
unit thank you members of the committee
 
05:42:30.468 --> 05:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Melissa

Clement and I'm the chief of the
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
childcare licensing unit in the
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to answer any questions
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
may have regarding um the section that
 
05:42:42.510 --> 05:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
speaks to the health forms in child care
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
programs um because we would be the one
 
05:42:46.948 --> 05:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
enforcing that action so if you have any
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to answer them are
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative Nagel
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
question I I if I remember last year
 
05:42:59.548 --> 05:42:59.558 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of opposition on the
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
basis of time elements and things like
 
05:43:03.390 --> 05:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
that it seems to me this is just a
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
simple check mark that then gets um
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
transferred ref to somebody else to
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
review is that accurate sure um let me
 
05:43:13.948 --> 05:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question um the
 
05:43:15.990 --> 05:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
what the process that would happen is a
 
05:43:18.270 --> 05:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
childcare program would receive the form
 
05:43:20.310 --> 05:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
they would be reviewing to see if the
 
05:43:22.708 --> 05:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
lead level was there if the lead level
 
05:43:25.310 --> 05:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
isn't there according to the bill um the
 
05:43:27.110 --> 05:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
program would then be required to go
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
back to the parent and provide resources
 
05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
or determine if they have refused the
 
05:43:33.548 --> 05:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
test so what we would be doing when we
 
05:43:36.270 --> 05:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
go into the program we take a sample of
 
05:43:38.270 --> 05:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
children's record where we we already
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
have a health form um it does have a
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
spot for a blood level test but we would
 
05:43:43.280 --> 05:43:44.270 align:start position:0%
spot for a blood level test but we would
now

05:43:44.270 --> 05:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
spe excuse me specifically be looking to
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
see that that section was completed and
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
then if it wasn't we would have
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions for the provider to
 
05:43:56.990 --> 05:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
for them to show us what documentation
 
05:43:59.708 --> 05:43:59.718 align:start position:0%
they had regarding um what they provided
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
to the parent so that would be the
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
process and then if they didn't have
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
that information they would be cited for
 
05:44:07.390 --> 05:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
non-compliance because it was not there
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
and they didn't or they did not provide
 
05:44:11.468 --> 05:44:11.478 align:start position:0%
the information to the parents as
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
required other
 
05:44:17.310 --> 05:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
05:44:20.310 --> 05:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.948 --> 05:44:22.958 align:start position:0%

05:44:26.468 --> 05:44:26.478 align:start position:0%

leontine okay representative Lamonte in
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
seconds um representative kofalt do you
 
06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion yes I think
 
06:05:52.150 --> 06:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh this bill address addresses three
 
06:05:54.510 --> 06:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
issues one is access uh there are people
 
06:05:57.548 --> 06:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
who live uh pretty far away from an ATC
 
06:06:01.510 --> 06:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
or dispensary and uh it it's a burden
 
06:06:04.590 --> 06:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
for them to uh to drive long distances
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
to to get medical
 
06:06:09.468 --> 06:06:09.478 align:start position:0%
cannabis um I also see a uh potential
 
06:06:12.830 --> 06:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
cost issue um a lot of these folks um
 
06:06:15.468 --> 06:06:15.478 align:start position:0%
are operating on a very uh thin budget
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
prices are high at atc's in New
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh allowing them to
 
06:06:22.350 --> 06:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
cultivate their own cannabis is uh is
 
06:06:24.430 --> 06:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
going to save them money and there's
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
also a safety issue which is that um you
 
06:06:29.830 --> 06:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
know I have heard that there are medical
 
06:06:33.030 --> 06:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients who who uh for for
 
06:06:36.510 --> 06:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
cost and access reasons um
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
may buy Black Market cannabis off the
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
street which could bring with it some
 
06:06:45.150 --> 06:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
potential U safety issues so uh for all
 
06:06:48.110 --> 06:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
of those reasons I I support House Bill
 
06:06:50.750 --> 06:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
53 thank you representative
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
delus so can you put your speak on your
 
06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
mic thanks for taking the question so
 
06:07:01.230 --> 06:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
the question is how who is checking on
 
06:07:03.150 --> 06:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
all this growth stuff I've asked that
 
06:07:04.750 --> 06:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
was the question I had asked before and
 
06:07:06.430 --> 06:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
I just I
 
06:07:07.708 --> 06:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there are enough checks
 
06:07:10.948 --> 06:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
and balances to this system as far as
 
06:07:10.958 --> 06:07:14.830 align:start position:0%
and balances to this system as far as
being

06:07:14.830 --> 06:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.150 --> 06:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
homegrown so um the same person who
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
checks all of our homes for illegal
 
06:07:23.110 --> 06:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis which is no one unless there's
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
some reason for them to be in the home
 
06:07:28.750 --> 06:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
so I you know I I I guess I see this as
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
saying there is uh permission is granted
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
and you will not be without outside the
 
06:07:36.468 --> 06:07:36.478 align:start position:0%
bounds of the law if you cultivate a
 
06:07:38.190 --> 06:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
certain amount of cannabis for your own
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
use or if a caregiver does so
 
06:07:45.510 --> 06:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
um that does not call for or require
 
06:07:47.468 --> 06:07:47.478 align:start position:0%
inspections in my mind it's simply
 
06:07:50.590 --> 06:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
saying um this this certain Behavior
 
06:07:53.468 --> 06:07:53.478 align:start position:0%
will not be deemed illegal under these
 
06:07:55.030 --> 06:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances so I don't think it calls
 
06:08:00.430 --> 06:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:02.590 --> 06:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
kind representative woods and then
 
06:08:07.150 --> 06:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nel um thank you uh in a
 
06:08:09.948 --> 06:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
general concept I'm I'm in in favor of
 
06:08:11.590 --> 06:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
the bill however for some of the reasons
 
06:08:14.270 --> 06:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
that were just stated I have some
 
06:08:18.868 --> 06:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
concerns um the um atcs have
 
06:08:22.590 --> 06:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily tight strict regular
 
06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
oversight about exactly not just growing
 
06:08:31.868 --> 06:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
it but how much what kind uh Etc
 
06:08:34.110 --> 06:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily tight
 
06:08:37.150 --> 06:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
oversight um putting this in an
 
06:08:37.160 --> 06:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
oversight um putting this in an
individual's

06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
individual's
 
06:08:42.270 --> 06:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
home uh um I think with no oversights
 
06:08:43.468 --> 06:08:43.478 align:start position:0%
that I can
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
see um other than someone's quotes
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
suspicion um raises some
 
06:08:55.628 --> 06:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
concerns uh and I say that from
 
06:08:59.310 --> 06:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
some background my neighbor a year a few
 
06:09:04.110 --> 06:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
years ago uh was a federal Ag and dealt
 
06:09:07.110 --> 06:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
with this issue and at that time uh one
 
06:09:10.910 --> 06:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the major problems uh was growing in
 
06:09:10.920 --> 06:09:12.110 align:start position:0%
of the major problems uh was growing in
individual

06:09:12.110 --> 06:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
individual
 
06:09:15.830 --> 06:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
homes uh in rural areas and and people
 
06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
were coming to New Hampshire for that
 
06:09:22.788 --> 06:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
purpose because rural areas have very
 
06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
poor police
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
coverage and therefore they thought that
 
06:09:30.590 --> 06:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
we'll buy a house and we'll just grow as
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
much as we can here and the basement and
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
everything else is just full of of drugs
 
06:09:40.948 --> 06:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
of all kinds um so
 
06:09:44.910 --> 06:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
I with virtually no oversight I think it
 
06:09:49.548 --> 06:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
does big to say well now I can really I
 
06:09:53.590 --> 06:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
can can go dark or someone's coming into
 
06:09:56.270 --> 06:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
your knocking on that individual's door
 
06:09:58.468 --> 06:09:58.478 align:start position:0%
and say oh you're growing your own look
 
06:10:01.548 --> 06:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
um I can make this very profitable for
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
you I'll help you do this if we can use
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
your basement
 
06:10:10.510 --> 06:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.150 --> 06:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
concerns other questions other comments
 
06:10:15.910 --> 06:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thanks Mr chairman um
 
06:10:19.708 --> 06:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
in the in the um interest of consistency
 
06:10:21.390 --> 06:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
this is the fourth time I've been able
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
to vote on this bill twice at the
 
06:10:26.310 --> 06:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
therapetic hodus medical oversight Bill
 
06:10:27.750 --> 06:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
and this will be the second time in this
 
06:10:29.590 --> 06:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee and I voted against it every
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
time um I really appreciate everything
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
that representative kofalt said because
 
06:10:36.910 --> 06:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything said um I think
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
there's probably better ways to address
 
06:10:40.830 --> 06:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
that one of the things we did was this
 
06:10:44.230 --> 06:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
morning the um the uh Greenhouse
 
06:10:46.110 --> 06:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
cultivation which will be a big one for
 
06:10:48.070 --> 06:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
increasing access to other strains that
 
06:10:50.468 --> 06:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
we don't have access to now and another
 
06:10:52.190 --> 06:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
build that we're proposing to increase
 
06:10:54.708 --> 06:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
the number of ATC dispensary sites which
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
can solve those problems I think
 
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
relatively safely having toward um um
 
06:11:04.270 --> 06:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
cultivation site and seeing the amount
 
06:11:06.468 --> 06:11:06.478 align:start position:0%
of science that goes into developing a
 
06:11:09.788 --> 06:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
reproducible product it's become quite
 
06:11:11.708 --> 06:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
apparent to me that it's virtually
 
06:11:14.788 --> 06:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
impossible for a typical lay person to
 
06:11:16.910 --> 06:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
do that on their own and get a product
 
06:11:20.190 --> 06:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
that is actually a reproducible thing
 
06:11:21.868 --> 06:11:21.878 align:start position:0%
there and I could go on that in detail
 
06:11:24.030 --> 06:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
if you want is to all the factors that
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
involved in getting something like that
 
06:11:27.230 --> 06:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think your typical
 
06:11:30.070 --> 06:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
person can do that and then then when I
 
06:11:32.350 --> 06:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
asked you know the folks um you know at
 
06:11:34.110 --> 06:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries and and people
 
06:11:35.670 --> 06:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this we don't think
 
06:11:37.070 --> 06:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
many people are going to do this anyway
 
06:11:39.430 --> 06:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
so I said there go well you can't create
 
06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
a reproducible product it's really not a
 
06:11:43.590 --> 06:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical product this is really
 
06:11:46.310 --> 06:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
not a therapeutic thing um I don't think
 
06:11:47.830 --> 06:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to support people growing
 
06:11:49.948 --> 06:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
opium in their own homes to do the same
 
06:11:52.230 --> 06:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
thing for opioid related products which
 
06:11:54.110 --> 06:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
probably have much more medical value
 
06:11:57.510 --> 06:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
than than cannabis does um I just think
 
06:11:59.350 --> 06:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
based on all that I just don't think I
 
06:12:02.708 --> 06:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
can support this bill ever um with that
 
06:12:05.628 --> 06:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
said I've been very happy to be a 20 19
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
to1 vote on this three times and I won't
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
be opposed to being it again in a fourth
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
but that's be won't be 19 to1 there's
 
06:12:16.070 --> 06:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
only 17 only 17 of us here so
 
06:12:16.080 --> 06:12:17.868 align:start position:0%
only 17 only 17 of us here so
representative

06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:12:20.350 --> 06:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
06:12:24.350 --> 06:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I was chairman of the committee
 
06:12:27.910 --> 06:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
to legalize marijuana for five
 
06:12:31.230 --> 06:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
years uh I I've never had an
 
06:12:33.868 --> 06:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
experience like that before in the
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
legislature that the intensity of
 
06:12:42.510 --> 06:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
feelings on both sides for and against
 
06:12:45.030 --> 06:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
legalization is still
 
06:12:49.910 --> 06:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
powerful uh I support this legislation
 
06:12:53.788 --> 06:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
because it heads in the direction of
 
06:12:53.798 --> 06:12:55.510 align:start position:0%
because it heads in the direction of
distinguishing

06:12:55.510 --> 06:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
distinguishing
 
06:13:00.190 --> 06:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
between uh the use of marijana for
 
06:13:03.830 --> 06:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
personal reasons versus the professional
 
06:13:03.840 --> 06:13:05.590 align:start position:0%
personal reasons versus the professional
reasons

06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
and that we heard from Jerry and I can't
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
remember he has a tricky last
 
06:13:15.948 --> 06:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
name right uh that committee recommends
 
06:13:15.958 --> 06:13:16.990 align:start position:0%
name right uh that committee recommends
this

06:13:16.990 --> 06:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:20.110 --> 06:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that's what influenced me
 
06:13:22.468 --> 06:13:22.478 align:start position:0%
those are the doctors who are looking at
 
06:13:22.478 --> 06:13:23.548 align:start position:0%
those are the doctors who are looking at
this

06:13:23.548 --> 06:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:25.868 --> 06:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
medication of
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana are are finding very
 
06:13:34.270 --> 06:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
specific uh uses for serious illness
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
including mental
 
06:13:40.230 --> 06:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
illness and because of that I see this
 
06:13:44.990 --> 06:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
as not a major solution but a step in
 
06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the right direction therefore I will
 
06:13:48.000 --> 06:13:49.708 align:start position:0%
the right direction therefore I will
support

06:13:49.708 --> 06:13:49.718 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
this anyone else any other comments
 
06:13:56.670 --> 06:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Mark yes thank
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman a couple of things come
 
06:14:00.590 --> 06:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
up in my mind is when I heard the
 
06:14:03.230 --> 06:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
original testimony on this bill it was
 
06:14:05.150 --> 06:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
represented that this was going to
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
appeal to a very small
 
06:14:10.070 --> 06:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
Market um the indications were initially
 
06:14:12.590 --> 06:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
that approximately 15,000 people have
 
06:14:15.350 --> 06:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana cards in this state
 
06:14:17.708 --> 06:14:17.718 align:start position:0%
however they made no representations
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
whatsoever as to what the size then they
 
06:14:22.430 --> 06:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
indicated there was a necessity or
 
06:14:26.190 --> 06:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
transport issue um dealing with the
 
06:14:29.070 --> 06:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
necessity um they never made a showing
 
06:14:31.510 --> 06:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
as to what number of people or even a
 
06:14:35.430 --> 06:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
rough estimate as to um what number of
 
06:14:37.590 --> 06:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
people would actually be growing this
 
06:14:39.430 --> 06:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
this particular material that's number
 
06:14:42.670 --> 06:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
one number two is is that I'm concerned
 
06:14:44.750 --> 06:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
about the addition I think as
 
06:14:48.190 --> 06:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel points out uh and
 
06:14:50.910 --> 06:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
as was also pointed out
 
06:14:53.548 --> 06:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
um what's to prevent these what's to
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
prevent people in this situation if they
 
06:14:57.868 --> 06:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
have that kind of financial need or
 
06:15:00.670 --> 06:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
they're that remote from growing it and
 
06:15:04.230 --> 06:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
then turning around and selling it and
 
06:15:06.750 --> 06:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh I realize that distribution of
 
06:15:09.310 --> 06:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the state is illegal but
 
06:15:10.708 --> 06:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
that doesn't stop people and I'm
 
06:15:13.350 --> 06:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if this AIDS and abets it uh
 
06:15:14.990 --> 06:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
number three the people who were the
 
06:15:17.750 --> 06:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill were asked about
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
the rep about the lead about the statute
 
06:15:23.310 --> 06:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh that exist the statutes that exist as
 
06:15:26.270 --> 06:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
to growing in surrounding
 
06:15:28.510 --> 06:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and uh they weren't able
 
06:15:30.628 --> 06:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
to discuss it in any way shape or form
 
06:15:32.990 --> 06:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
other than it exists so I had to take
 
06:15:35.350 --> 06:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
that upon myself and real and look up
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
the statutes myself uh they're they're
 
06:15:40.430 --> 06:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat different they're also
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
distinguishable on the grounds that um
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
our surrounding jurisdictions here also
 
06:15:48.590 --> 06:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
allow uh personal possession for
 
06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
non-medicinal use on that basis I
 
06:15:53.468 --> 06:15:53.478 align:start position:0%
distinguish it so I've looked at this
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that this is really
 
06:15:57.468 --> 06:15:57.478 align:start position:0%
good public policy beyond that I'd like
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
to go a little bit further and say as
 
06:16:03.270 --> 06:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
follows uh number one was I asked about
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
transport uh and I did make a reference
 
06:16:09.070 --> 06:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
to whether if you can deliver it almost
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
like a pizza I think it developed a
 
06:16:15.628 --> 06:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
little humorous response or or maybe
 
06:16:17.750 --> 06:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
even less than that and then we're
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
looking at a companion bill which allows
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
alternate grow
 
06:16:24.628 --> 06:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
sites um which allows which is going to
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
permit alternate grow sites for these
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
distribution centers and yet that they
 
06:16:30.788 --> 06:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
were talking about being able to
 
06:16:32.708 --> 06:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
transport it from their grow centers to
 
06:16:34.948 --> 06:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
their distribution centers under tight
 
06:16:38.310 --> 06:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
controls now if the case is one of two
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
things and the third the additional
 
06:16:42.868 --> 06:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
thing is is that they want to convert
 
06:16:45.110 --> 06:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
from nonprofit to uh be able to
 
06:16:47.350 --> 06:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
incorporate to some degree I'm assuming
 
06:16:50.190 --> 06:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
that's either going to be either an es
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
if they're going to file their taxes As
 
06:16:54.548 --> 06:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
an X Corp or a C Corp on this I don't
 
06:16:56.590 --> 06:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
know that you could that's for somebody
 
06:16:58.390 --> 06:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
else to decide if you're growing
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana but the point being that um if
 
06:17:03.910 --> 06:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to regulate and tightly
 
06:17:05.948 --> 06:17:05.958 align:start position:0%
control transport
 
06:17:09.070 --> 06:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
um why can't we have legislation that
 
06:17:12.110 --> 06:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
tightly controls delivery uh to to
 
06:17:15.110 --> 06:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
people to individual users and the other
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
representation that was made was that
 
06:17:19.468 --> 06:17:19.478 align:start position:0%
cost was a factor and so somehow you can
 
06:17:22.310 --> 06:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
grow your own and mitigate the cost well
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
if they're that concerned about their
 
06:17:27.150 --> 06:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
people number one and they want to
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
convert to a corporation which they said
 
06:17:31.030 --> 06:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
would give them a little more financial
 
06:17:33.510 --> 06:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility why not be able to use that
 
06:17:35.868 --> 06:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
incorporation Authority to be able to
 
06:17:39.390 --> 06:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
have a financial need-based program to
 
06:17:41.468 --> 06:17:41.478 align:start position:0%
give the people a break on their current
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
product that way we would be uh
 
06:17:46.430 --> 06:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
addressing those needs and at the same
 
06:17:48.590 --> 06:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
time I think engaging in prudent public
 
06:17:52.390 --> 06:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
policy by keeping uh quite frankly
 
06:17:54.390 --> 06:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
keeping marijuana out of the hands of
 
06:17:56.190 --> 06:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
people who shouldn't be getting it while
 
06:18:00.990 --> 06:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's still federally illegal and my and
 
06:18:02.788 --> 06:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
Beyond Beyond being an attorney who
 
06:18:05.110 --> 06:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
deals in federal and criminal defense as
 
06:18:07.590 --> 06:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
well as state criminal defense um that's
 
06:18:09.670 --> 06:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
a whole different matter but for those
 
06:18:11.310 --> 06:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
reasons I don't really think I can
 
06:18:13.510 --> 06:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
support this
 
06:18:16.110 --> 06:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
bill um representative lamon and then
 
06:18:16.120 --> 06:18:19.390 align:start position:0%
bill um representative lamon and then
representative

06:18:19.390 --> 06:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:23.670 --> 06:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
Nal yeah I I don't think that this bill
 
06:18:26.670 --> 06:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
has that much to do with um the
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or for-profit status of some
 
06:18:32.990 --> 06:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
of these companies I see this as a
 
06:18:37.030 --> 06:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
person who has has a medical U marijuana
 
06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
card for their condition wanting to grow
 
06:18:41.040 --> 06:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
card for their condition wanting to grow
their

06:18:42.070 --> 06:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:18:46.270 --> 06:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
own uh marijuana at home for their needs
 
06:18:49.468 --> 06:18:49.478 align:start position:0%
and anyone can do this without a card
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
but these are individuals who want to
 
06:18:55.868 --> 06:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
use this product for their pain or
 
06:18:55.878 --> 06:18:56.948 align:start position:0%
use this product for their pain or
whatever

06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:19:01.390 --> 06:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
reason um and they're not I I would
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
think they're probably less likely to um
 
06:19:07.628 --> 06:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
grow the marijuana to sell or to give to
 
06:19:09.628 --> 06:19:09.638 align:start position:0%
anyone else they're trying to meet their
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
own needs and stay within the law and I
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't really have a problem with it any
 
06:19:19.548 --> 06:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
more than you know someone that is
 
06:19:22.270 --> 06:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing their own beer you know
 
06:19:26.468 --> 06:19:26.478 align:start position:0%
it's it's for um their own personal
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
use representative Nel I I feel
 
06:19:31.990 --> 06:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
obligated to throw this in since this is
 
06:19:33.670 --> 06:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
a public hearing but I think I was one
 
06:19:35.708 --> 06:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
of the first doctors ever certify a
 
06:19:37.788 --> 06:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
patient for cannabis in this state I've
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
certified a lot of patients for cannabis
 
06:19:43.070 --> 06:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
in this state um I believe that it has
 
06:19:45.708 --> 06:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
value um more as an adjunct than as a
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
primary um medication but at the same
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
point I don't have a single patient that
 
06:19:53.350 --> 06:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
smokes it I don't have a single patient
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
that inhales it I don't have a single
 
06:19:57.190 --> 06:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
patient that Vapes it even the the
 
06:19:59.948 --> 06:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
dispensaries we try really hard to not
 
06:20:03.510 --> 06:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
use that mode of delivery as a method of
 
06:20:05.590 --> 06:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
of taking this stuff and it's same with
 
06:20:08.070 --> 06:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
opioids too injection is really a bad
 
06:20:10.750 --> 06:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
way to do it pills are a lot better and
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
so um when you're doing it at home doing
 
06:20:15.708 --> 06:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
it this way the odds are you probably
 
06:20:17.430 --> 06:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be smoking it which we just
 
06:20:19.270 --> 06:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
don't think medically is a good way to
 
06:20:22.270 --> 06:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
do it um but I just feel obligated to
 
06:20:26.270 --> 06:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
say that thank you other discussion
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative McKay thank you Mr
 
06:20:33.310 --> 06:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
chairman if I didn't uh mention this
 
06:20:36.708 --> 06:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
before Jerry caner who was the chairman
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:20:40.708 --> 06:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
committee uh was a professional
 
06:20:43.868 --> 06:20:43.878 align:start position:0%
doctors uh said that they voted to
 
06:20:49.590 --> 06:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:52.350 --> 06:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislation other discussion
 
06:20:54.548 --> 06:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
representative mlan yeah I mean I'll
 
06:20:57.270 --> 06:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
just be brief I think I you know I I I
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
respect representative Nagel's point
 
06:21:02.628 --> 06:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
about you know the complexity um with
 
06:21:04.910 --> 06:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the atc's and and what they
 
06:21:08.548 --> 06:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
do and the likely inability to replicate
 
06:21:11.150 --> 06:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
that at home you know that being said
 
06:21:12.750 --> 06:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things you will be able to do
 
06:21:15.030 --> 06:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
at home is not know that you're you're
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
making a product that's laced with
 
06:21:19.230 --> 06:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
fentanyl right and so I think that
 
06:21:22.110 --> 06:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's so while you're not getting that
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
same caliber of product there there
 
06:21:26.670 --> 06:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
there is still the the safety concern
 
06:21:28.468 --> 06:21:28.478 align:start position:0%
for me and I really think this just
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
allows people to to live within the law
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
if if you're looking to go and make a
 
06:21:36.990 --> 06:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
huge amount of marijuana you know for
 
06:21:40.468 --> 06:21:40.478 align:start position:0%
for sale to to third parties um you're
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
probably going to be doing that with or
 
06:21:44.510 --> 06:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
without this so I don't think it really
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
moves a needle in that direction so I
 
06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the Bill thank you Mr
 
06:21:51.948 --> 06:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
chair all right um I think that pretty
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
well addresses it so the motion is ought
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended on HB 53 I'll ask
 
06:22:12.990 --> 06:22:13.000 align:start position:0%

passes 13 to

four um that prevents us from calendar
 
06:23:27.390 --> 06:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
correig right PR yeah we can't I don't
 
06:23:29.830 --> 06:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
believe we can have more than two um
 
06:23:33.310 --> 06:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
against um will there be I assume
 
06:23:35.948 --> 06:23:35.958 align:start position:0%
probably not a minority report or will
 
06:23:38.830 --> 06:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
there be huh we don't need one
 
06:23:41.190 --> 06:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
no and it sounds like it would be a
 
06:23:43.468 --> 06:23:43.478 align:start position:0%
republican Republicans writing it
 
06:23:46.310 --> 06:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
probably if it if it were one and
 
06:23:49.510 --> 06:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
I okay that's usually found
 
06:23:53.750 --> 06:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
on we don't need one so no there's no
 
06:23:57.150 --> 06:23:57.160 align:start position:0%
minority no Minority Report but regular
 
06:24:00.070 --> 06:24:00.080 align:start position:0%

uh do you wish to speak brother to your
 
06:27:08.788 --> 06:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
motion yeah it's just a common sense
 
06:27:11.708 --> 06:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
bill that after a year of monthly
 
06:27:13.590 --> 06:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
prescriptions a patient can get three
 
06:27:15.830 --> 06:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
months at a
 
06:27:18.150 --> 06:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
time okay any other discussion
 
06:27:20.868 --> 06:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative Nal thanks Mr chairman I
 
06:27:22.788 --> 06:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
just love this solution for a really
 
06:27:24.910 --> 06:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
complicated problem um we he and I have
 
06:27:26.350 --> 06:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
been talking the sponsor and I have been
 
06:27:28.548 --> 06:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
talking about this for quite a while and
 
06:27:30.590 --> 06:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's the exact same solution we came up
 
06:27:32.590 --> 06:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
with people on long-term opioid
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
therapies that after a while it's
 
06:27:36.310 --> 06:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
functionally not helpful to make
 
06:27:38.310 --> 06:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
somebody have to go in every month to
 
06:27:39.948 --> 06:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
get something or every week to get
 
06:27:41.150 --> 06:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
something when they've shown that
 
06:27:43.548 --> 06:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
they're a good patient so I thought this
 
06:27:45.548 --> 06:27:45.558 align:start position:0%
was rewarding people for good behavior
 
06:27:47.628 --> 06:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
and I thought it was a good
 
06:27:50.468 --> 06:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
solution okay any other
 
06:27:52.590 --> 06:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
06:27:54.468 --> 06:27:54.478 align:start position:0%

06:28:52.430 --> 06:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
day and I know there was some concern
 
06:28:55.670 --> 06:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
over this and representative TZ you and
 
06:28:59.750 --> 06:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
I spoke about it I repres I'm Miss um
 
06:29:01.230 --> 06:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
not sure what her title I think she's a
 
06:29:04.110 --> 06:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
director director Rogers and I um spoke
 
06:29:07.310 --> 06:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
she's from the Department uh about 576
 
06:29:09.868 --> 06:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
FN and they understand that U it's an
 
06:29:12.230 --> 06:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
early Bill we want to move ahead with it
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
and uh they didn't seem too concerned
 
06:29:16.948 --> 06:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
about what you know I I told them what
 
06:29:20.270 --> 06:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
the likely outcome would be so um this
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
point representative um D I believe G to
 
06:29:26.830 --> 06:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:31.788 --> 06:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
this we 26 but okay no I H you down for
 
06:29:33.830 --> 06:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
576 unless you want someone else to do
 
06:29:37.390 --> 06:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
it sure um
 
06:29:41.830 --> 06:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
um we were doing it yeah I I moved that
 
06:29:44.070 --> 06:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh we itl on HB
 
06:29:46.830 --> 06:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
576 and wases Ma I believe you were
 
06:29:51.150 --> 06:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
seconding that yes do representative V
 
06:29:52.830 --> 06:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
motion or buy
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
guy um just real brief this is way too
 
06:30:01.030 --> 06:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
expensive for what it's doing it's a
 
06:30:04.190 --> 06:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
handful of people um I I don't see any
 
06:30:07.310 --> 06:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
point to it uh that I can also talk a
 
06:30:09.468 --> 06:30:09.478 align:start position:0%
little bit about why it's so expensive
 
06:30:11.390 --> 06:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
um tracking this data because they
 
06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned that they were
 
06:30:14.868 --> 06:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
using Salesforce to track this data and
 
06:30:16.430 --> 06:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
so what that requires is going into
 
06:30:18.910 --> 06:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
Salesforce and setting up a a data flow
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
for that specific data which is why it's
 
06:30:23.190 --> 06:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
so expensive
 
06:30:25.990 --> 06:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
so anyone else have any comments or
 
06:30:28.190 --> 06:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions concerns thoughts
 
06:30:31.910 --> 06:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tes um I had understood
 
06:30:34.468 --> 06:30:34.478 align:start position:0%
that we asked a lot of questions and
 
06:30:37.628 --> 06:30:37.638 align:start position:0%
wanted more information about potential
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
alternative databases cuz uh The Way It
 
06:30:43.350 --> 06:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
Was Written they costed it out in a
 
06:30:44.910 --> 06:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
certain way and we had a lot of
 
06:30:46.430 --> 06:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
conversation about exploring
 
06:30:48.030 --> 06:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
Alternatives so that's why I had hoped
 
06:30:50.948 --> 06:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
we could not execute
 
06:30:53.310 --> 06:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
today um you know representative TZ and
 
06:30:56.548 --> 06:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
I was speaking earlier about this and uh
 
06:30:58.830 --> 06:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
you know in the four years or going on
 
06:31:01.350 --> 06:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
five years I've been here especially as
 
06:31:02.788 --> 06:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
the three that I've been doing this as
 
06:31:05.430 --> 06:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I've always admired the fact
 
06:31:08.070 --> 06:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
that when we ask for information anybody
 
06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
we ask is very prompt about getting back
 
06:31:13.030 --> 06:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
to us because they recognize we're on
 
06:31:14.868 --> 06:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
timetables and and they never know when
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
the bill might get exact uh and plus
 
06:31:19.510 --> 06:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill and we at this
 
06:31:20.830 --> 06:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
point we're looking at having hearings
 
06:31:22.590 --> 06:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
even during school vacation week for
 
06:31:23.750 --> 06:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
this committee because we do have so
 
06:31:26.628 --> 06:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
many bills so um I think it's important
 
06:31:28.350 --> 06:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
that we move ahead with this but U
 
06:31:30.910 --> 06:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the committee is I mean I'm
 
06:31:33.430 --> 06:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to listen so representative
 
06:31:36.510 --> 06:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
Nagel with that with that said I think
 
06:31:38.910 --> 06:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
this it brings up important issues that
 
06:31:41.350 --> 06:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
they did not address in a cost effective
 
06:31:44.190 --> 06:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
manner I know there's better ways to do
 
06:31:46.788 --> 06:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
this is this a bill that we could retain
 
06:31:49.590 --> 06:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
and think about
 
06:31:52.150 --> 06:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
later I'm sorry for not bringing that up
 
06:31:53.830 --> 06:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
earlier but I never thought about it
 
06:31:56.590 --> 06:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
till right now well right now the motion
 
06:31:58.548 --> 06:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
on on the floor is itl so that would
 
06:32:00.230 --> 06:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
have to be withdrawn but I'm not sure if
 
06:32:04.030 --> 06:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
this I guess that again um during
 
06:32:05.910 --> 06:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on itl we can discuss if
 
06:32:07.548 --> 06:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
that's the the direction the committee
 
06:32:09.430 --> 06:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
wants to go in or if we want to um you
 
06:32:11.270 --> 06:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
know obviously it's got to pass this
 
06:32:13.030 --> 06:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee as to what the ultimate action
 
06:32:15.868 --> 06:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
is if itl fails then we could certainly
 
06:32:17.708 --> 06:32:17.718 align:start position:0%
discuss retain but right now we have
 
06:32:19.430 --> 06:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
another motion on the floor was there
 
06:32:19.440 --> 06:32:20.230 align:start position:0%
another motion on the floor was there
any

06:32:20.230 --> 06:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:32:22.750 --> 06:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
sorry that's kind of what I figured but
 
06:32:24.750 --> 06:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
I just thought I needed to ask it I I
 
06:32:26.590 --> 06:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
mean I I there's nothing wrong with
 
06:32:28.510 --> 06:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
letting this bill go home letting people
 
06:32:30.310 --> 06:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
sit down think about it work it out a
 
06:32:32.190 --> 06:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
lot better in a multi-stakeholder manner
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
come back and with a solution that's
 
06:32:35.430 --> 06:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
much more more cost effective than this
 
06:32:37.670 --> 06:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
and there's other people in the country
 
06:32:40.070 --> 06:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
that are doing this there's no reason we
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
have to be the ones and there's no
 
06:32:46.510 --> 06:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:48.910 --> 06:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
06:32:51.230 --> 06:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
lonte yeah I I would like to vote
 
06:32:53.868 --> 06:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
against the itl I I believe that the
 
06:32:53.878 --> 06:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
against the itl I I believe that the
fiscal

06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
06:32:58.670 --> 06:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
note uh was not realistic at all
 
06:33:01.948 --> 06:33:01.958 align:start position:0%
compared to what other states um have
 
06:33:04.670 --> 06:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
been able to implement Reg states that
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
have much larger population than we do
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it is a um there aren't that
 
06:33:12.670 --> 06:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
many cases but it's a very serious
 
06:33:15.070 --> 06:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
disease and we don't know what causes it
 
06:33:18.510 --> 06:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
and we have no cure and um by having a
 
06:33:23.230 --> 06:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
registry it's the first step to allow um
 
06:33:26.590 --> 06:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
you know both the individuals Medical
 
06:33:28.788 --> 06:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
Care they can gather a lot of
 
06:33:31.190 --> 06:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
information but for epidemiologists to
 
06:33:31.200 --> 06:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
information but for epidemiologists to
start

06:33:32.070 --> 06:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
start
 
06:33:36.510 --> 06:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
tracking uh where the cases are and it's
 
06:33:36.520 --> 06:33:39.910 align:start position:0%
tracking uh where the cases are and it's
really

06:33:39.910 --> 06:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:42.270 --> 06:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
important representative McLean thank
 
06:33:45.830 --> 06:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr CH you know La last year we um
 
06:33:49.150 --> 06:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
held over 15 to 20 bills and I know that
 
06:33:51.548 --> 06:33:51.558 align:start position:0%
we only had subcommittees really to look
 
06:33:53.868 --> 06:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
at two of them so we retained all this
 
06:33:56.190 --> 06:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
stuff to look at and because this is not
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
going into an interim study if this is
 
06:33:59.910 --> 06:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
retained we're just going to be dealing
 
06:34:03.430 --> 06:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
with this again uh in January of next
 
06:34:06.948 --> 06:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
year and I think um your comment that
 
06:34:08.868 --> 06:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
you know we had asked the department for
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
additional information and they're just
 
06:34:14.948 --> 06:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
in really seem to be a lot of fire there
 
06:34:17.868 --> 06:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
um I just don't know that we're really
 
06:34:19.910 --> 06:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to be doing a lot with retention
 
06:34:21.670 --> 06:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be back here again
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
next year so I would I would favor just
 
06:34:28.628 --> 06:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
going forward um and it Ling the bill
 
06:34:28.638 --> 06:34:29.910 align:start position:0%
going forward um and it Ling the bill
representative

06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
Palmer so I apologize because I missed
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
the hearing and and
 
06:34:38.350 --> 06:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
um my recollection from the last time
 
06:34:40.270 --> 06:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
around was that most of the cases are
 
06:34:41.750 --> 06:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
06:34:44.548 --> 06:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um
 
06:34:47.788 --> 06:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
and and I guess what I'm thinking and
 
06:34:49.548 --> 06:34:49.558 align:start position:0%
that one of the thoughts was that they
 
06:34:52.670 --> 06:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
would provide the data and I guess they
 
06:34:55.670 --> 06:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
decided not to do that and so I'm just
 
06:34:57.468 --> 06:34:57.478 align:start position:0%
wondering what the value would be if
 
06:34:59.310 --> 06:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
there relatively few cases and
 
06:35:01.150 --> 06:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
dartmouth's already following the cases
 
06:35:04.110 --> 06:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
that there are are we getting it not
 
06:35:06.030 --> 06:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
into our hands maybe but into the hands
 
06:35:07.750 --> 06:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
of people who are looking into the
 
06:35:10.868 --> 06:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
causes of ALS are we already getting
 
06:35:13.150 --> 06:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
about as much as we'll ever get in the
 
06:35:15.110 --> 06:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire since it's such a
 
06:35:19.150 --> 06:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
small state with so few cases I don't
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
know uh representative Nel my
 
06:35:23.868 --> 06:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
06:35:26.190 --> 06:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
actually the cases that are followed
 
06:35:28.430 --> 06:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
within the state that they're the ones
 
06:35:29.910 --> 06:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
that follow the most but there's a
 
06:35:32.548 --> 06:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
substantial number when you're talking
 
06:35:33.948 --> 06:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
26 cases I don't I don't know what
 
06:35:35.230 --> 06:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
substantial number means that are
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
actually fought in Massachusetts not
 
06:35:39.230 --> 06:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
here and that was what they wanted to do
 
06:35:41.868 --> 06:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
was capture that data too that was the
 
06:35:45.788 --> 06:35:45.798 align:start position:0%
whole benefit for it but um with that
 
06:35:45.798 --> 06:35:47.548 align:start position:0%
whole benefit for it but um with that
said

06:35:47.548 --> 06:35:47.558 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:35:51.070 --> 06:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
um this is a two committee Bill correct
 
06:35:53.350 --> 06:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
so we it is yes so it's going to finance
 
06:35:54.948 --> 06:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
and with that number it's never making
 
06:35:56.868 --> 06:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
it out of there so no matter what we do
 
06:35:58.990 --> 06:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's not going anywhere so we might want
 
06:36:01.468 --> 06:36:01.478 align:start position:0%
to just save them the pain and suffering
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
I guess representative kland
 
06:36:07.590 --> 06:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative T is um so I want to to
 
06:36:09.350 --> 06:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
Echo some comments that have been made I
 
06:36:11.948 --> 06:36:11.958 align:start position:0%
also want to acknowledge that um you
 
06:36:13.788 --> 06:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
know one of our colleagues uh The
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
Honorable Mark algro um passed away from
 
06:36:21.430 --> 06:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
this uh two years ago now uh and it was
 
06:36:25.270 --> 06:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
devastating to watch that um so I think
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
many of us would very much like to do
 
06:36:28.948 --> 06:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
something to help people who are
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
afflicted with this at the same time
 
06:36:34.230 --> 06:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
though I I don't see that this
 
06:36:36.628 --> 06:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that I I think that given
 
06:36:39.548 --> 06:36:39.558 align:start position:0%
the the very small number of cases and
 
06:36:43.030 --> 06:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that the the Right
 
06:36:44.948 --> 06:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
medical professionals already have high
 
06:36:47.750 --> 06:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
visibility to those cases I just don't
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
see it even if the fiscal note were
 
06:36:52.948 --> 06:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
substantially smaller than it is um you
 
06:36:55.270 --> 06:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
know retaining this bill I also agree is
 
06:36:56.548 --> 06:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
just going to we're going to circle back
 
06:36:59.628 --> 06:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
and probably come to the exact same
 
06:36:59.638 --> 06:37:01.230 align:start position:0%
and probably come to the exact same
result

06:37:01.230 --> 06:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
result
 
06:37:04.708 --> 06:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
um so I I I just think it is probably
 
06:37:06.590 --> 06:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
best for us to just make the decision to
 
06:37:10.590 --> 06:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
itl it at this point representative
 
06:37:14.388 --> 06:37:14.398 align:start position:0%
Tes thank you um
 
06:37:17.708 --> 06:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
I have learned in the functioning of
 
06:37:19.468 --> 06:37:19.478 align:start position:0%
this committee that we make the policy
 
06:37:20.788 --> 06:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
decisions and we let the fiscal
 
06:37:23.468 --> 06:37:23.478 align:start position:0%
committee do their part um so I would
 
06:37:25.350 --> 06:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
urge us to consider like everyone has
 
06:37:27.670 --> 06:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
said it's a very devastating disease
 
06:37:29.430 --> 06:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is no registry or place where the
 
06:37:31.628 --> 06:37:31.638 align:start position:0%
data is being collected and I didn't
 
06:37:33.548 --> 06:37:33.558 align:start position:0%
know about the cyano bacterium
 
06:37:35.388 --> 06:37:35.398 align:start position:0%
Association and I think it should get
 
06:37:37.708 --> 06:37:37.718 align:start position:0%
studied and the fact that rates in New
 
06:37:40.030 --> 06:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seem to be higher than other
 
06:37:44.070 --> 06:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
places so um I would urge us
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
to and and I I think what happened is it
 
06:37:50.350 --> 06:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't explicitly clear that we were
 
06:37:51.750 --> 06:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
expecting them to come back with more
 
06:37:53.910 --> 06:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
information like that that was clear in
 
06:37:55.468 --> 06:37:55.478 align:start position:0%
my head but I don't I've talked to other
 
06:37:56.708 --> 06:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
people I don't think everyone thought
 
06:38:00.670 --> 06:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
that was clear and so they would um you
 
06:38:02.948 --> 06:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
know uh with a little more time I think
 
06:38:05.150 --> 06:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
they would like to explore but again we
 
06:38:06.388 --> 06:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
don't know what that price would come
 
06:38:08.548 --> 06:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
down to I think we all agree it should
 
06:38:11.868 --> 06:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
be a lot less um so I would urge us to
 
06:38:14.430 --> 06:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
do the right thing from a health
 
06:38:16.708 --> 06:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you representative
 
06:38:20.270 --> 06:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
Maser while I appreciate the intent of
 
06:38:24.548 --> 06:38:24.558 align:start position:0%
this bill um I did make a note from the
 
06:38:27.388 --> 06:38:27.398 align:start position:0%
hearing that could this be handled by
 
06:38:29.590 --> 06:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee there was a
 
06:38:33.190 --> 06:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
mention of that in the hearing so taking
 
06:38:36.030 --> 06:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
this outside of where they recommended
 
06:38:39.510 --> 06:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
it go now um so that was you know that
 
06:38:42.150 --> 06:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
it could this could possibly this stats
 
06:38:45.190 --> 06:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
tracking could be handled elsewhere and
 
06:38:46.628 --> 06:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
without the fiscal note that they
 
06:38:50.190 --> 06:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
brought to us so that's I'm going to go
 
06:38:52.510 --> 06:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
itl just because I think there's there's
 
06:38:54.388 --> 06:38:54.398 align:start position:0%
other ways of doing this and this is not
 
06:38:56.590 --> 06:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
the way I will say that I sit on the
 
06:38:59.350 --> 06:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee along with um with
 
06:39:01.750 --> 06:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and um
 
06:39:02.868 --> 06:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative Woods you're going to be
 
06:39:06.708 --> 06:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
on that too AR you and um I know
 
06:39:08.110 --> 06:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy has been on there
 
06:39:10.270 --> 06:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
in the past a former member of this
 
06:39:11.510 --> 06:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'm the vice chairman of the
 
06:39:14.468 --> 06:39:14.478 align:start position:0%
committee uh chairman Mark Pearson um
 
06:39:16.150 --> 06:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
who's also under children and family law
 
06:39:18.270 --> 06:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
he's the chairman of that committee we
 
06:39:20.990 --> 06:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
do hear updates every month uh we meet
 
06:39:22.868 --> 06:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
the last Friday of every month we we
 
06:39:26.070 --> 06:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
hear about updates on um new system
 
06:39:29.510 --> 06:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
design we hear updates on uh Medicaid uh
 
06:39:32.230 --> 06:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
Dental the med Medicaid dental program
 
06:39:34.310 --> 06:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
and numerous other things
 
06:39:36.590 --> 06:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh so this is is something that could
 
06:39:39.830 --> 06:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
possibly be addressed in that manner uh
 
06:39:41.030 --> 06:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
I don't set the agenda for that
 
06:39:42.990 --> 06:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee the chairman does obviously
 
06:39:46.708 --> 06:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
but it C we do certainly handle other
 
06:39:49.868 --> 06:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
regular updates representative Nagel and
 
06:39:51.670 --> 06:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
if you do it that way you don't need a
 
06:39:53.750 --> 06:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
statute to do it it's a departmental
 
06:39:55.788 --> 06:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
thing and that that it solves the
 
06:39:57.350 --> 06:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
problem with if we were to ask the
 
06:40:01.230 --> 06:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner or any or Henry Litman or
 
06:40:02.670 --> 06:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
whoever the Henry liman is State
 
06:40:04.070 --> 06:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director or
 
06:40:06.070 --> 06:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
whoever uh you know they they've been
 
06:40:07.990 --> 06:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
very accommodating and and again that's
 
06:40:09.628 --> 06:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the oversight committee
 
06:40:11.708 --> 06:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
representative Woods yeah um I'm just
 
06:40:15.910 --> 06:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to than um um Bill know what you
 
06:40:17.788 --> 06:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
just said uh in terms of having
 
06:40:20.990 --> 06:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee um I forgotten two
 
06:40:23.030 --> 06:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
four years ago or something like that
 
06:40:26.670 --> 06:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
there was a big push um I think um
 
06:40:30.388 --> 06:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was pending that
 
06:40:34.430 --> 06:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh movement to completely redo just this
 
06:40:36.310 --> 06:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
issue the data systems and their
 
06:40:37.670 --> 06:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
interaction because they were so
 
06:40:39.708 --> 06:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
desparate and they couldn't talk to one
 
06:40:42.590 --> 06:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
another and and I forgotten the details
 
06:40:45.110 --> 06:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh but uh there was a committee
 
06:40:48.150 --> 06:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
established just to look at databases
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
and not just the database but security
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
and making sure they wouldn't be hacked
 
06:40:53.788 --> 06:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
uh like some of the other things we hear
 
06:40:58.190 --> 06:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
about um and so I I think to ask that
 
06:41:00.510 --> 06:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
question at the oversight committee
 
06:41:03.990 --> 06:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
would be uh would be that way I would
 
06:41:09.190 --> 06:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
think we should go with this um the um
 
06:41:13.230 --> 06:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
the study itself um uh is not providing
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
a treatment um and at the moment we
 
06:41:18.510 --> 06:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
really can't provide any prevention
 
06:41:21.030 --> 06:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the data uh so the
 
06:41:24.628 --> 06:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
data uh but this I just it was I made a
 
06:41:27.468 --> 06:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
note to myself uh fiscal Noe is totally
 
06:41:28.948 --> 06:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
out of
 
06:41:33.708 --> 06:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
whack um I just didn't quite to uh
 
06:41:36.548 --> 06:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
admittedly the data has to be fairly
 
06:41:41.190 --> 06:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
robust be because the data uh we don't
 
06:41:43.510 --> 06:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
know where people came from people come
 
06:41:46.110 --> 06:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to retire did they get
 
06:41:47.990 --> 06:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
their exposure in
 
06:41:52.350 --> 06:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
Texas um so it does have to be fairly
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
robust in the sense of very
 
06:41:59.110 --> 06:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
detailed um so I can see where it's it's
 
06:42:02.070 --> 06:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
not just a matter of oh you have ALS
 
06:42:04.670 --> 06:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
fine check the box thank you very much
 
06:42:07.430 --> 06:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
not that we're all done uh it's it is
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
more robust than that but still I this
 
06:42:11.788 --> 06:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
was way out of out of whack but it would
 
06:42:15.868 --> 06:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
also seem that interfacing with Dr
 
06:42:20.990 --> 06:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
stumble um uh when I I I actually had a
 
06:42:24.468 --> 06:42:24.478 align:start position:0%
bill five years ago uh which I pulled
 
06:42:28.548 --> 06:42:28.558 align:start position:0%
just because of secondary issues uh and
 
06:42:31.350 --> 06:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh to coordinate with Dr
 
06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
stumble um and almost be a
 
06:42:38.910 --> 06:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
repository for his data uh rather than
 
06:42:41.628 --> 06:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
generating any new data and I think
 
06:42:43.548 --> 06:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
that's something else that the oversight
 
06:42:45.350 --> 06:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee would have the flexibility to
 
06:42:49.750 --> 06:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
look at so I'm I'm going to vote itl
 
06:42:53.548 --> 06:42:53.558 align:start position:0%
with the hope that um our vice chair of
 
06:42:56.350 --> 06:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee can get it on the
 
06:42:58.548 --> 06:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
agenda I will definitely talk to the
 
06:42:59.788 --> 06:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
chairman about
 
06:43:02.750 --> 06:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
that representative Nel I'm sorry for
 
06:43:04.310 --> 06:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
throwing one more thing and but the
 
06:43:05.948 --> 06:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
other big problem that I had with this
 
06:43:07.750 --> 06:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill was that it's being referred to as
 
06:43:09.868 --> 06:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
a critical health problem and I don't
 
06:43:12.590 --> 06:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
think we ever fully really defined what
 
06:43:14.628 --> 06:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
a critical health problem means and
 
06:43:17.190 --> 06:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
something that affects 66 people in the
 
06:43:19.310 --> 06:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
state I think it's a big step to refer
 
06:43:22.190 --> 06:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
to it in that particular statute and one
 
06:43:24.590 --> 06:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
more thing Dr STL and I work on we're on
 
06:43:27.270 --> 06:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
the rare disease commission together
 
06:43:30.150 --> 06:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
and there's not definitely a clear
 
06:43:32.670 --> 06:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
association with cyanobacteria it's a
 
06:43:34.270 --> 06:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
theory of his he believes that
 
06:43:36.750 --> 06:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
environmental exposure is a signifant
 
06:43:39.070 --> 06:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
play may play a significant role he's
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
very interested in veterans there's a
 
06:43:43.190 --> 06:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
lot of veterans data on exposure to the
 
06:43:45.070 --> 06:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
things that they get exposed to so he's
 
06:43:47.468 --> 06:43:47.478 align:start position:0%
trying to prove a theory it's not that
 
06:43:51.190 --> 06:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
the theory is tied in stone yet so
 
06:43:52.788 --> 06:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
that's why they want the data so that
 
06:43:55.430 --> 06:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
they can prove
 
06:43:59.670 --> 06:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
Association other qu uh representative
 
06:44:03.708 --> 06:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
lante well um to representative Nagel's
 
06:44:05.388 --> 06:44:05.398 align:start position:0%
point though I think the
 
06:44:09.110 --> 06:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
only only by having a registry where you
 
06:44:12.388 --> 06:44:12.398 align:start position:0%
can um first make sure it's not the same
 
06:44:14.190 --> 06:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
patient being counted in Vermont and
 
06:44:16.110 --> 06:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's not just about
 
06:44:18.230 --> 06:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
collecting the numbers and it's being
 
06:44:20.670 --> 06:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
able to go back because yes maybe you
 
06:44:23.590 --> 06:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
would disprove that it's cob bacteria
 
06:44:26.788 --> 06:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
but you might find something else only
 
06:44:29.150 --> 06:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
by uh having the
 
06:44:32.350 --> 06:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
registry I can't believe that anyone who
 
06:44:35.230 --> 06:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
is diagnosed with ALS would object to
 
06:44:38.510 --> 06:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
participating in the research to look at
 
06:44:41.430 --> 06:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps where where they were exposed
 
06:44:43.468 --> 06:44:43.478 align:start position:0%
and what the cause might be and I don't
 
06:44:45.350 --> 06:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
I don't really understand how the
 
06:44:48.230 --> 06:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
oversight committee could possibly
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:55.750 --> 06:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
registry yeah it's not it's not a
 
06:44:59.150 --> 06:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
replacement but how is it solving the
 
06:45:03.910 --> 06:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:06.788 --> 06:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
yeah anyway representative
 
06:45:08.990 --> 06:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
06:45:11.750 --> 06:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I was the one the other day
 
06:45:14.310 --> 06:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
that made the fuss about the fact that
 
06:45:17.388 --> 06:45:17.398 align:start position:0%
it should have gone before the oversight
 
06:45:19.910 --> 06:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm trying to figure out
 
06:45:22.270 --> 06:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
how to vote
 
06:45:27.830 --> 06:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and so I take it that if we Vote
 
06:45:30.830 --> 06:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
IPL that somebody on the oversight
 
06:45:33.548 --> 06:45:33.558 align:start position:0%
committee will ask
 
06:45:36.788 --> 06:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
for that to come before them and I will
 
06:45:40.150 --> 06:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
do that I and again I can't I don't know
 
06:45:42.948 --> 06:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
I mean there there's a very specific
 
06:45:46.150 --> 06:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
statute that addresses the the mission
 
06:45:50.230 --> 06:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to do that I am yes I I
 
06:45:52.110 --> 06:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
can't promise anything but I will
 
06:45:53.388 --> 06:45:53.398 align:start position:0%
explore that and I will say if it's
 
06:45:56.190 --> 06:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
within our jurisdiction and and I can
 
06:45:58.190 --> 06:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
bring it up to the Medicaid director
 
06:46:00.388 --> 06:46:00.398 align:start position:0%
that I see him monthly at those
 
06:46:02.590 --> 06:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
meetings whatever appropriate personnel
 
06:46:06.910 --> 06:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:09.030 --> 06:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
I anyone
 
06:46:11.150 --> 06:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
06:46:15.230 --> 06:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
Woods I just I think going with the uh
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
and it may be a dead end but I think
 
06:46:19.708 --> 06:46:19.718 align:start position:0%
it's definitely the next uh Avenues to
 
06:46:22.150 --> 06:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
to go through the oversight committee uh
