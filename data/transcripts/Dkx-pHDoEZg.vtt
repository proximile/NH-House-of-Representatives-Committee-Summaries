00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
and basically it does address the uh
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
the extending the uh five-year term to
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%

amendment

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
number 1150h and would like to speak to
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
my motion
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
but is there a second representative
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
demon okay um one question I have is um
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
if I may this is 1291 this is 1291 I
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
think it's 1149
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
H so I have two separate amendments and
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
then I prepared one that combined the
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
both so I moved the one that combined
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
the two different amendments and I was
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
about to talk about that okay because
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
it's titled 1292 it says on the top 1292
 
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
it's titled 1292 it says on the top 1292
oh

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
wow that's myus that is a typo
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the amendment the new
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment at all they are moving down
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
the line I believe oh
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
okay um so that is a typo uh from OS
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
because that is not the correct bill but
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
I I would still like to speak to the
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
amendments in concept okay go ahead so
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh last time uh when in our discussions
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
we talked about the one Amendment um
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
that I brought forward that you have
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
from last time which changed we had
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
talked about this last year in our
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
multiple discussion sessions uh about
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
what parking requirements should be
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
required on or towns would be able to
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
require on an
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
Adu and most of the committee to my
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
recollection was in favor of one parking
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
spot per unit um in an attempt to get
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
the entire committee into consensus uh
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
we uh changed that to allow one per
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
bedroom however we ended up not getting
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
full consensus on the bill anyway and in
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
order to keep this bill in line with the
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
bill that we just passed which would
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
only require one parking spot per
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
dwelling or allow a town to only require
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
one parking spot per dwelling I've
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
changed that back to one parking spot
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
per unit rather than per bedroom and if
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
you think about we talked a lot about
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
well who is needing a parking spot if
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
you have two bedrooms very likely very
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
frequently rather a lot of that we're
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
intentionally trying to make these adus
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
larger so that they can be long-term
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
kind of family-based housing options for
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
people and so if you have kids they are
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
likely not driving um so uh that made a
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
lot of sense and in fact towns aren't
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
not um don't always and usually don't
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
require even one parking spot per
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
bedroom on a stick built single family
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
house so it seemed really uh over
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome to allow them to require one
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
per bedroom uh on an Adu so to keep it
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
in line with the bill that we just
 
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
passed um and for all the reasons I just
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I have the one amendment
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
that changes it back to one per unit
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
further and this will be the language in
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment 1149 which should have
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
just been passed around so this is the
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
second uh concept of an amendment we as
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
a committee just passed um a a bill kind
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
of um showing our support for the for
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
having options of manufactured housing
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
the current Adu law says that adus um a
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
municipality May prohibit accessory
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
dwelling units associated with multiple
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
single family dwellings attached to each
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
other such as tow houses that makes
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
perfect sense you don't want two adus
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
per townhouse in a that just then you
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
with like 12 units um and then it says
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
and with manufactured housing and so I
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
struck that and it it looks like a big
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it's duplicating the
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
entire paragraph but the only change is
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
on line 16 where the strike through and
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
with manufactured housing and the reason
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
um other than our committee's clear
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
conceptual support of increasing
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities with manufactured housing
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
um it really doesn't make sense to deny
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
an Adu associated with a single
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
manufactur housing uh unit on its own
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
land because right now for example a
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
house a stick built house can have an
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
Adu that is a manufactured uh house but
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
a manufactured house can't have a stick
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
built even though the stick built would
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
be smaller than the then the other way
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
around in either case you would have one
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
stick built and one manufactured house
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
on a property but we allow One Direction
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
and not the other direction didn't
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
really make much sense if that is a
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
manufactured house we we've spoke at
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
length about how the quality of
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing not only has come a
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
very long way but in many cases the
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
modern manufactured housing is actually
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
better quality than a lot of the stick
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
builts available that it really doesn't
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
make sense to unfairly penalize people
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
who have chosen a manufactured house for
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
cost and quality both by prohibiting
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
them from having an ad associated with
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
their home so uh for that reason I just
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
struck through and with manufactured
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
housing and uh and there you have it I
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
did reference the RSA 674 I went and
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
looked that up and it was just the
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
definition of manufactured housing it
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't specific to like on its own land
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
or anything so the amendment that is
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
improperly numbered which I will get
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
corrected uh combines those two concepts
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
in one yeah and and I'm I don't think we
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
need to because it changes the same
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
language we can adopt that Amendment
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
onto the we can adopt I've been told we
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
can and the reason I created the third
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
one we can adopt both separate
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
amendments uh separately and then OS has
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
to prepare a combined Amendment and then
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
we have to adopt that so um that's why I
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
went ahead and tried to have it prepared
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
ahead of time for the the speed and and
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
convenience of the committee but
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
failed okay there are there comments on
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment represent mcon thank you
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
going to your just turn your mic on
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and going to your Amendment uh
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
1149 and the last discussion you just
 
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:29.749 align:start position:0%
1149 and the last discussion you just
just

00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
had uh starting on line 15 M
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
municipality May prohibit accessory
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
dwelling you associated with multiple
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
single family dwellings attached to each
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
other such as tow
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
houses did did that also say at the time
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
and manufactured housing or are you
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
bringing are you now saying that it's
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay by right to do it in manufactured
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
housing the existing so everything
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's not bold in this is existing law
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
the existing law prohibits a allows
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities I should say to prohibit
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
adus associated with single family uh
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
dwellings attached to each other such as
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
tow houses that makes a lot of sense
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
because if you have like a fourplex then
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
every single one of those units were to
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
have a right to two adus you would be
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
kind of getting into crazy territory um
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
so that was fine but the existing law
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
also prohibits adus associated with
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and um if a we
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
heard a lot lot of testimony about how
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing has come a lot a
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
long way and is better quality and it
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to penalize someone
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
who has bought manufactured housing on
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
their own land on a foundation just like
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
anything else um and by prohibiting them
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
from having an Adu that did not make
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
sense uh the all the other restrictions
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
on adus would apply so they would still
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
have to uh the town would allow be
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to require that one of their two
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
if they had two adus one of them would
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
be attached um um all of the other
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
things would still apply we're just not
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
unfairly penalizing people who happen to
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
have a manufactured home on their own
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
land rather than a stick built on their
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
own land and as I said it doesn't make
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
sense because right now if you have a
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
stick built you can have a manufactured
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
home as your Adu but if you have a
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured home you can't have a stick
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
build as your Adu even though in both
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
situations you would end up with one
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and one stick built on the
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
same piece of land so uh that's why I
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
put that
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
in follow Struck it out thank you
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
representative and that's a wonderful
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
conversation just bring I just want to
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
bring you back to my
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
question so is are you now
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
permitting the Adu to be built on
 
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
because I see the line crossed out with
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing is that what you're
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
attempting to do okay so can I follow up
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
with one last
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
question so I wouldn't have a problem
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
with a private subdivision a private
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
piece of land that has a manufactured
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
house I don't have a problem with that
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's good my question comes and
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps it would go to well I'll
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
first in a manufactured home
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
park this could had this could have
 
00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
park this could had this could have
horrible

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
horrible
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
consequences so explain to me how you're
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
making this known that manufactured
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
housing parks are excluded or are are
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
you trying to keep them included in your
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation thank you my
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
understanding and the reason I didn't
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
parse it out is that parks and
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions can have their own rules
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
beyond what the town can do um I would
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
like to call upon the chair to ask Mr
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
Frost to come up and verify that but
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
that is why I did not go into detail
 
00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919 align:start position:0%
because I do agree with you that in many
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
of these Parks the lots are too small
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
and having two adus would be onerous for
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
each manufactured housing uhit but
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
having said that I am of the
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that a park and a
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
rules thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
everyone uh my name is Ben Frost I'm the
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
deputy executive director Chief legal
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
officer ature housing um to the the
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
colloquy between Representatives Reed
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
and mcon um yes uh parks in particular
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
Parks uh can have their own um their own
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
rules that would in effect prohibit
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units associated with
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
each unit in a park it's very similar to
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
a homeowners association which could
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
also have uh similar rules that prohibit
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
adus those those um override any
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
consideration of zoning U because
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're not it's not inconsistent with
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
zoning it's a private contract really
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
among uh the the uh in the case of a
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
park between the park owner and the unit
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
owners um in the case of a homeowners
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
association uh among the the owners in
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
that Association so it's very similar to
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
that in a um in a manufactured housing
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
Park subdivision and I'll note there
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
there are I think very few such things
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I I don't think there
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
are many communities that have adopted
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park Subdivision
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
standards that are different from stick
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
built or modular uh home
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
standards um but I know there are a
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
couple of them there I think uh it would
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
be up to the municipality to to decide
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
the correct lot size for that if it were
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
to accommodate um an accessory dwelling
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
unit because in many regards a
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park subdivision is
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
not much different than a regular
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision it's just the fact that it
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
has manufactured housing on it so I
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that's an an issue and and
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
honestly representative makoni you're
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
asking that question is the first time
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
I've heard that concern raised uh since
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Adu law law was adopted and this
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
provision of it was adopted um this uh
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
the prohibition against tow houses and
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
or giving municipalities the ability to
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
do that was a subsequent Amendment to
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
the Adu law adopted in 2017 the year
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
after the Adu law went into effect but
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
I've never heard that concern raised and
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think it's a concern of
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities okay so that's that's my
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
point and I appreciate you coming
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
forward so I shouldn't be concerned
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
about that that is my uh belief yes
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you Mr chairman of
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
course um anyone else representative
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
Reed I just wanted to add to Mr Fross
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
comments as he is well aware um in the
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
bill we are allowing towns to require uh
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
a half acre so in the subdivisions that
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
were mentioned a town could require a
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
half acre which is big enough for an
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
attached and one uh detached
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
Adu okay is there so let me ask is the
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
1150 even though the top says it's
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
amendment to 1292 if the chair would
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
prefer I mean I can email OS right now
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
or call Os step out if you want to
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
recess but if the chair would prefer we
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
can try to adopt each individual
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment separately and then try to
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
move forward let me ask other chairs for
 
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
guidance it's representative W there's
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
no substance because it's just a
 
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
technical error I think you could act on
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment so long as the motion was
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
specific to getting the the correction
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
made your other option would be you've
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
got two individuals that have accurate
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
numbers if you acted on them
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
individually it's just a matter of going
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
back to OS which you need to do anyway
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
to get them merged because they have to
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
be merged as a committee Amendment okay
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask can you resend your
 
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
moving 1150 and move those amendments
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
separately please yes Mr chair I
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion to adopt 1150 okay is
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
there a different
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
motion I would move to adopt only
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
because it's in front of me right now uh
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
1149 representative Damon would you like
 
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.389 align:start position:0%
1149 representative Damon would you like
to

00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
you any discussion on that I believe I
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
just covered this is the one that simply
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
strikes out the words and with
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing so I we basically
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
covered that and and the issues around
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
that so I think I'm all right unless
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
people have concerns are there any other
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
comments on this
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none all those in favor
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is show a hands okay
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
all in favor any
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
opposed was it opposed I'm not okay all
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
right yes the amendment's been
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
adopted is there another amendment you'd
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
like to move I would like to move
 
00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:25.389 align:start position:0%
like to move I would like to move

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
that was passed out last time this is
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment that uh changes the
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
0730 do I have a second thank you so
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
move by representative Reed second by
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on this
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
Kell hey
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
um can you remind me of the uh
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill that you are trying the bill number
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill that you are trying to be in
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
um parallelism with uh that we already
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
said one no more than one per per unit
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
or one per dwelling unit yes right yes
 
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.389 align:start position:0%
or one per dwelling unit yes right yes
and

00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:37.399 --> 00:26:43.630 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
ah400 which if the chair wants to verify
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
I believe we um adopted an amendment for
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.789 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
okay is this is everyone ready to vote
 
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.669 align:start position:0%
okay is this is everyone ready to vote
on

00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
this seeing nothing is simple is pass on
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
the just the amendment option okay all
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
those in favor of amendment number 0730
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
please raise your
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
hand those
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
opposed okay nine is 9 to one the motion
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
carries the amendment's been adopted so
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
now we're on the a to pass as amended
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
motion adopting amendments 1149 and 0730
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
AG which OSS will put together provided
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
this passes so is there discussion on
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
motion go ahead represent Walsh I will
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
not belabor it because I don't believe
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is any surprise but I will not be
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
supporting this uh nothing has changed
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
since what I said on day one of this
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee is that I cannot with my
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
experience on a planning board for
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
almost 13 years adopt top down one siiz
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
fits-all state mandates on our
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities local control I know we
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
talk about it all the time I think is
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
critical in in in these matters that's
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
why even at the local level
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
understanding that you don't have one-
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
siiz fits all work there either there is
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
a waiver process and a variance process
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
once you put things in statute that all
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
goes away and secondly looking at just
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
how this would work I Mr Frost in the
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
past has said we do a good job in hooks
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
it and I apologize because I keep
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
referring to it but that's my closest
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
experience is that we do a good job and
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
I look at this Halfacre with with
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
mandating municipalities to to do this
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
in our particularly in our conservation
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in our cluster subdivisions
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
all our smaller subdivisions now
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
potentially um the density would
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket I just cannot see how this is
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to work without severe problems
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
and not and quite honestly not fair to
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
the people that are already already have
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
those properties uh if something like
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
this gets adopted I hope all your local
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
Boards of assessors are prepared for the
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
line at the door looking for relief from
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
their property taxes because once you
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
have a ranch that's a th000 square feet
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
just so you know a 2640 Ranch is just
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
over 1,000 square feet so we're not
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
looking at adus here we're looking at
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
homes sandwiched in between in between
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
people's swimming pools there is going
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
to be a detrimental effect on the
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding people's properties those of
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
the people that put these
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
in look I came on this committee looking
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
for Solutions I think we did a lot of
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
good work on that in terms of
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
streamlining and making things more
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
affordable but this I just could never
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
get behind and so you know a lot of
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
people can even the Hampshire Municipal
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
Association is not behind these bills
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
either it just goes too far I'll leave
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
it at that thank you representative um
 
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.269 align:start position:0%
it at that thank you representative um
representative

00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair uh I just want
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
to make a comment with regard to the
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
parking issue and something that was
 
00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:06.039 align:start position:0%
brought up uh in our in our last meeting
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
um that once something was built that
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
increased parking could not be added and
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
in fact um I know that once something
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
has been built if increased parking is
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
needed increased parking can be added
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I know this is
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
that I live in a condo development that
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
was built with one parking space per
 
00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:28.710 align:start position:0%
was built with one parking space per
unit

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
and uh quite recently um within the last
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
year or so uh the uh driveways and um
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
parking spaces were resurfaced and while
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
they did that they created three
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
additional parking spaces for visitors
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
so this was long after it had been built
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
because I moved into it um in uh
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
1988 and uh as I said within the last
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
year increased parking was was created
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
as part of the process of resurfacing
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
the parking spaces so I just wanted to
 
00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:07.269 align:start position:0%
the parking spaces so I just wanted to
add

00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
that representative Reed thank you Mr
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
chair I wanted to address some of the
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
comments um that had been made so this
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
is not a one siiz fits all this is a
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
floor that we have already put on
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities to accept 1 Adu and
 
00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:24.039 align:start position:0%
allowed certain restrictions and we are
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
changing that floor because we are in a
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and we have to too
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
because you can talk about like well we
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
like the look of this or the that or
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
whatever but when it comes to it as what
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know similar to the comment that was
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
made last time we don't have a parking
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
crisis we have a housing crisis we don't
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
have an Aesthetics crisis we have a
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we don't have a you know
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
barriers around our swimming pools
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
crisis we have a people cannot live in
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
this state and we can't keep people who
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
can work in this state in this state
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
crisis so it's not one- siiz fits all
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
there are abilities for towns to
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
restrict this and that um and it's it's
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
it it there is still power within the
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
municipality and if you heard um in
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
hma's opposition to the bill they
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
actually supported several aspects of
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
the bill because I worked very closely
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
with them um having said that for people
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
who have been planning these communities
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
for a decade or two decades or bought
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
their homes a decade or two decades ago
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
the housing situation looks very very
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
very different now very different and we
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
are at the point that we are going to
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
cause a collapse of our economy in New
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we won't have workers
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
in in 10 or 20 years um the cluster
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
issue and conservation the half acre um
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
does provide those you know barriers
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
around your swimming pools or what have
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
you I mean even in that statement alone
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like tells like we're worried
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
about how much room is in our around our
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
swimming pool but we're not worried
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
about people going on the street like
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's a little that that's a
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
little telling but the conservation
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
issue um it's not going to be overly uh
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
clustered or overly dense because that
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
town can still require a half acre which
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
is not that much I want to be very clear
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the two adus does not like I think
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
people are thinking there's going to be
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
one house and then two extra houses on
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
the same lot that's not what this does
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
because one can be required to be
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
attached so what you can have at maximum
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
if a town uses their power to restrict
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
it you might at most have either a house
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
with an extension so it's still one
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
house with an extra house a smaller
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
house and 1,000 square feet is nobody's
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
idea of a big house um or you'll have a
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
house with a detached garage which you
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
don't know an Adu is in and then one
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
extra house so there's no there's no
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
ability or no forcing of towns to allow
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
a property with a house with two extra
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
houses or like three house structures on
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
on one property that's not the case I
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear about that because
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
I think that was a
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding but the fact of the
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
matter is this is the gentlest density
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
um of the I love everything this
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee has done we have not fixed the
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we have not made housing
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
affordable in this state with the
 
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
parking and the the couple things that
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
we've passed so we haven't fixed the
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
housing problem here um this will get in
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
the least impactful uh and easiest EST
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
way get to that victory garden approach
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
that decentralized owners are building
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
at their own time scale it's not going
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
to be a mad rush on second adus we don't
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
even have a mad rush on first adus
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
because of the restrictions right so
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be gentle over time where
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
you don't even see that there's an Adu
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
going in that garage or an Adu being
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
built onto that house um but we are
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to provide and I think the number
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
was something like um and this came from
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
oh gosh who who testified they they
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
figured out the number that um might be
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
overtime added in terms of our housing I
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
think they said something like 990,000
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
units could be built um or based on the
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
percentages of people who currently add
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
adus that would really kind of fix our
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
housing shortage issue maybe not the
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
affordability issue but the shortage
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
issues certainly and affect the
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
affordability so for all those reasons I
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
the concerns that have been raised are
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
um not from an objective standpoint and
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of this
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
state and what's in the best interest of
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
property owners and I will close by
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
saying once again of all the um
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
solutions that we talk about this is the
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
only one that I've seen legitimately
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
with the ability to pass that will help
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
people buy homes because it's not just
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
renting homes that yes that would be a
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid on our housing issue if people
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
could afford rent but what we want in
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
this state is home ownership what people
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
young people with families moving to
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
this state to work in the state want is
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
home ownership this allows them to own a
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
home because they might have rental
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
income that helps them defay the cost of
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
a mortgage this is amazing we should be
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
doing this and so with that um I will
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
just end there okay thank you
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%

um there there there's passion and
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's going over the
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
top and um I will stand with my fellow
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
chair who has the right to say whatever
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
he wishes and not to be in my opinion
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
braided I was a strong yes on this but
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you after that I may
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
not hold that position we all come to
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
this committee from different point of
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
views we all came to this committee
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to make a
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
difference whether we whether we get
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
there as 100 or 91 or
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
92 um we we need to look at every
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and every Bill and make a
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
determination and I would appreciate it
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
could condense some of this
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
conversation speak to the bill and not
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
to the passion thank
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair um I apologize
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
for anyone who felt that my remarks were
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
personally disrespectful or insulting um
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
I believe all of my remarks at least my
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
intention was to stay with the concept
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill and the purpose and intent
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill and the reason that the bill
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
is needed I don't believe I spoke to
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
anybody personally but if anyone felt
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
that way uh that was not my intention to
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
hurt anyone's feelings or make them feel
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
disrespected and I certainly believe in
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
not disrespecting my fellow committee
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
members regardless of their opinion on a
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for that representative
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr chair well you didn't
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
hurt my feelings but I was insulted by
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
the comments because it was clear you
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
were directing that to me just let me
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
give you another perspective on why I
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
still have an opposition to this and
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
again thank you for that representative
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
we do come here with different
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
perspectives I have two when I make my
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
position on this uh clear I live on a
 
00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.630 align:start position:0%
position on this uh clear I live on a
Halfacre

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
Halfacre
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
lot and I'm also a builder so when I can
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
say to you that if I took my house on a
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
Halfacre lot and put an attached and a
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
detached on it there is no room for
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
anything else if this bill actually said
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
a higher lot Dimension or a larger lot
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
Dimension I might actually look at it
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
differently but starting at a half inch
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
with allowing basically three units on
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
it I I I'd see as a disaster so thank
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
chair represent VI
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
Kell okay thank thank you uh Mr chair
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh um for the comments from the
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee so far um my thoughts on this
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
this um Bill
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
are a couple things I wanted to address
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that that were
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned um one
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
was regarding um the concern
 
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.790 align:start position:0%
was regarding um the concern
about

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
um the value of people's homes going
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.079 --> 00:39:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
area

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I personally don't I I have not seen
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
any evidence of that with the adus that
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
we have currently um and
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
I would I actually fundamentally
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
disagree with the idea that you have a
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
right to the value of your property um
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know on the open market but um even
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
even if that is an accepted uh reason
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
for denial of variances and stuff like
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
that um I still being on a being on uh
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board of adjustments I've never
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
seen someone successfully argue that
 
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
their town that their value of their
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
property is
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
reduced um by any of the proposals
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
actually coming be before me they they
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
may make some
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
claims um but they've never actually
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
proven that that
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
is actually going to harm their value
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
um and and and definitely not not uh for
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
adus um my thoughts on the the size
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
requirement is is
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
um that with the second Adu I think
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
there already is a uh provision that uh
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
allows municipality to require
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
larger uh Lots but I think that the main
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
value in this bill is not
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
actually um the second Adu as much as it
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
is the first Adu because you can't get
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
to the second Adu until you get the
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
first Adu and and so my my issue with um
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
our structure in this state right now is
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
that we've when we did limit the Adu or
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh the municipalities right to restrict
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
your right your personal right to Adu on
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
your property um we we made
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
the the
uh

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
municipality you know take its hands off
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit unfortunately we did not
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually take make them take their hands
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
off enough that people were actually
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
able to make adus in the situations that
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
they had on the ground whether that be a
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
detached garage that they that's where
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted to put the Adu
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
um instead of you know building on an
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
addition which we've heard can cost an
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of money or
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money um where
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
putting it inside an existing structure
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
as someone that actually probably lived
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
in what would be called an illegal Adu
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
um in another state inside of a a a
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
garage that
 
00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
um you know didn't have permits and all
 
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
of that stuff um
 
00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:05.309 align:start position:0%
of that stuff um
was

00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh very relatively cheap to to put in
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
because the garage already had a heater
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
and the garage already had you know uh
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
other walls and insulation and stuff
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
like that that making a m uh uh you know
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
an additional couple of walls to put
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
that Adu in inside of the the garage was
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
um much less uh
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
intensive than the $100,000 that we've
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
heard quoted in this we're talking on
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
under probably $10,000 that this um you
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
know couple of walls some insulation and
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
some 2x4s and some Carpeting and you
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
know a light fixture um
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
made uh another room that I that I was
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
able to stay in
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
and so I think that in some sense I I do
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
believe that the um that this is
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
definitely more affordable and um I most
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of the change of um detached
 
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.910 align:start position:0%
supportive of the change of um detached
to

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
be outside of existing structures right
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
and saying that um if if you're in you
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
know that that detached garage that is
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
5T away from your 5T away from your
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
actual living space um that you don't
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
have to build that Corridor in between
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
um to make it attached before you can
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
put the Adu in that you can just put
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
that Adu in that space if that's where
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
it um is appropriate based uh according
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
to the the property owner I I value that
 
00:44:57.309 --> 00:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
I think that is the um a significant
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
change and I think that um coming down
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
from the unreasonable amount of allowing
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
for parking spaces for an Adu is a huge
 
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.270 align:start position:0%
for parking spaces for an Adu is a huge
Su

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
Su
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
success um and so I think those barriers
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities put in the way
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
utilizing the existing law uh is I
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
believe um you know outweighs any
 
00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:29.150 align:start position:0%
believe um you know outweighs any
potential

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue um that people could have with
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
with having a second Adu I think the
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's flaws in the first Adu law that
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
this this bill seeks to remedy so I
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
think that's uh why I will be supporting
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
it so thank you thank you uh
 
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
it so thank you thank you uh
representative

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I vigorously
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
support this bill although I do
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the concerns that have been
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
noted I think we need to remind
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves not only does it make it more
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
possible for first homeowners probably
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
younger folks to in fact own property it
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
helps elderly people stay in place
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
because they can put in an Adu for folks
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
to help them if they have care needs as
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
they age or to make it affordable for
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
them to stay where they are and we heard
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
poignant many testimonies from the
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
disabled community
 
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
about how valuable this would be to
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
those folks to have two adus so that
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
parents a disabled Offspring adult and a
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
caregiver for that person could all have
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
their separate Living Spaces on the
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
property I think that's a community that
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
we really need to be addressing it's not
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
small and it's not
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
unimportant there are other reasons as
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
well but particularly
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity for elderly people
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
to age in place and for disabled people
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
to live well in a comfortable and
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate environment I am vigorously
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
supportive thank you representative
 
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.510 align:start position:0%
supportive thank you representative
representative

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chair um I also
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill and I just
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh go into the question of um
 
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh what the property owner might choose
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
to build because I do think it should be
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
the choice of the property owner whether
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
that owner would choose to build two
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
adus or something else uh the owner
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
might choose to build one Adu and a
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
garage or one Adu and a swimming pool or
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
one Adu and something else I don't know
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
what um my point is that it should be
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
the choice of the property owner so that
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
even if uh the house the original house
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and two adus would take up all the space
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
that that should be the choice of the
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
property owner not my choice or or your
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
choice or the or the choice of the uh
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
zoning board but rather the choice of
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
the property owner so long as that
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
property owner isn't interfering with
 
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.390 align:start position:0%
property owner isn't interfering with
anyone

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
else Mr thank you represent represent
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
berui and then represent dorenzo thank
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
chairman um being a realtor I've seen a
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
things I remember one of the last um
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
back before the housing crisis I listed
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
a property with an in-law apartment
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
course we don't have them
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
anymore but um before the housing crisis
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
when I took a house a couple of months
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
to sell I listed a house with an in-law
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
apartment and I had like 12 calls on
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
it this that people bringing in their
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
elderly parents instead of sending them
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home they want them in
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
their home so you know they can take
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
care of them themselves and um there was
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
a high demand and very very few
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
properties like that this would take
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
care of that with the housing CR crisis
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
today and affordability it has another
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
role young people can't afford an
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
apartment on their own they want to go
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
back home but if I'm a 28 or a 30y old I
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to live with my
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
parents so give me my own space and I
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
think it it brings in the elderly so
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
that the family can take care of them
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
and it takes care of the younger people
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
who are having a hard time making it out
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
there and there's a lot more of them
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
now back when we had in-law apartments
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
we had a shortage of units like this we
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
have a real shortage of units now so I
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
think this would help out in a multiple
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
ways thank you representative lenzo
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I feel like we're
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
at a um an imp pass and I want to know I
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
want this committee to decide what what
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
do we feel can work um it sounds like we
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about parking we're
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
talking about you know two adus one Adu
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
whatever um what's going to work where
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
can we compromise so that we can get
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
this done um I think we put a lot of
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
work into this representative Reed has
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
put in an enormous amount of work in
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
this and um I don't want to throw the
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
baby out with a bath water because we
 
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
can't disagree because we can't agree on
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know what the model should be thank
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I'm sorry to disagree
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
with representative D Lorenzo um but my
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
feeling is we should vote on what we
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
have in front of us uh before we talk
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
about whether there's a need for
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
compromise uh perhaps there is and I'm
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
not I'm not um uh putting down any of
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we've had they are
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
obviously real concerns um but I think
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
we should uh have a try at voting on
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
what's in front of us and then see where
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
we go from
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
there okay I'm
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
gonna quick thing quick um I just wanted
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
um because I forgot because we we
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
postponed this but the testimony from
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
the person last week about essentially
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
being um fearful about their living
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
situation um long term and that that an
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
Adu was essentially um kind of creating
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
that hope and that bridge of consistency
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that was a really
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
powerful testimony to me and um I think
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
that you know that kind of goes along
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
with representative what representative
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
Damon was talking about as far as the
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
disability Community needing that
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
support um and so for th that um I just
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to acknowledge that was you know
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
just bringing my mind back to that that
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
testimony and it was very powerful to me
 
00:52:03.839 --> 00:52:05.390 align:start position:0%
testimony and it was very powerful to me
and

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
um I think that it was it's worth to
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
just remember
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
that so I grew up in a single family
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in conquer and it was it's
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
up on the east side so if you know any
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
anything know about conquer there's a
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
lot of very nice single family
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood there's the conquered
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
Country Club um I did not live there but
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
like I lived up in in that area um
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
beautiful single family neighborhood it
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
was built
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
like um a little bit at a time and my
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
house happened to be the last one built
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
but the Acres I just text my dad I was
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
like I want to know quickly this kind of
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood what was the acreage on our
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
property which is one of the largest
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
ones it was 32 of an acre it was a
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
beautiful neighborhood 32 of an
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
acre and you know you had that cookie
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
cutter Colonial houses up there um I
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
think that's still important that we
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
preserve that I I truly do I think
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's a part of our identity especially
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
up here in the Northeast and I think the
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
language in here allows that to be
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
preserved right because you have a
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
single family neighborhood with a 32 of
 
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
an acre 04 of an acre municipalities are
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to say you cannot do this on
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
anything lower than 0.5 of an acre so
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
the language in here allows for this
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
single family neighborhood idea that we
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
already have and like we support and we
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
love but also allows the freedom of a
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
property owner that has a larger
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
property they can build that and I also
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
want to just point out that there was a
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
wur article that came out yesterday
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
about how Dover um is partnering with a
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
um a bank a credit union to allow for um
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
better financing for um adus in
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
particular I think the you know the
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
private Market is working with the with
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
public sector in such a way that I think
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
we're all moving in this direction where
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
people have the right to do what they
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
want on their own property I think
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities if they want to preserve
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
that single family neighborhood Hood
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill still does that um I think
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're striking a really good balance
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
here so I think this is a good bill that
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
we should vote for and try to um try to
 
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.430 align:start position:0%
we should vote for and try to um try to
get

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
done go ahead representative Reed thank
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um the Halfacre was very
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
intentional as representative D Lorenzo
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
commented um I've been working for about
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
two years on this bill and in total
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
about four years and I solicited the
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
input of the municipal Association of
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
num numerous planners not just my own
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
Town's planner but Durham's planner and
 
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
it was the consensus between the
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
planners that I uh uh consulted that the
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
Halfacre was good and these are towns
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
that are relatively dense I also live on
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
a Halfacre lot and it has out buildings
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
two out buildings and um where I live is
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
not a full Adu it's kind of like an
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
unofficial Adu but it doesn't have a
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
kitchen so it's not really um but um
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's still predominantly a a wooded lot
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
it is overgrown and wild and you would
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
not know that it has all these now we
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't have adus in the out buildings
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
because the town won't allow that but
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood itself is highly highly
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
highly desirable with very high values
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand the idea of these
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
values going down because as anyone
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
knows as any realtor knows a property
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
with an Adu or in this case perhaps 2
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
adus is a much more sought-after and
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
valuable property the value of to adus
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
of course not only can you have your
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
aging parent or your adult child living
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
there but you can still get rental
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
income um aside from that so um as has
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
been pointed out quite fairly I think we
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
should always uh operate on the merits
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill I think this committee has
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
worked very hard over about a year on
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
this concept hearing from every single
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
corner of the advocacy World from PR
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
housing and homelessness issues to
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
builders and Realtors and pro business
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
people and everyone every pretty much
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
every corner is in agreement that this
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
is not just good but needed it's
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
happening in other states um and the um
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
the movement we've had from Fanny May in
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
particular to ensure that the rental
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
income for an Adu can be uh considered
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
in a mortgage to buy a home has been um
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
quite good with that I would like to
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
move the question so we're not allowed
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
to move the questioning committee I'm
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
going to let everybody speak first um
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
but if you don't have anything new to
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
add I recommend you do not add in
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
anything new anything else I going to
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
call a question okay we can't call a
 
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
question representative Walsh one quick
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
one not expecting to convince anybody
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
just to clarify a few things um I am not
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
here opposed to the Adu statute that we
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
have for all the reasons described on
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
who it can help with your in-laws with
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
your kids with the with the disabilities
 
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.029 align:start position:0%
your kids with the with the disabilities
uh

00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
Community but in terms of um the
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
assessed value I just want to clarify
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
this I don't think that the adus are
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to diminish the property value of
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
the house that's got them it's the ones
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
that are on either side of them and I
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
know representative you said you had had
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
a case of this with an attached Aid to
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
you and I believe that why would you
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
because they're attached I see and I'm
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
telling you you're going to see it when
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
they are single family homes behind
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
single family homes people on each side
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
of that are going to be uh complaining
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
and and seeking relief another thing
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do it says 1,000
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
square ft now you would really want to
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
see a neighbor after the assessing board
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
what if it's 500 square ft two floors
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
high with a 1212 pitch um shadowing the
 
00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors's pool and I know that's the
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
nimi argument but these are real things
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
and I guess if you haven't been into
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
building to see this in for yourself
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
what building something here actually
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
does to something over here I'll leave
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
it at that uh I just again it's it's the
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's expansion that I can't get behind
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
not adus in general okay does anybody
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
have any anything new to
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
add thank you very much so we're g to um
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have the clerk call the

amendment represent mcon thank you Mr
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um if I could ask uh represent
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
Wallace so um I especially I I believe
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
what I heard you say earlier when we
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
started talking about this so this um
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
the subdivision for instance has been
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
approved and you're extending the time
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
from 5 to 10 years so uh the standards
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
for or variances were granted nine years
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
previous no one could change that if
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
zoning had changed correct I'm I'm in
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
sir any other discussion on the
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:14.390 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
yella

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
yella
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
um there
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
was just kind of building on
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative makon um question I
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
don't I'm more familiar with like zba
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
because he he was talking about like a a
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
a variance granted would be um allowed
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
for 10 years and normally I believe that
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
variances are for two years and so um
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
but I don't see any two years getting
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
crossed out and going to f uh 10 years
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so I'm
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
just I wanted to get some clarification
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
on what
 
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.349 align:start position:0%
on what
is

01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually if if the um if the uh V if the
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
um subdivision is
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
approved um that seems like that would
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
be for 10 years but if there was a
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
variance um for you know setbacks or
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
whatever on a specific lot in that
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
subdivision that that would still only
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
be uh that would need to be started
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
within two years is that am I
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that cor we're not
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
addressing variances the variance would
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
be associated with an issued building
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
permit at that time
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay represent mcki thank you and I
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
misspoke with when I said that so I
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
apologize um I'm I'm just making I'm
 
01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
just making sure that if this plot of
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
land was allowed with those setbacks and
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it was at that point in time
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
that those would be carried forward even
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
if there was a zoning change that
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
occurred within 9 years that is the
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
intent in the whole Genesis of this bill
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the confusion thank
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%

municipality uh zone for single family
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
residences they would essentially be
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%

lines 5 through nine that's
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
essentially uh the main thrust of this
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill and then everything else is
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions um and and saying um you know
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
it can't require Demolition and it can't
 
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
it can't require Demolition and it can't
require

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%

some if there's like water issues um
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
that they you know in the municipality
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the capacity for it
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
that that some that this unit uh you
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
know expansion to two units would be
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
able be disallowed for 10 years so that
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
they can um address those you know sewer
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
and water capacity issues on their you
 
01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
and water capacity issues on their you
know

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh in their uh you know if they have a
 
01:06:44.269 --> 01:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
water and sewer uh Municipal Water and
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
Sewer so that they can address those
 
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.029 align:start position:0%
Sewer so that they can address those
um

01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
and um yeah so I think that like there's
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
just a whole host of the these
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
um um like exemptions um and I believe
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
that most of these uh exemptions to the
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
two residential unit are are
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
specifically and the reason why this
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill is so long is specifically because
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
of people um bringing up situations
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
where it's not appropriate to be doing
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
these two
 
01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
um automatically allowing the um two
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
residential units um and so obviously ly
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
these uh that those exemptions were uh
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
considered by the prime sponsor and
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
and put into the bill and that's what
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
okay um represent
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you I might as well just
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
speak to the issues I have with this now
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
um first of
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
all um I have no isue with duplexes as a
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
matter of fact most of my town is medium
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
density residential which allows them
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
and we have no problems I'm specifically
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
just talking about the writing or the
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
language in this amendment which
 
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
essentially would become the bill I
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
guess the biggest problem I have is um
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
on page two paragraph 4 lines 7 through
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
13 um if
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh if a town does not have adequate
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
water or sewer capacity to allow this
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
development in parel subject to
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer proposed
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
housing developments may be disallowed
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
for 10
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
years so you can say the 10 years is
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
giving the town time for a capital
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
project which may be outrageous to
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
perform uh what happens if the town
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it now they have a right to
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
build these things without water and SE
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
I mean there there's a huge hole in what
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
happens here and the reason I say this
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
these are these can be huge capital
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
Capital uh projects and this is a one-
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
siiz fits-all again to give you an
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
example hooks that was created in
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
1822 and up until last year we didn't
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
have water and sewer on the west side of
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
the river so that's what the problem
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
with one siiz fits all maybe it's a
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
small project but it could be a large
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
one this doesn't address that so I mean
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
I have others but that's that's the big
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
one for
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr shair um just in
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
reference to the previous comment and
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
again I'm not um putting down the
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
concern that's been expressed I
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
understand that it is definitely a real
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
concern um but I I have two um uh points
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
to raise one is that um after within 10
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
years um and I'm not claiming to be an
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
expert on on these issues uh but within
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
10 years it might be possible to make an
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment to Water and Sewer capacity
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
that did not require a major
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhood wide um Capital project uh
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
the other is uh that you mentioned that
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
in hookit you did not have water and
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
sewer on the west side until very
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
recently um but uh as I understand it
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
and I used to live in hookit uh although
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
not on the West Side uh that people did
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
live there so it is possible to live
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
without City Water and Sewer and I say
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
this because I grew up uh where we had
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
no City Water and Sewer uh and so long
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
as my family lived there we did not have
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
it and the reason that we never had it
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
even when the whole rest of the 40
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
square mile Township did have it was
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
because we lived on the other side of
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the New Jersey Turnpike from the rest of
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
that 40 square mile uh Township and
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
nobody was willing to uh um uh expend
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
the tax money that would have been
 
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
needed to drill underneath the turnpike
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and extend the pipes uh out to where my
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
family lived on the very edge of of the
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
township uh so um our our family had to
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh deal with the septic system and well
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh for for all the time that that we
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
live there um and I I'm sure that um
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh was not suggesting
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
that it's impossible to live um
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh without City Water and Sewer uh I'm
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
just bringing this up because I have the
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
personal experience of living without
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
it representative Walsh yeah and again
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to belor I'm looking at
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
the language if the municipality has
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
proven through an engineering study that
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
it does not have adequate water or sore
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
capacity nothing's going to change in 10
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
years if the engineering study provided
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
that except you could be pushing
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities into spending a lot of
 
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.350 align:start position:0%
municipalities into spending a lot of
money

01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh to solve a project the problem I see
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
is that the bill or the language is
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
silent on what happens after 10 years if
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
the town hasn't CED up the money to fix
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
the water and seore issues and
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough on the west side of
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
hookit the municipality still didn't
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
have the money to do it it's actually
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
the water and stores being put in as we
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
speak by being funded by a
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
developer who will get then get repaid
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the increased taxes it's a it's a
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
develop ER funded Tiff what could
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
possibly go wrong we'll stay tuned on
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
what happens when this one's done uh and
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I said most of our town was medium
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
density except the west side which for
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
the sore and water reasons is why it's
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
you represent V thank you um and I find
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
it uh interesting that that the
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh uh focused his his
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
um his efforts on on this L line 7even
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
through 13 because it was exactly the
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
same same uh language that I was um
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
working that that raised my hairs on on
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
previous amendments and um and uh was
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
actually changed yesterday to um to what
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
we see here today um because of some of
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
those concerns uh that I raised last
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
week with the bill sponsor um I
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
is silent on
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the language as far as you know
 
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
is that lot so we're talking about one
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
additional unit on a lot that already
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
has one unit so that would be one more
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
let say uh uh connection or or capacity
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
flow if they're using the same
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
connection um going through to the um
 
01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
sewer and
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
water and it it does say that you know
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality is allowed to say okay
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
this one more um connection or one more
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know residential unit getting
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
pushed onto our uh water and sewer is
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
not allowed for for for 10 years and
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
then on on line 12 and 13 it says not
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
withstanding the sewer
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
cacity um so you might be disallowed
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
just based on the sewer capacity for 10
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
years but then once
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
you um are no longer disallowed based on
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
the sewer capacity obviously you don't
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
want to just say hey if you have the um
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
the this
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
engineering study that you can just sit
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
on your hands and never do anything
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
about this engineering study
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
forever um there needs to be you know
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
the town knows that there's an issue and
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
they need to be planning and and moving
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
towards with uh addressing that issue um
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
however uh so I I understand that there
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be a deadline and and
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
essentially saying like hey
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
um one the 10 years is up they are going
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to if they can meet the other
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
state requirements for water and sewer
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
and that may be that that that property
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
now has to have a
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
a a septic and well in addition for that
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
additional unit and not actually hooked
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
up to the water and sewer for that land
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
but it's still they still need to
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
actually S have a plan to solve it it's
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's saying that you still have to meet
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
the other regulations for water and
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
sewer so they don't get to you know just
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know go to the Wild Wild West
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
once the 10 years is up um but I do
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
think that this so this puts kind of
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
like um I think some some pressure on
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
the municipality to try and address it
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and not if they know that this is an
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
issue that try and address it in 10
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
years and if if it can't be addressed
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
then the person that is is trying to put
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
that second unit that they are going to
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to be able to have
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
that second uh unit that meets the
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
state's regulations for water and sewer
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think so I think that you
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
know uh kind of threads the needle as
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
far as as um being pushing the
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
municipality but not mandating that they
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
actually do that you know complete those
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh those uh you know inreased
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
capacity uh requirements within the 10
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
years thank you um I have a question so
 
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
represented Walsh based on your
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
experience on planning board I have a
 
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
question regarding um page two lines 14
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
through 18 that says that a mpal may
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
deny a proposed housing development
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
project if the state makes a written
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
finding based on proponents of evidence
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that propose Housing Development under
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
this section with have specific adverse
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
impact on public health so
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
the way I read this is would would you
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
be able to deny it if the sewage
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure was not good enough and
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
it would damage the entire system and
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
provide like adverse effect on the rest
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
of the neighborhood it says provided
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
there's no um feasible method to
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
satisfactory mitigate it so like
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
feasible means to me like it's too
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
expensive it's not feasible at this time
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the way I read that part right
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and maybe maybe we can adjust the
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
language a little bit but
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
um economic feas well economic feasibly
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
but also I see like the the
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure yeah the infrastructure
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
isn't good enough for the for the
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
proposed expansion well to answer your
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
question yes they can obviously every
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
system has a capacity whether it's
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
supplying water or removing waste uh
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
they're built for a certain amount of
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
Capac I mean cubic feet so so the
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
municipality could still deny now that's
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading now just to to see if
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
section paragraph D would
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
supersede number four let me read it
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
again well I I
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
see it says if the state makes a written
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
finding but maybe if we change that to
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
municipality makes a WR finding based on
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know an engineering report or
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
something that they
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
get go ahead represent w real quick if
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
you don't mind but I mean it's not often
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
and again I'm just looking at the way
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
this is written it's not often that you
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
have one paragraph Just eliminate
 
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
another I'm really looking at the way
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
this is written um even no if if
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph D could negate number four
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
then why would we have number four um I
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
guess is my it it seems
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
moo um I'd have to let me read this a
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more um again my issues are
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
with the way the bill is crafted okay so
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on if possible
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
represent MC Williams can you please
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
explain um because you drafted this
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
weici welcome thank you very much it's a
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here and um thank you for
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
giving this bill the time that it
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
deserves to really talk about exactly
 
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
what we're attempting to do um so as uh
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
my co-sponsor representative yella
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
explained the intent is to allow allow
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
duplexes with a whole bunch
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
of ways to exclude duplexes based on
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
discussions that we've had with
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
different participants in the process
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
um so the two that we're really focused
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
on right now are on page two um
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph number four and then uh sub
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph D under four so lines s
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
through 18 is pretty much the discussion
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
right now um and I just want to give you
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background because I
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
think it's important to understand where
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
both of these are coming from so to
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
start with uh section four the
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
engineering study um this really is for
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
NASA I can see this also being for
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
hookit but um we have a lot of
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
representatives from NASA who were very
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
concerned with this bill's predecessor
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
which is the fourplex Bill we condensed
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
and came back with duplexes this year um
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
NASA was very concerned because of their
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues with sewer capacity right now um
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
and so understanding that naswa needs
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
5,000 units immediately but we'll
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
definitely need more than 5,000 units in
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years um there's sort
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
of this Balancing Act between where are
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
we going to put them and how are we
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to handle sewer capacity um and so
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
having met with several reps from naswa
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
to talk about the concerns it seemed as
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
though a 10-year period for naswa to
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
figure out how to bond and address their
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
sewer capacity was fair um it was enough
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
time for them to be able to do it um and
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
then going back to meet with my
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor representative yella to
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
really talk about well what happens if
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
they don't do it in 10 years what
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
happens if they can't afford to do it in
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
10 years and so understanding that there
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be a way for these duplexes to
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
still go in to meet needs demand desire
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
and address our housing crisis um the
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
idea was okay if you can find a way that
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
you meet state regulations the last
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
sentence but does not address the water
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
and sewer capacity issues then you can
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
still do it after the 10 years the way I
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
see this actually playing out and I want
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
to be very clear for the record is that
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably um someone will say I'd like to
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
put in a duplex in Nashua and the town
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
will say no we have an engineering study
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
the clock runs we have a 10-year clock
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
starting immediately after they're
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
rejected in year nine you're going to
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
see a whole bunch more people jumping on
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
the bandwagon saying oh I understand we
 
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year clock and we also would
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
like to get a duplex as soon as this
 
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
clock is up um I expect that Nasha would
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
say all right um we've done everything
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
that we can and depending on how things
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
play out politically there's one of two
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
Avenues either it's been addressed and
 
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
it's resolved and so we don't need to go
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
further or risk management it hasn't has
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
been addressed it hasn't been resolved
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
and ashaa says we're getting a new
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
engineering study now to see if
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
anything's changed or if any of the
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
small projects we've done in the last 10
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
years might change capacity they do the
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
engineering study and for the subject
 
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
Lots some of the subject Lots they're
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
still not going to work my my
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
envisioning of this is that would
 
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
trigger another 10year clock starting
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
from the next rejection in year nine
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
moving forward again so now we're
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking a 20-year term where the
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
duplexes just can't happen on certain
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
Lots because because the parcels are
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
subject to city and water and sewer
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's no way to do a well or a septic
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's a small lot it's not possible and
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
so therefore those just don't work um
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
but it's really it's really in nashua's
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
court to make the decision as to whether
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
or not they do the upgrades they can
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
afford the upgrades or if they do
 
01:23:14.669 --> 01:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
another engineering study and kick that
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
ball down another 10 years down the road
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the reality is not every lot is
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
possible to do a duplex on and I think
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
this paragraph is kind of crafted to
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
create that OPP opportunity if it can
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
exist and if it can't okay we've
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
considered it we've run it through all
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
the options it just can't happen um and
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
it it is a balancing act between the
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
city and the folks who want to do a
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
duplex and maybe could do a duplex if
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
the capacity was upgraded and we'll see
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
how it plays out um obviously some of
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
the things that we do as a legislature
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
are really meant to be a first pass and
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have been known to come back and
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
change things several years later um I
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate that some of the stuff that
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
comes out of this committee may end up
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
getting changed a year or two or three
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
later because we're still figuring out
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
what the repercussions are um so moving
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
on to paragraph D line 14 this is a
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
separate consideration and the reason
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
this was in the original bill is really
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
about environmental factors um so let's
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
just say you're looking at a wetland for
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
example um so this was would be
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
something that's reviewed by Dees it
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
would go to a council they would
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not you can do
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
development in an area that contains
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
Wetland and they may say absolutely not
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
this portion of the site cannot have a
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
duplex on it because it's a wetland end
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
of story and that's the state's finding
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
um so if it's related to something that
 
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
the state reviews right because it's the
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
state making the written finding then
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a higher level analysis
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
than if it's the municipalities finding
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
I did not mean for D to be another bite
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
at the Apple for city of nasua um and I
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't meant it to mean for it to be read
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
that way um although I suppose you could
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
probably have NASA bring in the state to
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
do an analysis of their capacity for um
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
sewer and water I think big picture the
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
goal here is to make sure that a site if
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
it really is environmentally a poor site
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't end up being subject to duplexes
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions yeah
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
there are there questions representative
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh representative mck
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
Williams I just want to clarify
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
something because I had read this as um
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
the 10-year window uh would be
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
application by by application that is
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
essentially duplex by duplex um rather
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
than at at year nine a whole bunch of
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
additional Property Owners coming in and
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
wanting to add duplexes um because one
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
additional duplex might not um uh be a
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
serious problem even if the the the uh
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
city is shall we say on the edge of
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
capacity one additional duplex might not
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
be a problem
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
but 10 additional duplexes might be a
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
serious problem uh so was this intended
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
to be application by application duplex
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
or duplex duplex by duplex or was it
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
intended to allow a whole bunch of other
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh applicants to jump in on year nine uh
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
so the intent here and the plain
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
language was revised to address this um
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's on line 10 for a term of 10 years
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
after the first proposed Housing
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
Development M so one just one
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
application triggers the the clock and
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
so that does create a situation where
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
there is pent up desire and potentially
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
lots of applicants in year nine I'm I'm
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
certainly open to changing that if if I
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
could get some support from other
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee in order to
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
make it more drips and drops rather than
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
a deluge of applicants in year9 if that
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
would be something the committee would
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
support I could I could see it going
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
either way um I don't have have a strong
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
feeling that we must allow a whole bunch
 
01:27:00.189 --> 01:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
of applicants in year nine expecting a
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
tital wave um but in the same hand it
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
seems as though from an administrative
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
perspective if you are a municipality
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
managing all these applications it would
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
be easier to remember one date than
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dates for the time
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
period yeah and then you would get one
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
engineering study instead of an
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
engineering study every single time
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's a duplex application right well
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
the engineering study is good for the
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
first 10 years but then you'd have to
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
keep yeah it just seems like an
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
administrative burden but I understand
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
the desire not to create a situation
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
where you have many applicants towards
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
the end of the term because everyone's
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
kind of sitting on pins and needles
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
saying what's going to happen what are
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
we going to do if nothing has happened
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
yet by that year okay other questions
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
for representa MC Williams go ahead
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
representa mcon thank you uh thanks for
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
taking the question um I I'll finish on
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
on where we've started and then I have a
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
second question for you so my concern
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
when this hits the floor is I live in a
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
I live in a town and I'm and I don't
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
have sewer and water and sewer and water
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
could be a well in the towns I represent
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
could be 10 miles away most of the towns
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
have some Central but it's the the rural
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
is so much
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
bigger so the way I read this is I'm the
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
only person that thinks this is a great
 
01:28:23.239 --> 01:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
only person that thinks this is a great
idea

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
and I come to the town and I sayi want
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
this at my
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
property and 10 years go
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
by and um town of wolfboro for for a
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
number of years which is not my district
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
but very close was at capacity and
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
stopped all additions of anything that
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's and that went on for 10 15 years
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
until they finally figured it out but
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the only person and the town must
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
expend a lot of money millions of
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
dollars to connect to me I I don't think
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that I should be
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that by right so that's
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's my first problem can I respond to
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
that that's fine so you don't if you're
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
the one who really wants to do this and
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
you don't currently connect to Municipal
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer so you would fall under
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
um on page two line to section two
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
residential units connected to an
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
on-site wastewater treatment system so
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
you would have your own septic I'm so
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
glad you brought me to that section
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
because that's question two okay section
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
two a residential units and I'm trying
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
to help you I'm not trying to be behind
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
here residential units connected for
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
on-site wastewater treatment as it's
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
written documentation from a permitted
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
septic designer the septic system is
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
adequate for the for the the capacity of
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
development you did a lot of work you
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
got Dees involved but we didn't go far
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
enough in my opinion that should read
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
for residential units
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
connected to an to an a on-site
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment the owner will be
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
responsible to have a New Hampshire
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
permitted septic designer provide an
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
nhds subsurface construction approval
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
for for the increased use said septic
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
system must be installed prior to the
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
issuance of an occupation of a occupancy
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
permit so going back to it's it's not
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
enough to contact a
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
designer the design and this is this has
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
been a lot of the rub about the first
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
Adu Bill the first Adu bill is the only
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
regulation in the state that says I want
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
to add on to an existing use I have but
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have to build anything until it
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
fails so that that got through that got
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
through that's been passed that's part
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm saying if if I'm out in the
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
country and I want to do it I would
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you but I should have to
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
provide everybody that documentation
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
that that could
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
happen so let's say I have a lot that I
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
cannot do that on let's say I'm I'm uh
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
I've got a steep lot I'm too close to
 
01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:28.709 align:start position:0%
I've got a steep lot I'm too close to
the

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
water um there are wetlands on that
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
property which precludes me from getting
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
that state approval so I can't get that
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
so now I want the municipality to bring
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
water I I don't think I think that's a
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
great burden on municipalities and I
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
think we're going to lose the bootes we
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
need in the house so to be clear to
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
respond to that scenario yeah I think
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's already been ruled out that you
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
cannot do the needed septic on that site
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's too sloped it's too wet whatever
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
site on line8 where we talk about
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
adequate water or sewer capacity to
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
allow the development in Parcels subject
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
to Municipal Water or sewer so unless
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
your parcel is currently subject to okay
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water or sewer I don't believe
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
it rises to the level of demanding that
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
five miles of water and sewer run out to
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
your sloping parcel that currently is a
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
septic parcel because it's not subject
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
to Municipal Water and Sewer I suppose
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
we could change that to currently
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
serviced by if subject two isn't clear
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
but the intent here was never to trigger
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
um additional Millions to be expended by
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
a municipality for someone who's looking
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
for a back door to get their duplex okay
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
would you uh if I could would you agree
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
to additional language in line
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
two yes I love the proposal that you
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
gave me if you have that written down I
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that that's a fair amendment I I'm
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
open to other committee suggestions but
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
I think that that is very fair and
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns we've seen with
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
adus with preliminary language not
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
really working out in the real world
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions for
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams
 
01:33:19.119 --> 01:33:20.950 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams
representative

01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um this is isn't
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually uh a question on the um uh on
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
the septic systems and so forth um
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
although I agree that uh what was just
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
suggested um is probably an excellent CH
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
an excellent change um but I think that
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's one additional thing that hasn't
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
been considered and this would make more
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
sense actually if there were a group of
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
um delayed uh uh additions that would be
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
coming that would be coming in at the
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
end of the 10-year period and that is
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
that and again I'm not an expert on on
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing uh but if an
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
additional group uh would be coming in
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
say I don't know 20 uh delayed uh
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
additional developments would be coming
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
in at the end of at the end of the 10
 
01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
in at the end of at the end of the 10
years

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
um the taxes of those Property Owners
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
would rise
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
and might it be possible for the city to
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
bond its Capital Improvements on the
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
basis of the fact that when those
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
additions um were
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
added that additional taxes would be
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
coming into the
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
city I I do believe that that is
 
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
allowable and a city could choose to do
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
that I do want to draw your attention to
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
page two line 5 Section 3 a municipality
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
May charge impact fees for new
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
connections to Municipal Water and Sewer
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
services so I would expect that there
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
would be a cost passed on to each of
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
these new proposed duplexes where there
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be an upgrade or a connection
 
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
for the first
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
time are do you have a
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
question represent yell is that a
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
question it's not a question no okay are

there
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
questions okay so thank you
 
01:35:23.119 --> 01:35:25.310 align:start position:0%
questions okay so thank you

so that that's my question so
 
01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.149 align:start position:0%
so that that's my question so

coni the last day to act on Bill is not
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%

makon representative makoni can you talk
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
about the change that was made in the
 
03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
amendment thank
 
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
youed the language of the original word
 
03:02:58.349 --> 03:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
just put your mic
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
on expanded the wording on
 
03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:05.870 align:start position:0%
on expanded the wording on
page

03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:03:11.469 --> 03:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
to um to uh instead of having to uh
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
consult with a septic designer if I
 
03:03:16.229 --> 03:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
remember right I don't have this in
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
front of me to require that the
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
owner um obtain a construction approval
 
03:03:26.269 --> 03:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
from a septic a permitted septic
 
03:03:31.150 --> 03:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
designer for the uh property and uh
 
03:03:34.030 --> 03:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
construction approval means the septic
 
03:03:36.830 --> 03:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
design has been submitted to the
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
department and that the new loading is
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
under consideration they agree that they
 
03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
could a new septic system could be built
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
on the property
 
03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
um and then I'll go to my line two
 
03:03:54.590 --> 03:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
residential units connected onsite
 
03:03:57.070 --> 03:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
Wastewater system the owner shall
 
03:03:58.910 --> 03:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
provide proof of a New Hampshire
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
Department environmental services
 
03:04:03.389 --> 03:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
subsurface construction approval for the
 
03:04:05.710 --> 03:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
increase septic loading so you know that
 
03:04:08.950 --> 03:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
the lot will handle uh whatever is being
 
03:04:11.469 --> 03:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
proposed to be built and upon the
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
Department's issuance of approval of the
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
03:04:18.429 --> 03:04:18.439 align:start position:0%
operation uh so it's a two part process
 
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
you need a septic Design This is the
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
property and the property will will hold
 
03:04:26.429 --> 03:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
it and part two is they need to build it
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
put it in the ground and when it's in
 
03:04:31.469 --> 03:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
the ground the state will come by and
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
inspect it and it'll be issued what they
 
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
call an operational approval so we're
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a double check to make sure
 
03:04:40.750 --> 03:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
homeowner puts it in the ground and it's
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
approved for operation before the town
 
03:04:49.950 --> 03:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
gives them the occupancy permit so it
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
protects protects the
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
environment representative Walsh yeah
 
03:04:56.910 --> 03:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and this is for
 
03:04:59.229 --> 03:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you for that
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
language and I'm just asking a
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
question notwithstanding paragraph two
 
03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
or sub paragraph two if paragraph 4 is
 
03:05:09.520 --> 03:05:11.870 align:start position:0%
or sub paragraph two if paragraph 4 is
still

03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
still
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
there and I thought this whole thing was
 
03:05:17.070 --> 03:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that the subject property did
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
not have the
 
03:05:22.190 --> 03:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
capability of a new septic system or
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
well I thought that was the reason for
 
03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 just because exit paragraph
 
03:05:31.469 --> 03:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
two is there why would not paragraph
 
03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
four Still Still kick in in terms of
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
03:05:39.469 --> 03:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
municipality well paragraph two has to
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
do with properties that aren't connected
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
to City
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
Wastewater in sewage four is connected
 
03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
four is has to do with properties that
 
03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:59.349 align:start position:0%
four is has to do with properties that
are

03:05:59.349 --> 03:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:59.359 --> 03:06:01.550 align:start position:0%
 
connected

03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
connected
 
03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor of the bill previously
 
03:06:09.389 --> 03:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
pointed us to what is now line nine
 
03:06:11.389 --> 03:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
where it says subject to
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal in uh allows this development
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
in partials subject to the Municipal
 
03:06:21.309 --> 03:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer so if they're not if
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have sewer and water then
 
03:06:24.590 --> 03:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
they would be covered
 
03:06:28.469 --> 03:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
under subse section two if they do have
 
03:06:30.790 --> 03:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
it they would be under subsection 4 and
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
then if the whole if the state finds
 
03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue then that would be
 
03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
sub then that would be D so
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
there's hopefully all three of those are
 
03:06:44.790 --> 03:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
independent of each
 
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
other um go ahead repres thank you maybe
 
03:06:50.269 --> 03:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
this is just a Dawn breaking over Marble
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
Head paragraph sub paragraph 4 did not
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
change so that's also for areas that do
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
not currently have Municipal Water and
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
sore that's the whole reason for the
 
03:07:02.510 --> 03:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
term up to 10 years in the denial but it
 
03:07:04.710 --> 03:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
still says that after to 10 years
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
nothing changed in it then then they
 
03:07:10.590 --> 03:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
will be able to build by right and I
 
03:07:11.950 --> 03:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
thought that's what the prime sponsor
 
03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
said as well this is assuming that you
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's no capacity on the site for
 
03:07:19.950 --> 03:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
personal water and Waste Systems which I
 
03:07:21.550 --> 03:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
think they can do
 
03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:23.429 align:start position:0%
think they can do
now

03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
right representative Wallace thank you
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it was discussed previously
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
today in in committee that the subject
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
to Municipal wat was synonymous with
 
03:07:35.279 --> 03:07:37.190 align:start position:0%
to Municipal wat was synonymous with
connected

03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
connected
 
03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
to we did have some discussion about
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
changing that language but apparently
 
03:07:43.229 --> 03:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
that didn't occur I'm fine with it the
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
way it is but that's subject to again is
 
03:07:49.469 --> 03:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
analg to connected
 
03:07:54.030 --> 03:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
to and 10 years hence if we still didn't
 
03:07:56.070 --> 03:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
have the capacity and there's
 
03:07:59.790 --> 03:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
no uh viability for an on-site septic
 
03:08:01.950 --> 03:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
system the expansion could not be
 
03:08:04.110 --> 03:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
undertaken is that correct represent M
 
03:08:06.150 --> 03:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
MC Williams
 
03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
I'm represent MC Williams can you clear
 
03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
this up for us please and then I'll call
 
03:08:12.670 --> 03:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
on the committee members that want to
 
03:08:16.269 --> 03:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
speak thank you for the question um so
 
03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
we discussed before the break that
 
03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
subject two on line nine related to
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer would mean
 
03:08:25.790 --> 03:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
that a property currently has Municipal
 
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer you are subject to for
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
the property you own you're connected um
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
so it's really a capacity question not a
 
03:08:35.229 --> 03:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
br bringing in new lines so the example
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
that uh R mcon brought up I believe was
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
that if you had a very rural site and
 
03:08:42.190 --> 03:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
you were trying to get the city or the
 
03:08:44.110 --> 03:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
town or whatever to connect a Mile's
 
03:08:46.469 --> 03:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
worth of pipe to you you could not use
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
section four to to demand that they
 
03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
would bring that to you because you are
 
03:08:51.510 --> 03:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
not currently subject
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
to does that clear this
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
up thank you it does get me closer one
 
03:09:01.349 --> 03:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
more scenario though what if a
 
03:09:04.349 --> 03:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
lot if if we're saying that subject to
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water means it's going by you
 
03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
street and what if your lot was not
 
03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
suitable after perking Etc or or or to
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
to or even large enough for um personal
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
septic and water for the duplex if the
 
03:09:26.190 --> 03:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
capacity is already Beyond on the uh on
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
the municipal end then still we have the
 
03:09:32.110 --> 03:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
10 years which to me would still be
 
03:09:33.750 --> 03:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
compelling to the town to make the
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
improvements to get that approval
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
there that would be in that situation
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
where you've purchased a lot and water
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
and sewer run by the lot but you're not
 
03:09:44.190 --> 03:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
currently connected because it's an
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
empty lot right so you've applied you
 
03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
want to put a duplex on that lot City
 
03:09:52.229 --> 03:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
responds no we have an engineering study
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
that says we cannot our capacity is not
 
03:09:56.670 --> 03:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
good enough 10year clock runs at the end
 
03:09:58.910 --> 03:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year clock under this bill it
 
03:10:00.990 --> 03:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
says all previously delayed Housing
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
Development projects must be allowed by
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
the municipality by right after the
 
03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
expiration of the term so you still get
 
03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
the hookup after 10 years but you're
 
03:10:11.150 --> 03:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
still subject to State requirements
 
03:10:13.469 --> 03:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the municipality says
 
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
so if there's a state reason for no
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
section D or last sentence of four then
 
03:10:20.349 --> 03:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
you still could get kicked out and not
 
03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
be able to so that is a piece of it and
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
yes in that example an empty lot that
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
has sewer and water running past you
 
03:10:28.229 --> 03:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
would have a 10-year clock from
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
application once you're
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
rejected I'll leave it at that okay
 
03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:34.990 align:start position:0%
rejected I'll leave it at that okay
representative

03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um representative MC
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
Williams um you can correct me if I'm
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
wrong but earlier I had understood you
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
to say that if at the end of 10 years um
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
there was still not sufficient capacity
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh for water and sewer for the proposed
 
03:10:56.590 --> 03:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
duplex and if it would not be possible
 
03:11:00.110 --> 03:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
to set up a private well or a uh private
 
03:11:03.790 --> 03:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh Waste Disposal system uh that uh it
 
03:11:06.229 --> 03:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
could be denied for another 10 years
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
that another 10year clock could
 
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
run so we talked about getting a second
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
engineering study which could indeed
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
trigger a second 10-year clock and and
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
would probably year nine when the this
 
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
municipality sees an uptick in
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
applications they would go get another
 
03:11:23.389 --> 03:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
study because the intent would be we
 
03:11:25.710 --> 03:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
need another 10-year delay I'm just
 
03:11:27.550 --> 03:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
talking about a hypothetical here
 
03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
ideally the municipality has figured out
 
03:11:31.309 --> 03:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
a solution to capacity issues but if
 
03:11:33.070 --> 03:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
they haven't this is one thing a
 
03:11:34.910 --> 03:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
municipality could do is get another
 
03:11:36.790 --> 03:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
engineering study which would cause that
 
03:11:39.389 --> 03:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
10-year delay for the next clock to run
 
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
from the first proposed Housing
 
03:11:43.229 --> 03:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
Development under the new engineering
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
study moving forward so it effectively
 
03:11:47.630 --> 03:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
cuts off any more applicants after the
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
new study so we talked about the
 
03:11:51.550 --> 03:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
administrative load where every time
 
03:11:53.309 --> 03:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
somebody tries to get a duplex and
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're told oh no we can't we have an
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
engineering study administratively I
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
suppose the municipality could be
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
getting new studies every year so they
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
have literal 10year clocks running from
 
03:12:08.830 --> 03:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
2024 to 2034 from 2025 to 2035 they
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
could do that it's just a cost and a
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
load on the municipality to keep
 
03:12:14.429 --> 03:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
delaying by 10 years these waves of
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
applicants so there are many ways this
 
03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
could play out out I think the intent
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
here is to at least put some teeth in it
 
03:12:24.670 --> 03:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
to at least show the municipality that
 
03:12:27.070 --> 03:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
the state is serious about allowing
 
03:12:29.150 --> 03:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
duplexes and that you have a 10-year
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
window but then you must allow all
 
03:12:32.910 --> 03:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
previously delayed under that 10-year
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
window by right there is still an
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
exception for the state issues so if
 
03:12:40.870 --> 03:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's a greater picture problem I'm
 
03:12:42.429 --> 03:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
I'm still seeing there may be an
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the municipality to
 
03:12:46.150 --> 03:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
reach out to the state and say review
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
our capacity where are we at this is
 
03:12:51.070 --> 03:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
this possible is this um not feasible
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
for us to upgrade our capacity and I
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
suppose as often happens here this could
 
03:12:58.750 --> 03:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
be subject to a court case where we
 
03:13:00.309 --> 03:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it was feasible
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the municipality to upgrade or not
 
03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
um I and I don't want to do that I don't
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to kick it to the courts I'd rather
 
03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
have good clear language um but this is
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
once again threading the needle trying
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
to find something that can meet both
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
getting those units that we need in
 
03:13:15.870 --> 03:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that don't currently have
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
the city water and sewer to to service
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
those properties and also making it very
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
clear that you can't keep kicking the
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
can for 10 20 30 years uh follow-up
 
03:13:29.670 --> 03:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
question um okay uh and I understand
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
certainly the desire not to keep kicking
 
03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
the can down the road but if at the end
 
03:13:35.910 --> 03:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the 10 years there were a new
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
engineering study which said that for
 
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it was still currently
 
03:13:45.229 --> 03:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
not feasible uh to provide water and
 
03:13:47.870 --> 03:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
sewer that would start another 10year
 
03:13:52.469 --> 03:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
clock and so the uh development still
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
could not go in as of right if in fact
 
03:13:57.309 --> 03:13:57.319 align:start position:0%
the water and sewer was not feasible at
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
that point the new clock could not the
 
03:14:01.469 --> 03:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
Old Clock
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
can okay but the under this but the
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
actual development okay I have a house
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
and I want to turn it into a
 
03:14:14.429 --> 03:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
duplex okay and I put in my application
 
03:14:17.510 --> 03:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the municipality says it's beond our
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
water and sewer capacity and they get
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
they get an engineering report that says
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
our current capacity will not provide
 
03:14:28.030 --> 03:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
for this so then we have a 10-year clock
 
03:14:31.550 --> 03:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason um the city has
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
not been able to resolve the
 
03:14:38.110 --> 03:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
problem I would think that they should
 
03:14:40.510 --> 03:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
be able to within 10 years but assuming
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
they had not been able to within 10
 
03:14:45.070 --> 03:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
years and they then get another
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
engineering study can can I then as of
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
right um put in my development or not if
 
03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
a new engineering study says it's not
 
03:14:57.309 --> 03:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
feasible we still don't have enough
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
capacity under the scenario that you
 
03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
have described you fall under the first
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
engineering study your clock started
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
well the clock started when the first
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
proposal under that engineering study
 
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
went in when those 10 years are up
 
03:15:12.590 --> 03:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to do your duplex even
 
03:15:14.349 --> 03:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
though it will increase capacity on the
 
03:15:16.030 --> 03:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
municipality that has already told you
 
03:15:18.349 --> 03:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
it can't your 10 years are up you're
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to but the new engineering study
 
03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:30.790 --> 03:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
applicants okay representative
 
03:15:33.309 --> 03:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
Walsh which
 
03:15:36.750 --> 03:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
line allows the municipality to create
 
03:15:41.550 --> 03:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.630 --> 03:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
study I guess there's nothing to stop
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
them in current law somewhere but I'm
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
just I guess my fear is well go ahead I
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
if you can answer that one nothing in
 
03:15:53.229 --> 03:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
this law prevents a municipality from
 
03:15:54.990 --> 03:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
getting an engineering study related to
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
capacity for sewer and water every year
 
03:15:59.590 --> 03:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
every six months however frequently that
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
municipality feels they need to do that
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this law that
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
prevents them from doing that thank you
 
03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:06.590 align:start position:0%
prevents them from doing that thank you
represent

03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:16:09.189 --> 03:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
V thank you I think that it would be
 
03:16:09.199 --> 03:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
V thank you I think that it would be
just

03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:16:14.309 --> 03:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
the the um the engineering study that
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
they are using to dis
 
03:16:20.110 --> 03:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
allow right if they're saying this
 
03:16:23.309 --> 03:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
engineering study
 
03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
um is the one that we I I'm I'm I think
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
that every single applicant from the
 
03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
first applicant to 10 years from that
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
first application would be covered under
 
03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:44.429 align:start position:0%
that um
first

03:16:44.429 --> 03:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh study study and that at 10 years and
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
one day they would be able to deny on
 
03:16:54.110 --> 03:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
upon that new study that they got let's
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
say in year nine but they wouldn't be
 
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
able to apply to people in year nine uh
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
because they are currently under the um
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
within the uh that 10-year window as far
 
03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
as um the because all previously delayed
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
housing projects essentially from that
 
03:17:17.469 --> 03:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
10-year window
 
03:17:21.309 --> 03:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
should be allowed and under the language
 
03:17:24.910 --> 03:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
in 11 and 12 and then at 10 years and
 
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
one day they could have a new
 
03:17:27.710 --> 03:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
engineering study that starts that 10e
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
clock again for those new
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
people do you see what I'm is that am I
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
reading read more I think you're reading
 
03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
more into it than what it says
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately or fortunately either way
 
03:17:40.590 --> 03:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
um I think you could argue it either way
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
03:17:45.189 --> 03:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
think you can have an engineering study
 
03:17:46.990 --> 03:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
dated let's just say the date it's
 
03:17:49.189 --> 03:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
today's date okay so it's the Ides of
 
03:17:52.910 --> 03:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
March 2024 we have an engineering study
 
03:17:55.870 --> 03:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
Monday someone applies to do a duplex
 
03:17:57.950 --> 03:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
they fall under that engineering study
 
03:17:59.790 --> 03:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
okay then next month on the first of the
 
03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
month we commission a new engineering
 
03:18:04.030 --> 03:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
study with a new date if there is a new
 
03:18:07.750 --> 03:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
applicant as of the second of um next
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
month then that new applicant falls
 
03:18:13.150 --> 03:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
under the new
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
study go ahead thank you I think you're
 
03:18:18.910 --> 03:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
reading into it than than than is there
 
03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
because I think that the the application
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
is all based on the
 
03:18:29.790 --> 03:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
um that
 
03:18:35.229 --> 03:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
the the 10 years is based on the um
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
first denial so if you got a in
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
engineering study today that says you
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any capacity and you didn't
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
get a request for 15 years and you got
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
and then you said hey uh or however long
 
03:18:54.910 --> 03:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
the study is is valid for let's say it's
 
03:18:57.269 --> 03:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
one day less than the the study is valid
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
for let's say in the hypothetical the
 
03:19:02.670 --> 03:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
study is valid for five years um or 10
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
years I I have no idea I've never seen
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
one of these studies so the day
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
before that that um that uh study is no
 
03:19:15.630 --> 03:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
longer valid you get an application you
 
03:19:17.469 --> 03:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
could deny based on that application
 
03:19:18.790 --> 03:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
even though it's 10 years old or
 
03:19:22.590 --> 03:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the case 9 and 364 days old you
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
could deny under that and it would be
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
denied for 10 years under this even
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
though now that study is no longer valid
 
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
because it is following 10 years after
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
the proposed Housing Development not 10
 
03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
years after the study it's 10 years
 
03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
after the denied propose um development
 
03:19:44.469 --> 03:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
so that would essentially grant them 20
 
03:19:46.349 --> 03:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
years even though their study is only
 
03:19:50.110 --> 03:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
good for 10 years and so um I think that
 
03:19:53.790 --> 03:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's all based on on this time frame ver
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh of the first proposed development and
 
03:19:57.670 --> 03:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
the second and the third and the fourth
 
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
and all the ones that that are in that
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
10 years are all denied automatically or
 
03:20:06.229 --> 03:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
disallowed by the municipality
 
03:20:08.429 --> 03:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
automatically is my reading of this
 
03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
language but you know that's so in the
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
real world you're going to have capacity
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
studies and you're going to have changes
 
03:20:17.469 --> 03:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
in capacity
 
03:20:19.630 --> 03:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
over the course of 10 years that's just
 
03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
how how this works is that there are
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the system roads get torn up
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
pipes get uh replaced resized so it's
 
03:20:30.189 --> 03:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
not stagnant it doesn't stay the same if
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
you were to commission another study the
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
data would be different because things
 
03:20:36.150 --> 03:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
are changing with our water and sewer
 
03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
where we have them and that data is
 
03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
constantly in flux so it doesn't stay
 
03:20:44.189 --> 03:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
the same for 10 years is my point your
 
03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
your data is no good if you were
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
challenging it after six years or asking
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
so increasing the capacity would not
 
03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily require a huge
 
03:21:09.229 --> 03:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
neighborhood-wide Capital project
 
03:21:13.189 --> 03:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
increasing capacity could result from uh
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
say the process of repairing some very
 
03:21:18.510 --> 03:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
old pipes and putting in some larger
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
pipes that conceivably could happen and
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
that would change the level of capacity
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
along that particular Street
 
03:21:29.189 --> 03:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay are we all set with
 
03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
representative MC
 
03:21:34.590 --> 03:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
Williams yes okay thank you all right so
 
03:21:36.229 --> 03:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
is there a discussion on this amendment
 
03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded is there
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
any discussion on
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
it represent Walsh just one and I'll
 
03:21:47.189 --> 03:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
keep it brief I know we uh were some are
 
03:21:48.670 --> 03:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
under a lot of pressure to come up with
 
03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
Solutions but I hope we're also in favor
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
of passing understandable law and with
 
03:21:56.950 --> 03:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
the 10 of us in this room we're still
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
probably not on agreement of what
 
03:22:00.750 --> 03:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
actually this does and nothing
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
argumentative but even the prime sponsor
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
says there are many ways this could play
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
out and this is all like threading a
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
needle so if we're going to start
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
imposing mandates on a municipalities I
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
would hope that the language we would be
 
03:22:14.950 --> 03:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
telling them what to do is a little
 
03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
clearer than this so for that I'm not
 
03:22:18.910 --> 03:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
going to be able to support this
 
03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:21.389 align:start position:0%
going to be able to support this
amendment

03:22:21.389 --> 03:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:22:24.750 --> 03:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else all right is the show
 
03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
of hands okay for the amendment all
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
right all those in favor of the
 
03:22:31.229 --> 03:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
amendment please raise your hand those
 
03:22:34.110 --> 03:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
opposed okay so it passes nine to one
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
nine to Bert nine to Bert shout out all
 
03:22:41.189 --> 03:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
right so now we're on the final a to
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
pass as amended with amendment number
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
1157 is that there any discussion on
 
03:22:47.359 --> 03:22:48.030 align:start position:0%
1157 is that there any discussion on
that

03:22:48.030 --> 03:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:50.990 --> 03:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
motion who's made that motion uh motion
 
03:22:53.429 --> 03:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
by representative yella and seconded by
 
03:22:53.439 --> 03:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
by representative yella and seconded by
representative

03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.309 --> 03:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
yes do you have something to say oh no I
 
03:23:07.950 --> 03:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
thought he was calling the role oh okay
 
03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
so with that the clerk will call the
 
03:23:12.510 --> 03:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
role uh Vice chair
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
barui Yes again representative makoni
 
03:23:19.189 --> 03:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative Walsh no clerk votes
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative yella yes
 
03:23:22.950 --> 03:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo yes
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Reed yes representative
 
03:23:28.269 --> 03:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
Gibbs yes representative
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
Damon yes last but not least chairman
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
Alexander Yes 91 measure passes all
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
right so I'm going to leave that on the
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
regular calendar as well as I think
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh made a good point
 
03:23:42.269 --> 03:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of explaining that we
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
so too yes we got some splaining too all
 
03:23:53.070 --> 03:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
right beautiful so that finishes up our
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
um house bills so um these will not be
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
on the calendar for next week I'm
 
03:23:59.229 --> 03:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
assuming they'll be on for the the 28th
 
03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
so I'll send around an email um there's
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
only two bills that we'll have on the
 
03:24:05.309 --> 03:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
regular calendar at this point but I'll
 
03:24:07.110 --> 03:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
send an email around who's responsible
 
03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
for What on the floor if uh any of these
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
are pulled off consent
 
03:24:16.110 --> 03:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
so with that I would like to get reports
 
03:24:16.120 --> 03:24:16.950 align:start position:0%
so with that I would like to get reports
by

03:24:16.950 --> 03:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
