00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
just a a piece of information before we
 
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
i read the chairman script for next
 
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
tuesday we are meeting
 
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to be starting until
 
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
10 30.
 
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is the senate of
 
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
course is doing their nine o'clock
 
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
hearing of our bills
 
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.510 align:start position:0%
hearing of our bills
and

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
there there's a real conflict there and
 
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
folks uh both parties are probably
 
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to testify
 
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that makes it very difficult when
 
00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
you're exacting on this side of the
 
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
ledger too so uh we're going to be
 
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 30. we only have a few
 
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
bills to exact that day so it should go
 
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
quickly and
 
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
most likely it should be out by noon ish
 
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
12 30 that day so with that i'm going to
 
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead and read the chairman script
 
00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have a little bit more
 
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
discussion in some of the
 
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.069 align:start position:0%
discussion in some of the
scheduling

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 align:start position:0%

work session on our behalf
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
trying to compile some uh facts and
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
information if we want to ship off to uh
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
division two i expect that meeting to go
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
much beyond probably 12 o'clock it's
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go from 10 to 12 but due to
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
the fact we need to get that
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh identified in the report and do it
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
as best we can i suspect it will go
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
maybe as we discussed yesterday in that
 
00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.390 align:start position:0%
maybe as we discussed yesterday in that
subcommittee

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
i indicated we could go at least
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
probably to two o'clock and i saw
 
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative miller shake and said yes
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%

uh sure mr very briefly uh this is
 
00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh sure mr very briefly uh this is
simply

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
to remove one line from our uh present
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
constitution the so-called blaine
 
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.510 align:start position:0%
constitution the so-called blaine
amendment

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
the recent supreme court case of
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
espinosa versus montana
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much supersedes and relegates
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
that in terms of it being cited in any
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
future legal action and again i just
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
would say it's a 19th century relic uh
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
some of us see it as a relic of the
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
more intolerant time and it's uh time to
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
look at it and and we think remove it
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's a ditto over there
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion from the committee
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
and uh represent cordelia did you have
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
your hand up yes uh thank you mr
 
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.389 align:start position:0%
your hand up yes uh thank you mr
chairman

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
chairman
uh

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think there are two reasons
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
that this uh
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
amendment or no aid amendment needs to
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
be removed from
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh our constitution i believe it's
 
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.070 align:start position:0%
uh our constitution i believe it's
sustained

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
sustained
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
on our historic constitution
 
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.230 align:start position:0%
on our historic constitution
um

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
first um as representative mentioned
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
the espinosa decision
 
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.710 align:start position:0%
the espinosa decision
clearly

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.509 align:start position:0%
clearly
finds

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
language such as this in state
 
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
language such as this in state
constitutions

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
constitutions
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative lag can you ask
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia to move closer
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
we got to move to mike thanks you got it
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
thanks glenn thank you
 
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.630 align:start position:0%
thanks glenn thank you
um

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
the blaine amendment or no eight
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
amendments in the state constitutions
 
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.550 align:start position:0%
amendments in the state constitutions
um

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
really uh have uh been
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
decided as unconstitutional by the
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
espinoza versus montana department of
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
revenue case
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
as we have heard uh the
 
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.110 align:start position:0%
as we have heard uh the
uh

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh being the first
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
reason it should be removed
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh the second reason is that it is
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
as representative said
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
a relic of anti-religious bigotry
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it went up into the 1920s
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um there was a
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
a reinvigoration of the anti-religious
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
and anti-jewish and anti-catholic school
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
movement uh
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
in the 1920s both in oregon and in maine
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
the ku klux klan was very active in
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
maine in the 1920s uh trying to
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
catholic schools in particular
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
in oregon
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
there was a law passed
 
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
there was a law passed
that

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
all students all
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh children had to be taught
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
by public school teachers
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh this was also actively uh supported
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
by the ku klux klan out there as a means
 
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.389 align:start position:0%
by the ku klux klan out there as a means
of

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
getting rid of catholic schools
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
that had sprung up
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
catholic migration from ireland and
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
supreme court uh
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
or the case went to the supreme court uh
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
because of the challenges of a military
 
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.590 align:start position:0%
because of the challenges of a military
school

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
and a um
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
an orphanage that taught students
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
there were exceptions in the law but
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
these schools were concerned about their
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
ability to continue
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
in operation
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the case went all the way to the
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
supreme court it became known as the uh
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
pierce the governor of oregon versus the
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
society of sisters
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
and i want to quote one
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
i think very important a couple of
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
sentences from that uh
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
court opinion
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
the fundamental theory of liberty upon
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
which all governments in this union
 
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
which all governments in this union
repose

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
repose
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
excludes any general power of the state
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
to standardize its children
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
by forcing them to accept instruction
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
from public
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
public teachers only
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
the child is not the mere creature of
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
those who nurture him and direct his
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
destiny have the right
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
coupled with the high duty to recognize
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
and prepare him for additional
 
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.790 align:start position:0%
and prepare him for additional
obligations

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think that that
 
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.990 align:start position:0%
i think that that
then

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
also comes into play with recent
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
court decisions u.s supreme court

lutheran and zealman
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
not to mention the espinoza case
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
in which
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
it has been found that
 
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.150 align:start position:0%
it has been found that
these

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
types of scholarship programs or
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
education programs where the money goes
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
to the parent to find the best education
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their child they're
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
not mere creatures of the state the
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
funds are controlled by the parent to
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
find the best educational opportunities
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
child and i think that very much played
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.629 align:start position:0%
into the
uh

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
espinosa decision that we have talked
 
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.069 align:start position:0%
espinosa decision that we have talked
about

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.110 align:start position:0%
about
and

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
court struck down the oregon
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
the montana blaine amendment which is
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
very similar to our uh blaine amendment
 
00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
very similar to our uh blaine amendment
uh

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
i think for both reasons the
 
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.750 align:start position:0%
i think for both reasons the
unconstitutionality

00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the history of religious bigotry
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the blaine amendment was uh based
 
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.870 align:start position:0%
that the blaine amendment was uh based
upon

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
are the two primary reasons that uh this
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
relic needs to be uh removed as a stain
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
on our constitution
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman very much
 
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman very much
representative

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
represented wood talk did you have your
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
i saw it thank you thank you
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative i did actually um you
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
know and i appreciate the comments by uh
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
president of cordelli as the prime
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill i do recall that i
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
think the vote was 46 to 236 against on
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
input from the public but beyond that i
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
was looking at the amended the amended
 
00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
was looking at the amended the amended
version

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh the analysis of the amended verizon
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
the last page of the
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
print out on my computer
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
talks about if the amendment is adopted
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
under the voter's guide
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
and it says this prohibition
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
will be removed and money raised by
 
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.949 align:start position:0%
will be removed and money raised by
taxation

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
should be granted or applied to the use
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
of school for religious sect or
 
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
of school for religious sect or
determination

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
so this if i understand this i
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
understand the plain amendment i
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
the that our constitution the new
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution as well are old
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh and been around for a long time it
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
takes a
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
humongous amount of work to change them
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh and not often change but this is a
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
radical change uh it's not just a blaine
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
amendment change this is saying that the
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
money we raise locally to pay for local
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
public education can now be forwarded
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
through this change in the literature to
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh private religious schools
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
i have no problem private religious
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
schools uh at all in fact they put out
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
some terrific uh youngsters that being
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
said i do have a
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
problem using public education money to
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
do that so i i understand where
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative cornell is coming from
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
the this is not just a simple caac
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
offering this is embedded in a lot more
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the overview of the uh
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
education act of the the fair school act
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
of trying to do the voucher act this is
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is just a small piece we're taking
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
a small piece here it's a much bigger
 
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.269 align:start position:0%
a small piece here it's a much bigger
picture

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
picture
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
so i think trying to ruse this into one
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
little one little line change is really
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
just generous
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
and i will be voting no thank you thank
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%

everything that that representative
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
woodcock just just said
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
um the issue is not religious education
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
the question is public funding and and
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money and um
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know in our constitution in 1784
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
well before there was discrimination
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
against catholics uh and irish people
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
coming into the united states
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
our founding fathers
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
wisely put in just as they did in the
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
that the united states should not be
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
a religious state
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
it should be there should be a
 
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.909 align:start position:0%
it should be there should be a
separation

00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
separation
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
of religion and government and that it
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
didn't in any way mean that you couldn't
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
go to religious schools
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
or have religious schools or
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
go have any religious
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
services that you wanted to or belong to
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
any it just meant that public funds
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
particularly excuse me particularly for
 
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.070 align:start position:0%
particularly excuse me particularly for
education

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
should not go
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
for religious training so um just want
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
to make that point thank you
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know this this is as
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock has said this is
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
just part of a grand plan
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
to try to get funds to uh religious
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
schools and this is unfortunate we've
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
heard this blane argument odd infinitum
 
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
heard this blane argument odd infinitum
here

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
what we have to realize is that the
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
blane amendment came into our
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
constitution in the mid 1800s
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
the issue of the separation of church
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
and state was from the beginning of this
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
country's founding
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
and what this does it basically is
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
contrary to the basic tenets of our
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
nation as it relates to make sure that
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's a separation between church and
 
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
there's a separation between church and
state

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill goes way beyond what is
 
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
this bill goes way beyond what is
necessary

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
frankly nobody is going to argue the
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
issue though there should not be uh
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
religious discrimination here whatever
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
the blane blame uh senator blaine's uh
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
motion was

this country
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
is based upon the separation of church
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
and state and this runs contrary to that
 
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.710 align:start position:0%
and state and this runs contrary to that
tenet

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%

i have a i have just a couple of things
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
to say first of all um with regards to
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
this being uh a discriminatory bill
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
against the irish i would like to on
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
this the 18th of march i might add uh
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
comment on the fact that
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh my grandparents were in fact irish
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
immigrants to this country and
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
where i am sitting in my basement is 2.2
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
miles from the parochial school that i
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
attended as a child
 
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.549 align:start position:0%
attended as a child
um

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that i heard many stories
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
growing up about
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
no irish need apply
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
but not once did i hear a complaint
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
coming from my grandparents nor my
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
parents after them about having to pay
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
for parochial education
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
because they felt it was part of their
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
religious expression and therefore a
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
also you know public education came
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
before the establishment of parochial
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
schools parochial schools came about as
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
a result of catholics wanting to
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
separate themselves from a school system
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
that they felt had become protestantized
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
i i i just think that referring to the
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state as a
 
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state as a
relic

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
relic
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
does not represent the viewpoints of the
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
constituents that i have heard from
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
in great number that are exceptionally
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
concerned over us using public monies
 
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.350 align:start position:0%
concerned over us using public monies
for

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
religious purposes
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh because of that i will be voting
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
against this
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative either further
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelia thank you um
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
on the subject of
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
i wish someone would point out that
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
praise to me in the constitution
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
there um let me quote from the majority
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
opinion in the trinity lutheran
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
supreme court case
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
denying the generally available benefits
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
solely on the account of religious
 
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
solely on the account of religious
identity

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
and poses a penalty on the pre-exercised
 
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
and poses a penalty on the pre-exercised
religion

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
religion
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
the exclusion of trinity lutheran from a
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
public benefit for which is otherwise
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
qualified solely because it is a church
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
is odious
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
odious to our constitution
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
we know
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
the ruling
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
in the espinoza case
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
which basically says that to
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
try and
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
use this
 
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
use this
amendment

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
as a reason
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
to exclude
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
funds to go to a religious school
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
if those funds can be used
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
to send children to a private school
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional it's a violation
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
as per the espionage decision it's a
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
violation of the establishment clause
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
of our constitution
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
simple as that
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's an invalid reason to
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
argue against this constitutional
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
amendment uh let me quote from justice
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
salido nbsp news in the espinoza case
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the program helped parents of modest
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
means do what more affluent parents can
 
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.630 align:start position:0%
means do what more affluent parents can
do

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
send their children to a school of their
 
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
send their children to a school of their
choice

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
issue is about and the reason to exclude
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
this we've had
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court justices testify
 
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.750 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
when there is a parental choice involved
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
of what school what services what
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
educational options are being used
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
then there is no violation
 
00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
then there is no violation
of

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in connecticut used to pay
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
their taxes to the congregational church
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to talk about
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
separation in church
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
what are tough public funds we talk

about public funds
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as public funds
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's taxpayer money
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's what public funds are so why not
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
let parents use some of their taxpayer
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
money that they've sent to the
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
government to find the best education
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
about funds being used for religious
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
schools are we talking
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying that these funds could be
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
used at any religious school correct
 
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
used at any religious school correct
uh

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not it was a
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
jewish community center a buddhist
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
school uh
 
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
school uh
a

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
christian school an islamic school uh
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the religious aspect is
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
school choice
 
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.430 align:start position:0%
school choice
or

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
even trinity lutheran wasn't a school of
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
choice issues but in school choice
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation where there is a choice of
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
what school what services the parents
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
want to use um that scholarship or
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
savings account money for
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
um yes it can be used for a variety of
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
purposes so it could be used for a
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
catholic school a jewish school
 
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.190 align:start position:0%
catholic school a jewish school
or

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
any kind of
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
educational services depending on what
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation says
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up mr chair
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
would there ever be a chance where a
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
religious school
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
so a school where students were in
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
attendance and parents were choosing to
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
send their children there uh was denied
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
has there been an instance of that is
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
is that a possibility is that is that
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
something that could happen or has it
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
happened in
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
other places
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
well in the espinoza case um yes the
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
department of revenue said you cannot
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
send your children
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
to um a in this that case uh mrs
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
espinoza wanted to send her or was
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
sending her children to um a christian
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
school and the department of revenue
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
said no you can't because we haven't
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with the case i'm just
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if you envision
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
it being um
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
open-ended enough that any established
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
religious school would be guaranteed of
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
getting uh
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
funds or if it had they had to go
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
through an approval process i don't
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
think that um there's a guarantee in
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
there i think it depends on the
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
legislation that you're looking at if
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a school choice
 
00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a school choice
um

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and in this case we
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
had 1820 or now 130s it says approved
 
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
had 1820 or now 130s it says approved
schools

00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
so they are approved by
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to add in a little bit
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
later on today we're going to be taking
 
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
later on today we're going to be taking
up

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
ab 282 which is dealing with the tuition
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
program that we have
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
for those school districts which don't
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
have particular traits in their in their
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
organizational structure but one of the
 
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
organizational structure but one of the
requirements

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that they must be in compliance with
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
the provisions of rsa 193 equal
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.310 align:start position:0%
the provisions of rsa 193 equal
b

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
and sections a and b within
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh which are those approval standards
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
that we're requiring so this is why uh
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's you'll see most of our language
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
saying private schools
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
rather than sectarian or non-sector
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
the effort here is to go strictly
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
private but you have to meet the
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
approval standards which are
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
applicable to that particular
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
organizational structure as set up by
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative tanner you have your hand
 
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.950 align:start position:0%
representative tanner you have your hand
up

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
is there still
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
a court case pending on this very issue
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and if so
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
should we
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
stick a constitutional amendment on the
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
ballot to interfere with the court case
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're directing that
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
question towards myself
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think that you know we should be
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not too concerned about that i'm i'm
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this there's always there's
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
always going to be some litigation
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
as there may be in regard even to 282 uh
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
wanting to send their students but this
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we have stipulates
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what we have to work off of
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
is that you must be in compliance with
 
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.710 align:start position:0%
is that you must be in compliance with
193e

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
193e
 
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.470 align:start position:0%
193e
um

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
so just just a question is the court
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
i i thought i heard what in testimony he
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
had earlier yes it is and they're hoping
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
that through this legislation
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
we may be able to you know stop that
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
dedication and stop these awful costs
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
that folks are
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
having to approve including the school
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
districts and the the person bringing
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
that litigation forward
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
so so this is an attempt
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
to put something in front of the court
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
before the court actually settles it
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
based on the constitution is that
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
correct i think that if you're looking
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
at the poll we're talking about cacr 3
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
not developed as consultant it was
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
developed as a result of the several
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
court cases trinity lutheran which uh of
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
missouri has since developed based upon
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
espinosa out in montana where the report
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
has come down our highest sports come
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
down and said it's
 
00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:13.990 align:start position:0%
down and said it's
unconstitutional

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
to you know to have these plain
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
amendments within constitutions they've
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
got to be eliminated i um mr chair i
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that both those
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
cases were fairly narrow in their
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
decision at the supreme court
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
the court case in new hampshire would be
 
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
the court case in new hampshire would be
important

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.630 align:start position:0%
important
to

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
still define
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
what exactly
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
comes down on i think some of those uh
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
statements were made in
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
in um by justices and dissent
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh or in
 
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.269 align:start position:0%
uh or in
in

00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
as part of the case but uh the case
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
itself in both espinoza
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the lutheran trinity lutheran
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
all right well i'll just put it i'm not
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
an attorney but i was at a meeting last
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
night we got off 11 o'clock and
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically we had one report from one
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
attorney in laconia we had another one
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
from folks down to hanover and they're
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
both opposite you know
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh reports so
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
i guess you can get an attorney to say
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
what you want them to say if
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
you're paying the dollar for it uh
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli you have uh
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.029 align:start position:0%
 
submitted

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
not because of any court case
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
um strictly because
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a stain on our
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh constitution because of its history
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
the espinosa case
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
basically has said
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
has ruled that
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know if you're using this as a basis
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
to exclude religious schools from a
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
program is unconstitutional
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.789 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
um

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
the margin of supreme court case
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh should be viewed as a reason to
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
exclude supreme court
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh or disregard supreme court cases i've
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
never heard that argument before whether
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
a case is truly a lutheran case
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
so should we
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
exclude that because it was not
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous i don't understand that
 
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.870 align:start position:0%
unanimous i don't understand that
argument

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
the supreme court is the supreme court
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the limitation that i think you're
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
will be works best when we get to a
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
later bill today um but
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
as we heard in the testimony from the
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
attorney in that case
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
they believe that
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
based on the espionage
 
00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.909 align:start position:0%
based on the espionage
ruling

00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional that excludes
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
religious schools from the town tuition
 
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.629 align:start position:0%
religious schools from the town tuition
program

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think
 
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.909 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think
that

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
supreme court case has anything to do
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
with this constitutional amendment
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
the constitutionalist amendment is being
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
offered because it is a relic of
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
anti-religious bigotry
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
and it's been decided by the supreme
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
court that it's unconstitutional
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
and we talked the other day about um
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
court cases in the future and costs to
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
the state well by leaving this in
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
the constitution is just going to invite
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:46.869 align:start position:0%
someone else
to

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
challenge some uh future legislation or
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
some existing legislation
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to come up with the same
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
arguments and we're going to
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to come down to the same
 
00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
we're going to come down to the same
facts

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
facts
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the u.s supreme court in the
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
espinosa case said that if you exclude
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's unconstitutional so you're going
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
to have all sorts of court cases and
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
possibly in the future and the same
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
outcome and the costs are going to be an
 
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
outcome and the costs are going to be an
issue

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
as we brought up the other day
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
represent like this you have your hand
 
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.829 align:start position:0%
represent like this you have your hand
up

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
um apparently
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
there have been through time many
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
schools teaching separation of church
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
and state separation of church and state
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
i hear it all the time there is no such
 
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.430 align:start position:0%
i hear it all the time there is no such
thing

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
in fact that would have been unheard of
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
by the people who founded our country
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
it specifically says childhood shall not
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
establish a particular
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
set or set of beliefs because most of
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
the people coming to our country early
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
on were coming to pursue religious
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
freedom so that they could
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
worship as they wanted to
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
so this whole idea of separation of
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
church and state is historically
 
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.150 align:start position:0%
church and state is historically
inaccurate

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
and it is in our constitution and
 
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.310 align:start position:0%
and it is in our constitution and
allowing

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
parents to choose a particular school
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
that happens to be religious and having
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
money that's allowed to go to other
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
private schools and not go to a
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
religious schools is very much against
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
what our founders intended and very
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh yeah briefly uh mr chair uh to follow
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
up on representatives comment
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh and to go back to uh i think
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative tanner alluded to the
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
1784 constitution uh
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
folks are continually conflating the
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
actual intent and the wording of the
 
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.790 align:start position:0%
actual intent and the wording of the
constitution

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
it simply said we will have no state
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
church it does not say that the state
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
and various
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
secular or non-secular
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
organizations cannot work together
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
along those lines on the micro level i i
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
was involved with running start um
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
and bishop brady is a catholic school
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
here in concord that had a partnership
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
with nhti where
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
small amounts of money and
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
and stuff were exchanged so we we have
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
here in concord uh a state institution
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
nhci partnering with a a catholic school
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
bishop brady already that's on a micro
 
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.270 align:start position:0%
bishop brady already that's on a micro
level

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i finally just want to point out
 
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
uh and i finally just want to point out
that

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.349 align:start position:0%
that
this

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.390 align:start position:0%
this
uh

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
church and state issue is is
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
something that folks who want to protect
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
a monopolistic uh establishment site
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of peculiar to america uh
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
canada freely supports uh religious
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
schools uh
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
all over west my relatives in denmark
 
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:05.109 align:start position:0%
all over west my relatives in denmark
where

00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
money freely goes to religious schools
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.829 align:start position:0%
money freely goes to religious schools
so

and back to the bigotry part of it in
boston

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
boston
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
they were clearly funding religious
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
schools in boston
 
00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.230 align:start position:0%
schools in boston
until

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
irish and italians started moving in
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
and they said well you're funding those
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
those schools why don't you fund hours
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that's when boston chains
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
and massachusetts changed their law
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
against giving money to religious
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
schools so it was clearly
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%

even in new hampshire and new england a
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the schools of small towns
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
were held in the local churches it was
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
the biggest building in town where you
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
can have the church have schools so
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
this whole bit about religious schools
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i've got a policy here
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
from uh goshen that
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
goes through this
 
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.349 align:start position:0%
goes through this
um

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'll quote from the uh language here
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
this ocean school board does not select
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
choice schools
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire public school would be
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
a choice option as long as the school
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
district of police led to a contract
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
with the goshen district
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
so that is clearly the
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
way things operate in
 
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.109 align:start position:0%
way things operate in
districts

00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
he basis for this
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
is to
strike

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.270 align:start position:0%

the

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%

statute that
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
applies to only
 
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.910 align:start position:0%
applies to only
non-sectarian

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
private schools being allowed
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
town tuition
 
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.670 align:start position:0%
town tuition
school

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll point out that uh back in 2016
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh there was house bill 1637
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
offered by representative bone
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
um that was vetoed by governor hassan
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
and her specific reason
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the veto message was that it was a
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
violation of our constitution's blame
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
amendment but we now know
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
reason for vetoing the program is
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional based on the espionage
 
00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:20.630 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional based on the espionage
decision

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
decision
uh

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh i think i'll leave it there
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions as we go as a presentation
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
reverend cordelie um glenn could you go
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
to la i'm on the amendment could you go
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
you there glenn
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay so on line three it says
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
on line three it says
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
if there is no public school for the
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
child's grade in the district so
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
specifically this bill
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
is only if there's no public school
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
grade in the district is that accurate
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay and on line eight
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
you you have eliminated the school board
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
may decide on line six
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
but on line eight it says the school
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
district so i don't know who that is
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
down the line on line eight it doesn't
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
identify who actually is doing the
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
voting then because before it was always
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think you can
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh infer that the school district
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
is represented by the
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
and they are the ones that do the
 
00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.190 align:start position:0%
and they are the ones that do the
contract

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
follow up mr cheer i would i wouldn't do
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
that at all as small schools with the
 
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
that at all as small schools with the
principal

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
principal
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh often negotiates or talks to other
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
schools and other programs so and we've
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
had other other situations all over the
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
place where this the principal that
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
makes the decision but this is not clear
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
this is just a school district who that
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the school secretary and moderator i
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
think i think that's not clear since you
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
specifically took the school board out
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
to that um
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the amended language
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
which modifies a small part of the
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
tuition program
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
and if you look in the original bill in
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
a different section section
 
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.670 align:start position:0%
a different section section
seven

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
it says be a school approved and
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
contracted by a local public school
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
board to provide students with the
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that reference references back to
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
which has all those subjects and
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
criteria that are for substantive
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
education adequate education
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
so it does require the school to be
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
approved by the school board
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
you mean the
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
when you just the clarification
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
represent lead i'm not talking about the
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
school specifically that the youngster
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
is going to i'm talking about who has
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
the authority to send it to them as of
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
line eight on the amendment
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not suggesting it's not an approved
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
school that's perfectly fine
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually the bill makes sense but i i
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand who the school district
 
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.549 align:start position:0%
don't understand who the school district
is

00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of that assignment that's all
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know a smaller school that that
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
often the the uh someone in charge of
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
special ed or someone in charge of uh
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
bilingual or whoever happens to be will
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
say that's the way we're going to go i
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
used to you took school board out is
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
this is the sending group that's all
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's just i think that's an error
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
because we can't clarify the school
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
district is but i understand though
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yeah i like to clarify that
 
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.190 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yeah i like to clarify that
because

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
the school district are the voters in
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
the town and they approve the budget the
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
school board submits the budget the
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
school board says and we want to send x
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
number of school students to this school
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the budget
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
and this was one of my arguments when i
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
first brought up the croydon bill
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
so yes the school board to improve but
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
meaning the voters in that district have
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
to approve the budget
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
and in that budget it will state that
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
just like any other budget
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
the representative line the school the
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
school the school budget and it doesn't
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
tell and the voters did not tell
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
the school who to assign where it does
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
not give authority for that it doesn't
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
identify student exporting this school
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
that school where a future may came up
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
during the school year representative
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
bowen if you have a youngster in that
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
school and make that placement that's
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
not the school voters
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
so it goes doesn't doesn't identify who
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
makes the decision that's all it
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
identified before the board and and this
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
amendment takes it out
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
that girls are what i think brexit
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 25 through 30
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
and the bill has
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
clearly states
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
tanner

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for recognize me um
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just read from our
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
constitution again
 
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.230 align:start position:0%
constitution again
um

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.270 align:start position:0%
um
in

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
article 6
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
it says but no person shall be compelled
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
to pay towards the support of the
 
00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:41.349 align:start position:0%
to pay towards the support of the
schools

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
of any sect or denomination
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
and just before that particular line
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
it talks about how religious
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
societies have the right to elect their
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
own teachers
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
and contracting with them for the
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
support of maintenance of schools or
 
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
support of maintenance of schools or
both

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:51:57.359 --> 00:51:58.790 align:start position:0%
both
so

00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
this was the this was in
 
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.190 align:start position:0%
this was the this was in
1784

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
1784
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh well before we had discrimination
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
against catholics
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
that keeps coming up with the blaine
 
00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.190 align:start position:0%
that keeps coming up with the blaine
amendment

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
and it was a it was a direct
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
article of our constitution
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
that's one thing i'd like to bring up
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
the second thing i'd like to bring up is
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
that this particular
 
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.710 align:start position:0%
that this particular
bill

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
rsa

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
that is being taken to court i mean we
 
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
that is being taken to court i mean we
are

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
with the cacr
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
i was uh alluding to the fact that we're
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
interfering with court decisions and and
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
court proceedings with this bill
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're actually taking
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
the bill the rsa
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
that parents are taking to court and is

presently under litigation
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
to change this particular language in
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
and we're voting on to change it here
 
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.309 align:start position:0%
and we're voting on to change it here
we're

00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand how
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
we feel it's uh prudent
 
00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
we feel it's uh prudent
or

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do to interfere with
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
litigation the other
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
types of um
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
judicial review
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
in espinosa and trinity lutheran were
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
very narrow and they dealt with money
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
that was not directly from taxpayers
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
this money in this bill where
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
a school board
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
a publicly elected school board using
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
public funding raised through taxation
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the town as well as state money that
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
comes down with adequacy and federal
 
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.710 align:start position:0%
comes down with adequacy and federal
funds

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
is sending it as you're you're saying
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
can send it to a religious school
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
i think it violates our constitution and
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think it would violate the u.s
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
constitution when it came down to
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
this particular narrow question thank
 
00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.069 align:start position:0%
this particular narrow question thank
you

00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:54:09.839 --> 00:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
ellison

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
ellison
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair a question to you
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
i guess
uh

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
i have questions about i don't have the
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me unfortunately
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
but lines 27 28 in the original bill
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh if they talk about complying with
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
statutes and regulations relating to
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
agency approval such as health fire
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
safety and sanitation uh i'm happy to
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
raise my questions about that when we
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
get to the the bill itself or
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
is part of this discussion about the
 
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:40.789 align:start position:0%
is part of this discussion about the
amendment

00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
suppose she references
 
00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:45.030 align:start position:0%
suppose she references
law

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i i am assuming my question
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
at this point is in order
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
well i would assume that right now that
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
i we're looking at the amendment yes
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
that that crazy allergy there okay thank
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.270 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
uh

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
it talks there and this is line 27 and
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
28 of the original
 
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
28 of the original
about

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
statutes and regulations such as health
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
fire safety and sanitation
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
which i assume would mean that a school
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
in school that was identified by a
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
school board as being a place to put
 
00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:22.549 align:start position:0%
school board as being a place to put
students

00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.670 align:start position:0%
students
would

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
qualify under those particular
 
00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:28.069 align:start position:0%
qualify under those particular
requirements

00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
is there a similar
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirement intent
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
that the schools that might be approved
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
would also
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
not discriminate against anyone
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
the of course the lines you're speaking
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
to right now you're talking about lines
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
27 and 28.
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
those that that language is currently in
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
law this was passed when we set up the
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
school tuition program several years
 
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.630 align:start position:0%
school tuition program several years
back

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
and that was set up just to ensure that
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
the schools melt the net the codes and
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
the education rules set up for those
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
particular three categories that are
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
also that's also implicitly in law
 
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.030 align:start position:0%
also that's also implicitly in law
so

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
now you're jumping to another topic of
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination which this bill doesn't
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
speak to it speaks to
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh changing non-sectarian and private
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
and it also uh would be language which
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see on lines 29 and 30 and then
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that is what this
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
bill speaks to
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.030 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
yes

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh then my question would be under the
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and the
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
would school districts be allowed to
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
contract with an organizational school
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
which discriminates against students
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
based on sexual orientation
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
school districts have to follow law and
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
they also have to uh make that decision
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
because this is made not by the state
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
board of education it's made by the
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
local board of education when they're
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with these contracts so
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
when when uh
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
when those
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
local school board members take their
 
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.589 align:start position:0%
local school board members take their
oath

00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
oath
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
when they do that they also at that time
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
are taking a hold to
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
follow all the laws rules of our state
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that even with the
 
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.190 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that even with the
narrow

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
if you're just looking at the narrow
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation of um espinoza versus
 
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.630 align:start position:0%
interpretation of um espinoza versus
montana

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
montana
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
this falls into that narrow
 
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.710 align:start position:0%
this falls into that narrow
interpretation

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
where there is choice
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
town is choosing amongst private
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
neighboring public schools and excluding
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
specifically what
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
the supreme court was ruling against
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
if there is a choice
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that choice includes other private
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
exclude religious schools because that
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh it's come up a couple of
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
a couple times today that there are some
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
court cases pending and that we need to
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
be uh aware
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
or even perhaps defer to these uh court
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
cases that are pending and i just want
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
to say the judicial process and the
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislative processes are totally
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
separate and that should not impact how
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
we do business that there's a court case
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
or court cases pending uh for example
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
last term you know we have somebody in
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
death row and the legislature
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know passed a death penalty statute
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to point out
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
the legislative process should not stop
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:21.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
just uh back to the discussion uh
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
earlier about uh
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
our article six of the constitution
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as the compelled
 
00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.829 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as the compelled
reason

00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:38.549 align:start position:0%
reason
clause

00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'd say that
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
we are not compelling someone to support
 
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.829 align:start position:0%
we are not compelling someone to support
religious

00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
religious
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
supporting with the town's wishing
 
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.430 align:start position:0%
supporting with the town's wishing
program

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
the students
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
of that town who do not have a grade
 
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.630 align:start position:0%
of that town who do not have a grade
level

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
to attend
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
they have to be sent according to state
 
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.910 align:start position:0%
they have to be sent according to state
law

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
to a school
 
01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
to a school
for

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
their education
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
we are complying with that
 
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.829 align:start position:0%
we are complying with that
um

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
provision of state law
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
has clearly stated in the uh
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
glitch in the bill that you're
 
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
glitch in the bill that you're
discussing

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh states that the school board will
 
01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:26.230 align:start position:0%
uh states that the school board will
just

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
decide on
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
what schools to contract with
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
and so i
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
01:00:34.319 --> 01:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
we are not
compelling

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
compelling
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh support of any
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
particular religious school to the
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
exclusion of other schools
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't see that that argument
 
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.549 align:start position:0%
don't see that that argument
plays

01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
plays
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
in relation to this legislation
 
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.789 align:start position:0%
in relation to this legislation
and

01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.390 align:start position:0%
and
again

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
if we leave language
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
not passing this bill
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
that court case will proceed
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
because it is clearly unconstitutional
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
based on the espionage case and you'll
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
just be inviting additional court cases
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh maybe someone in goshen will next
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
file a suit
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know if you want to uh open
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
it up to more uh
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
court cases uh fine but we can uh comply
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh supreme court ruling in the
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
espinosa case
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
make this religiously neutral in our
 
01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:41.430 align:start position:0%
make this religiously neutral in our
statutes

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%

during the hearing we realized that this
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
bill does require money
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
from the state and there's no financial
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
note deadlines for

thank you representative
ladd

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
ladd
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's been much discussion on this
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill and on the amendment
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
which is basically the same except
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
allows parents into the discussion
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the money issue came up before and
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
we heard the money issue from the
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
the uh department
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh that they regularly they regularly
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
update their programs every single year
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
we heard the money issue that there
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a 28a
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
because the local school systems who
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
have contracts are in the contract if
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's a law we've heard that the smaller
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
school systems already using it already
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
made workarounds so it's not really a
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
money issue at all
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
what it is is a
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
parent choice issue to allow students to
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
be recognized allow students to be
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh receive less bullying to have more
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
self-confidence and to allow school
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
staff and faculty to be able to identify
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
and work with these youngsters
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
just today
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
just this morning we heard again
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
from a representative who's sitting in
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
the lob we got to think about parent
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
choice and from another representative
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
the lob we heard it's time to get out of
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
the 20th century and get into the 21st
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
century this was just 10 minutes ago
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
so you can't have it both ways this is a
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
very simple bill that allows parents to
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
make the decision on their children uh
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
on on what they want to declare and
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
particularly those youngsters who are
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
non-binary and that that is a pretty
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
simple change in the in the uh
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislative process so i would urge you
 
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
legislative process so i would urge you
to

01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
decide to stop speaking out of both
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
sides of your mouth and take a stand one
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
way the other to stick with those things
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
and vote i 136 and allow parents to help
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
kids to get in school to be recognized
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
the correct way that they are
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.189 align:start position:0%

representative woodcock you know we
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
talked just talked a minute ago about
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
not discriminating from a religious
 
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.709 align:start position:0%
not discriminating from a religious
standpoint

01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about not allowing
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
parents to represent their student
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
i mean where is the consistency here
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
as you begin to look at the issue of
 
01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.709 align:start position:0%
as you begin to look at the issue of
discrimination

01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.870 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair
uh

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know this bill is
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand not putting in into
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
effect is very dangerous
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
we know that transgender students
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
are probably the biggest target for
 
01:10:31.679 --> 01:10:33.189 align:start position:0%
are probably the biggest target for
bullying

01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh harassment
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
um you know just just being teased i
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
mean being discriminated against
 
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
mean being discriminated against
excluded

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
you name it
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
and by making this one small change
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
which we have already done on
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
to make their lives and their parents
 
01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
to make their lives and their parents
lives

01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
just a little bit easier
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
so that they can go to school
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
and they can go into a classroom where a
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
new teacher is teaching
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
and looks at the roster
 
01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.790 align:start position:0%
and looks at the roster
and

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
makes the proper pronoun
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
i mean it's as silly it's as easy as
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what we're asking to
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
do in this bill
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
lives of kids
 
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.830 align:start position:0%
lives of kids
and

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
and
parents

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
less complicated
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
less dangerous
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
and and to make the schools
 
01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.270 align:start position:0%
and and to make the schools
non-discriminatory

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
this i can't believe
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
how we're having bills this year that
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
are what i call mean-spirited
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
because these people are doing nothing
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.910 align:start position:0%
because these people are doing nothing
wrong

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
they just want to be recognized
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
for who
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i would urge
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
people that have the least bit of
 
01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.390 align:start position:0%
people that have the least bit of
conscience

01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
to vote against this itl
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes i totally agree with the previous
 
01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.189 align:start position:0%
yes i totally agree with the previous
speakers

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
as a former teacher
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
um i i know what it's like because even
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
back when i was teaching there were kids
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
transgender or different
 
01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.550 align:start position:0%
transgender or different
than

01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
it was difficult
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
and and if you accidentally called that
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
person a girl or a boy
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
there was a sense of
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
embarrassment for the child and yourself
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
i think that it is
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
it is just a matter of a couple of
 
01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.950 align:start position:0%
it is just a matter of a couple of
columns

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
columns
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
on a computer they update their their
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
records constantly
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
at it at the state level at the city
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
level there's always something new that
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
has to be added this is not
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
a major
 
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.830 align:start position:0%
a major
issue

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's a simple thing they did it like
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative jackson you get it at the
 
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.550 align:start position:0%
representative jackson you get it at the
stake

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
stake
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the driver's licenses
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why it can't be done
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the school
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
and it it
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of morality it's a matter
 
01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.709 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of morality it's a matter
of

01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
of
um

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
um
not

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
singling out
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
um students
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's inclusiveness it's all the things
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
support and education
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
and and i
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
i cannot understand why
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
we can't support something like this
 
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
we can't support something like this
anything

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
that helps kids to maintain their
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
self-esteem and and and their self-worth
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
believe in this 100
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and and uh i will be voting definitely
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%

01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you sir i'd like to make a motion
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes i i just want to refer back to
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
the representative from manchester's
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
comments which i uh i took to heart and
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh there are a lot of points i think
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to discuss further there's
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
a financial component
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
there are some other comments that uh
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps should be made as well as we
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay representation uh thank you very
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
much uh i would like to point to some of
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
the other discussions that we've had uh
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
we would have the issue if we only
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
change the record of the sex or gender
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
to represent the way that the student
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
wants to be identified because we may
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
have a menstruating student who
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
identifies as male and if this is a
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
single notation in that column you might
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
have a substitute that doesn't
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
understand why john needs to go to the
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
nurse's office because john's claiming
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
that he has this period we have larger
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
issues to look to here and i want to
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are respecting that
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
individuality of students
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
we need to understand exactly how this
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be done in the software and make
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
sure that there's consistency so that so
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't become even more
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
confusing and i believe that between
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that and looking to any cost of either
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
adding a line or how to have some
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
standardized procedures in order to
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
reflect these student preferences i
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
think would better honor their
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
individual individual identities and
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
help reduce potentially embarrassing
 
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.350 align:start position:0%
help reduce potentially embarrassing
confusion

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock do you have your hand
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
up yeah thank you
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
president ladd a couple quick things
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
just to clarify for representative leon
 
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
just to clarify for representative leon
um

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
typically when students ask to go to the
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
nurse's office you say yes uh rarely do
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
you say no just because of the legal
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
implications and also the fact that the
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
student has to go to the nurse's office
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's not a consideration
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think the uh
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
people who teach know that uh in the
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
software the software product uh
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
costs you know we've already gone over
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
that i talked about that before the
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
state does it every single year when
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
they update the grades and when we heard
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
the education department speak at the
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
hearing they said that a normal piece is
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
they would have to send out training and
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
do if there was any complications so it
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
would all be unified so that and many
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
schools already do that and i want to go
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
back to quickly the the part that that
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
we talked about initially this is the
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
second time we've had this bill in in
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
two years uh and it's all the same it's
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
a student interest bill it's parents
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
trying to help kids every time if you
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
have school kids in public school every
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
time you go to register youngster and
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
particularly when you change buildings
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a aggravation and hassle
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the parents to get their youngsters
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
set up the way they're supposed to be
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
unless they have a very understanding
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
school system
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
and then when the youngster goes to
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
class it gets the wrong name the wrong
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
pronoun and all the stats that we've
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
just talked about and heard about the
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
negative impact on youngsters i mean in
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
my amendment uh which doesn't come up in
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
the retain obviously talks about
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
allowing parent choice in there uh to
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
add into that piece we've and i don't
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
understand how you can keep on pushing
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
like the board pushes parent choice and
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
anti-bullying and anti-discrimination
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then keep on voting back this
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more simple than this
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the school to put the correct
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
name on the correct list so a youngster
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
did not get embarrassed the youngsters
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
did not get uh their further their
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
psyche uh feeling really bad about
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and get more and more
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
negatives i mean look at the number of
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
kids in public school that cut for a
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
host of reasons
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
and have all kinds of
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
ideations this this just plays right
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
into it all we're doing is creating more
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
damage more danger for kids
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ford
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
i spent a good deal of yesterday talking
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
with my uh constituents as well as with
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
medical people i have contacts with and
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're pretty unanimous on this this
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
issue is bigger than just the child
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
being embarrassed the issue is one of
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
possible crucial diagnosis should a
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
child show up doubled over
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
and difficult to diagnose what's wrong
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
with them if they don't know what the
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
the birth biology of the child is from
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the start
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
and they need to have that unambiguous
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
both pieces of information
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
the issue does arise in some schools
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
where it's difficult to get find a place
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
to put that
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
but i kept thinking my gosh if you had
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
an old apple 2e you could put that
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
information on that for the nurse to
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
access but that's my own simplistic
 
01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:14.629 align:start position:0%
access but that's my own simplistic
solution

01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
the idea is that that's a problem that
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
just needs to be worked out and we need
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
to work out how to put it in a bill like
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
this but the the reality is according to
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
the people who have to deal with this is
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
they need both pieces of information and
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
they need it immediately as soon as the
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
child presents themselves with possibly
 
01:31:34.159 --> 01:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
child presents themselves with possibly
uh

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
being you know seriously ill
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
appendicitis comes to mind things like
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
that or if someone has a bad
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
period in terms of pain and pressure and
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
bleeding and all or if just some other
 
01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.990 align:start position:0%
bleeding and all or if just some other
complication

01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
complication
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
miscarriage is there they need to know
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
right then what they're confronting not
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
minutes later after you've looked it up
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
in a file somewhere
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's my point thank you representative
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um and i appreciate the fact
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
that my colleagues
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
on the education committee
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
are starting to think
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh and and ask themselves the questions
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
about about this bill and bills like
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
this about transgender students
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill is just as bad as i
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
telling it in my my opinion
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
um in my 35 years teaching
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think six different students take
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
their lives suicide
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
for various reasons not obviously not
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
all of them or transgender or maybe any
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:32:45.679 --> 01:32:46.709 align:start position:0%
of them
but

01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
to have a young person take their own
 
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.390 align:start position:0%
to have a young person take their own
life

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.189 align:start position:0%
life
is

01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
affects not only the family the school
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible terrible thing to to go
 
01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible terrible thing to to go
through

01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
through
if

01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
if
one

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
we save one student
 
01:33:06.239 --> 01:33:07.350 align:start position:0%
we save one student
now

01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill rather than
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
retaining it
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's worth the 20 000 or whatever
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
that people put in in as a stop gap on
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
why we can't pass this bill
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
will make the difference
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
a tremendous difference
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
in the lives of a few students we're not
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of students we're
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a few students
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you that as working hand
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
in hand with school nurses
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
they know who's transgender and who's
 
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.510 align:start position:0%
they know who's transgender and who's
not

01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
they know
 
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.910 align:start position:0%
they know
who's

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
because they're looking out for them
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
just like a lot of the other teachers
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
are looking out for them because they
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
are targets
 
01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.629 align:start position:0%
are targets
and

01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
it isn't a it isn't a medical problem
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
within a school
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
that the school personnel know exactly
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
this is for the kids
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is for their parents
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is for people who come into the
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
school as substitutes or maybe work in
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
today's kids don't have names like
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
mary jane and johnny jo
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
they they have names like maybe green
 
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.709 align:start position:0%
they they have names like maybe green
and

01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's gender neutral right from the
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
beginning or or like my dog raven you
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
know who knows right
 
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.910 align:start position:0%
know who knows right
um

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
this would be something that like i said
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
would make
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
a tremendous difference retaining it is
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
just going to push it down the road
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
give us another
 
01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.470 align:start position:0%
give us another
year

01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
where students are miserable are bullied
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
people are cruel to them
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
for no particular reason other than
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
they're trying to be who they think they
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
are okay that's all it is
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
and it they don't hurt anybody else
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
they don't hurt the classroom
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
you know this is such a mean-spirited
 
01:35:10.639 --> 01:35:11.830 align:start position:0%
you know this is such a mean-spirited
uh

01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
bill to itl or retain i mean it's it's
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
just the bill is not mean-spirited the
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
the fact of retaining it or itlling it
 
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.070 align:start position:0%
the fact of retaining it or itlling it
is

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
that i just i implore you
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
to take away the retain
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
put in a ought to pass and let's get
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
this bill and get this change on the
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
road thank you
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
leon uh thank you mr chair uh
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative tanner i'm not sure if
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
you recall but when we were talking
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
about the private rate of action we were
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about transgender children who
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
have died because of bullying issues so
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
we do take transgender issues seriously
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
here in this committee on both sides of
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
the aisle
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate that there are many
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
students who feel comfortable sharing
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
with the school nurse that they do have
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
a different biology than their express
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
gender identity however as this becomes
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
more prevalent there are students that
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
are transferring from school to school
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
someone who presents as a young man who
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
has transferred into school and now is
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
identified by his by his preferred
 
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.390 align:start position:0%
identified by his by his preferred
gender

01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
gender
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
and presents in pain
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
suffering from a ruptured ectopic
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and if he does not have that
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
established relationship with that
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
school nurse that school nurse may not
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
be looking for a ruptured ectopic
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and we could be looking at the
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
death of a transgender child because
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't reflected the full
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
identity of that child both their
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
biology and their preference and that
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
could cost that child or life if we're
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
talking about if it saves just one child
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to put in a solution that
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
serves us today when children are
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
transitioning in their current schools
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
and ignores those who have moved into a
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
school district or have
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
changed grade levels into a new building
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
and nobody knows them as their
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
biological gender they only know them as
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
their their gender profits
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and this could put lives at risk we need
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
to look at this as more than just one
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
line we need to look at this as
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
biological gender and also look at that
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
expressed interest right now there are
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
schools that we've heard are putting
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
this in the notes line that helps but
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps what we need is one where we can
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
identify birth gender and express gender
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then that can respect if that can
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
respect children all along the spectrum
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we don't lose a
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
child to a ruptured
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or some other
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
gender-based biologically based health
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue that needs immediate
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
identification i understand it's pushing
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
you one more year we have the notes
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
column and but as you said if it could
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent uh like
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes i was going to say many of the same
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
things that representative land
 
01:37:59.199 --> 01:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
things that representative land
said

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
said
um

01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the bill as written will do
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
what you want it to do
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
i think you need to look at a better way
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
to write it
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
biological gender for health reasons
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
and put in the
 
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
and put in the
preferred

01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
preferred
 
01:38:27.119 --> 01:38:30.310 align:start position:0%
preferred
gender

01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
because a legal name is going to be very
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
important at the hospital or various
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
other places they're going to need that
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
legal name for health insurance and
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
various other things and so
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
having a place where
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
a note that the parent will include that
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
says this is what
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
my child prefers to be called
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
this is um what pronouns my child
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
prefers i think there needs to be more
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
than than what is in this i think we
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
need to expand this i think it's a great
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
idea we need to expand it
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
and if we have that notes line
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
that can go for not just transgender
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
children that can go for special needs
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
children we can have those notes that a
 
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
children we can have those notes that a
sub

01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
sub
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
or somebody else needs to know
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
about a child so that they don't
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
embarrass the child
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
or themselves
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
by referring to the child a different
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
way because don't forget we don't just
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
have trans
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have non-binary and so
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
how are you going to put in one in a
 
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.149 align:start position:0%
how are you going to put in one in a
column

01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
column
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
how a non-binary student wants to be
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
referred to so i think we need to expand
 
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.149 align:start position:0%
referred to so i think we need to expand
this

01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can still keep the legal name
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
the biological sex
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
for health and safety reasons as well as
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
the preferred name the preferred gender
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
the preferred pronouns
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
and any other things that a sub
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
or a
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
medical doctor or whoever is going to be
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
interacting with that child
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the parent wants them to know about
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
that that will help them with
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
interacting and respecting that child
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you rexella mullen
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for recognizing me
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh as many of you know i'm a school
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
counselor by profession so i've lived
 
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.669 align:start position:0%
counselor by profession so i've lived
this

01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i i think that
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
allowing a parent to choose non-binary
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i want to draw back the attention to
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that this bill came to life as
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
a result of a request
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
by constituents parents of transgendered
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
and or non-binary children who asked for
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to reflect what they
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
feel is accuracy and honesty in
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
identifying their the gender identity of
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
their child uh we're still talking about
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
children if they need medical care go to
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
a hospital or have to
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
produce a name or whatever for uh
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
insurance purposes there's they're going
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
to require a parent to do that anyhow
 
01:41:10.239 --> 01:41:11.109 align:start position:0%
to require a parent to do that anyhow
so

01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
i look forward to the day where if uh
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
medical people or an administrator or a
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
teacher looks at a student record that
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
has non-binary checked off that they
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
immediately think outside the box and
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
think about whether or not they have to
 
01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.629 align:start position:0%
think about whether or not they have to
make

01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments in
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
medical assessment or care
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to the day when a
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't feel that they have to be
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
dishonest in their own mind about the
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
gender of their child
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to the day when we're
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
not asking parents of non-binary or
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
transgendered children to provide
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
information on their ch on their
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
children that we're not asking for on
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative shaw
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative mullen
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me
 
01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.310 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me
that

01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
is just a legislative uh directive
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
which allows
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh the third column or whatever you want
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
to call it
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
and that the student records
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
are probably much more detailed and they
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
probably do include a lot of this now
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
records are confidential
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
and they can't be released to everyone
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
so by just seeing
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
that there is a
um

01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.870 align:start position:0%
an additional
uh

01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
column if you want to call it or
 
01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:43.350 align:start position:0%
column if you want to call it or
whatever

01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh for that child then the records can
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
be divulged into
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know but by making more of this
 
01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
uh you know but by making more of this
bill

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill as it stands right now gives
 
01:42:58.400 --> 01:42:59.350 align:start position:0%
this bill as it stands right now gives
the

01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
open door or the policy or whatever to
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
the districts to go forward
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
what they're probably already doing
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
in silence and doesn't show up
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh in in ordinary so that
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's obvious there's more to this and
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
they need to develop into the records i
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking at it right but i think
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
this bill as it stands
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
is perfect should just move forward
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
and then all the rest of this is local
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
control it's local
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
schools it's individual schools it's
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
parents and individual schools
 
01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:41.910 align:start position:0%
parents and individual schools
it's

01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
not just a one size fits all a week you
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
know we can write a bill that's 14 pages
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
long and it's still not going to cover
 
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.550 align:start position:0%
long and it's still not going to cover
everything

01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
this is like a basic
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
let's move forward
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
x y and z can be done
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you uh representative
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
shaw that there are authorized users in
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
schools that have access to student
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
records that do not allow for
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
just anyone in a school building to
 
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.629 align:start position:0%
just anyone in a school building to
access

01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
confidential information and i also
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you that this is a clerical
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
piece of information
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would just like
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
to point out that um i think maybe
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
there's been some
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of the
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um in terms of
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
sex and gender
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
but the bill specifically requires
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
recording of a student's sex or gender
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
there are not two different fields
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
involved this is requiring one field
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
to designate
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
your vendor
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i i think that
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
you are wants to have two designations
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh you're looking at a different piece
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
brooks out of tanner
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i i just want to i know we're
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
kind of about risk management too
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
um and when you talk about etopic pros
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
pregnancies it happens in about two
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
percent of total pregnancies
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh and death occurring from those is is
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
very small
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
um if they're you know they're taken
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
care of
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
on the other hand transgender students
 
01:45:35.119 --> 01:45:36.070 align:start position:0%
on the other hand transgender students
have

01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
something like a 41 percent
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt rate
 
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.830 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt rate
uh

01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's an enormous difference
 
01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:46.709 align:start position:0%
that's that's an enormous difference
uh

01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
in risk management
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
and as we've mentioned before
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh in order to get medical
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
attention medical care and the the files
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the school nurse has or the school
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
doctor that does the the sports
 
01:46:00.639 --> 01:46:01.830 align:start position:0%
doctor that does the the sports
physicals

01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
physicals
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
in those particular documents
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
they have to be done by the parent
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that those those documents
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
document what what the student is
 
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.870 align:start position:0%
document what what the student is
undergoing

01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
undergoing
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
particularly in transition because
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
there's probably hormones involved as
 
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
there's probably hormones involved as
well

01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
or maybe in treatment and
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
an issue that that
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
is already taken care of this this is
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
just this this has been done by the
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so that people don't get harassed
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
when they get stopped
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's all this is this is to
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
help students their parents
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
students who are particularly at risk
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
high risk thank you thank you represent
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
like us
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm looking at this having
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
while i have taught i knew my students
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
when i taught
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
but i subbed for three years as well and
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
i subbed in a variety of different
 
01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.270 align:start position:0%
i subbed in a variety of different
schools

01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.310 align:start position:0%
schools
and

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
as a sub i did try to get to know a lot
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the kids that i saw but i often came
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
across kids that i didn't
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
and um doing something more than just
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the same column
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
putting a x or whatever then i have to
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
embarrass the child
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
by saying
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
i you know
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
what what do you want to become what you
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
what what
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever and that child may be shy
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i know as a child i was very shy and
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
to have to yet go once again
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
through the fact that i wanted to be a
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
different pronoun or whatever
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
would have been extremely embarrassing
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
to me to be called in front of the whole
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
school and it would be much easier if um
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
this was expanded
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
anyway i see you shaking your head bro
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
tanner so i will just be quiet
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to allow
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock to speak we've uh
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
some of you taking two three four times
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
to speak here um representative woodcock
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
do you have something further to say
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you first off and i
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
apologize my entire computer internet
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
went out because
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh apparently my uh plug wasn't it and i
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
missed all of representative cordelli's
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh speech i'm sure all the people who
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
took care of whatever it was and i
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
apologized glenn because they didn't
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
hear what you said um that being said uh
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
all due respect to representative lakers
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
nobody stands in the front of the room
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
and say they don't know what to call you
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
i mean if you see something in your
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
student teacher notes that says
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
something about a youngster you make
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
down well sure you figure it out to talk
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
or something you never i mean you're
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
never embarrassing anyone like that
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
that'd be the worst thing you could
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
possibly do
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and most schools have orientations
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
for a team orientation for youngsters um
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
and that may have been already covered
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that come in so i just want to
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
clarify that point and once again say
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
this this is something as representative
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
shaw said is very simple and it can say
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
and it can save a huge amount of
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination and bullying and negative
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
influence on youngsters but these kids
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
are adolescents we know this this is the
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
worst time in their life everyone's a
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
bully in that school and we talk about
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating bullying folks that's not
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
happening and but we can make sure we
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
can give one step forward to make it
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
easier for parents and easier for
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
youngsters um that's all you gotta do is
 
01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.390 align:start position:0%
youngsters um that's all you gotta do is
just

01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
hold off and retain
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
pass the bill and allow families and
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
youngsters to to help and be respected
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
in schools and be safe you'll be saving
 
01:49:33.679 --> 01:49:34.629 align:start position:0%
in schools and be safe you'll be saving
someone

and then
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation and the talent
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%

01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
he said importantly i think that it
 
01:52:50.719 --> 01:52:51.830 align:start position:0%
he said importantly i think that it
prevents

01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh scenarios where someone could play
 
01:52:54.239 --> 01:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
uh scenarios where someone could play
politics

01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
politics
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
an incumbent could wait until
 
01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.189 align:start position:0%
an incumbent could wait until
um

01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
half an hour before the deadline to file
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
um withdrawal and have his friends
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
standing beside him uh register when no
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
one else was able to
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
register for uh that ballard position
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
so i think that there is a safeguard
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
against uh trained politics
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%

01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative just
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
a couple quick things so this this would
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
take uh if i is this correct now this
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
would this would take away
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
the principal's current prerogative of
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
accepting coursework
 
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.030 align:start position:0%
accepting coursework
locally

01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
locally
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
with the clarification representative
 
01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
with the clarification representative
leon

01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
if i
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
i believe actually can i refer that to
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
the author of the amendment or
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's a question this question you
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
brought the amendment is asking does
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
that does this now take away the
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
standard practice of the pres the
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
principal the local school local school
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
high school particularly making the
 
02:00:09.599 --> 02:00:10.709 align:start position:0%
high school particularly making the
decision

02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
um it standardizes it to what's
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
happening with the military and they're
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
there this is something uh
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
as i understand it standardize it with
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
the military compact from the question
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
is it's a local principle now the
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
authority they lose it
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh the principal or the administrator of
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
the high school that's receiving this
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
credit uh has the option
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
with accordance with that amendment to
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
say no we're not going to do that
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
it does require that principle or that
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
administrator to provide reasonable
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
justification for that denial
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
so it does say that the principles may
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
and can deny it it includes that in that
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
same sentence
 
02:00:57.679 --> 02:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
same sentence
well

02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
rather than lay for a lad follow-up
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
please if i'm looking at the amendment
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
at line
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh five and six or six particularly it
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
says shall grant credit it doesn't say
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
may it says shout
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
so that that that's not an option
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
and it says four shall provide
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable justification for denial
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
but the sentence question i may i'm
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
going to raise my may representative lad
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
is just
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're all still aware that the now the
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
school board association said it's not
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
necessary the secondary safe association
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
says not necessary and the public input
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
was eight in favor 96 against i mean
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is really not a necessary bill it's
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
not it's not military families at all
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
military families are already under a
 
02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:47.109 align:start position:0%
military families are already under a
compact

02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
compact
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
as it has nothing to do with military
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
families we throw that in there as
 
02:01:50.159 --> 02:01:51.270 align:start position:0%
families we throw that in there as
alignment

02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to respond that i just received
 
02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.470 align:start position:0%
i'd like to respond that i just received
a

02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.350 align:start position:0%
a
letter

02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
from an individual and i'm going to read
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's an example i know a student
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
transferred from new york that person
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
took algebra in eighth grade it meant
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
all the standards and requirements but
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
since it was not taking a grade nine the
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
school refused to grant credit despite
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that she was in her senior year
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
and have already been accepted to
 
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
college at the time the decision was
 
02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
college at the time the decision was
rendered

02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
rendered
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's the issue we're trying to resolve
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
that when it comes in from another
 
02:02:27.679 --> 02:02:28.550 align:start position:0%
that when it comes in from another
school

02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:02:30.159 --> 02:02:30.950 align:start position:0%
and it's
and

02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
the principal has the option then to
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
look to see if the standards were met if
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
it reflected what they asked for
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
and their school then
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
it should be accepted represent i saw
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
your hand up i just find that that
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's that this argument you're making
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
here this is an unconfirmed letter we
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from the person we don't
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
know whether this story is true or not
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
we don't even know what the details are
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know why the district rejected
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
it uh there may be other reasons we
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't make state law based upon a single
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
story unconfirmed with no detail from a
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
single individual
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
i mean that this is it's ludicrous what
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is we saw no
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
evidence that this is a problem right
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
now there was no testimony virtually no
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that there was a problem and
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
when we asked about velax or anything
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
else there was no testimony that this is
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
an issue right now so you are trying to
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
solve something that is there is not
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that there is a problem thank
 
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.030 align:start position:0%
evidence that there is a problem thank
you

02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:36.870 align:start position:0%
you
cornell

02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
velex had come up in the original
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussion so i did check with velax and
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
they said they actually have very few if
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
any problems with their classes being
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
accepted um the only time it might be is
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
when they want it to be accepted as a
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
course for for that's required for
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
graduation and the school said no that
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
is an elective
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
and they understand that it was an
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
elective that the this
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
family was trying to get um
 
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
family was trying to get um
called

02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
called
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
a credit course and so i checked with
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
caitlyn davis at the department of
 
02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
education if they hear
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
that velax is
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
not being accepted at schools and she
 
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
not being accepted at schools and she
said

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
she could not recollect any except in
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
the same case that a parent here or
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
there would call to say
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
that the school is not accepting
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
something as a
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
required credit toward graduation when
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
it was an elective course so velax
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
themselves that they have a wonderful
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
relationship with almost every single
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
public school in the state and have no
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
problem especially when they check with
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
the school first and say we're going to
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
take this for vlax for credit and then
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's no problem whatsoever so velax
 
02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
it's no problem whatsoever so velax
isn't

02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
relax and the department of education
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have spoken with
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
several parents that have had a problem
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
with transferring credits and having
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
courses accepted
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
even more i've heard from many many
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
parents who are very concerned that the
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
credit may not be accepted at a later
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
date this is something that's stifling
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
education choices right now and is
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
leading parents to be afraid of doing
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
anything other than following the
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
prescribed path even if that isn't the
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
one that best suits the student's
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
education so this is something that may
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
not be may not have a large impact for
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
all students but it is keeping some
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
students from from having the coursework
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
that they want the one that will benefit
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
them and will drive them towards their
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
college education and as we did here i
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
have heard similar testimony as chairman
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
lad about um about having these these
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
late rejections that are impacting
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
students college acceptance and this
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think we need to
 
02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think we need to
treat

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
treat
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
all students the same whether or not
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
they come from a military or from
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
another state or from another district
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
if the course is accepted because
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
from a military compact then it should
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
also be accepted if they come from
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
another state
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i want saying that thank you
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
i contacted our superintendent of
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
schools in the merrimack valley school
 
02:06:38.719 --> 02:06:39.750 align:start position:0%
schools in the merrimack valley school
district

02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
about v-lacs being accredited and his
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
reply was
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
assuming the online courses are taken
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
via an accredited institution like velax
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the enrollment in such courses has
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
been collaboratively planned through a
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
student's schedule process
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
credits are granted towards graduation
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question mr
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you represent cornell
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
i will just mention that
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
i attended the elac graduation ceremony
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
year before last
 
02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
year before last
fantastic

02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
event you should all try and attend one
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
but i did talk to the director
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
um at that time and he confirmed that
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
there were districts uh not accepting uh
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
velax uh credits uh and i also talked
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
with a former state representative whose
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
husband um if uh
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
the uh chair of the board of trustees um
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
and uh they confirmed the same thing i
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
do not recall if i asked what schools in
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
particular uh but i just wanted to make
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um i
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
voiced this
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
concern when we first went over the bill
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll voice it again
 
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
and i'll voice it again
um

02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable justification
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
is a term that's in this bill
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
and that the principal has to come up
 
02:08:12.079 --> 02:08:13.030 align:start position:0%
and that the principal has to come up
with

02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sure that there's going to be
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
some sort of process built up to appeal
 
02:08:18.159 --> 02:08:19.109 align:start position:0%
some sort of process built up to appeal
this

02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
um and it's such a big term to begin
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
with what it what's considered
 
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable who who is the person who
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
actually makes the
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
the decision that it's reasonable if the
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
parents don't think it's reasonable is
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
it reasonable
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
um and i'm thinking that that probably
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
is going to go to the department of
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
education and i think
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to know
 
02:08:43.119 --> 02:08:44.310 align:start position:0%
that we need to know
um

02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
more about that particular part of the
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
little part of this bill i i realize
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's two words in this bill but i
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
think it makes a world of difference
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
um in what the principal has to go
 
02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
um in what the principal has to go
through

02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things maybe they need to
 
02:09:00.719 --> 02:09:01.669 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things maybe they need to
uh

02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
base their reasonable justification on
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
if if they have required courses that
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
are specific to a school district
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
and that course can only be taken at the
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
specific to that district
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
can they refuse somebody from using
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
an elective course as a as a substitute
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
for that that that seems to be
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues if if you have to
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
take new hampshire history and you live
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's you know that's
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
going to be part of your school district
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
course but if you're coming in from new
 
02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:38.069 align:start position:0%
course but if you're coming in from new
york

02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
york
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't make meet that
 
02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't make meet that
requirement

02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
um so i i think
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's a real issue with that and um
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
plus the issue that as
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock said it starts
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
out with
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
the principal shall accept credit um i
 
02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:56.629 align:start position:0%
the principal shall accept credit um i
think

02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's the principal makes the decision
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just uh add a few more words
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
here that
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
within the
 
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
military contact it starts out the
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
purpose of this legislation is to remove
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
barriers to educational success imposed
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
on children and families because of
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
moving or job assignments etc of their
 
02:10:19.599 --> 02:10:21.189 align:start position:0%
moving or job assignments etc of their
parents

02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and we know that occurs frequently
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
within the military
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
however we also know that our our
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
society today
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
beyond the military is very global
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
and we have others that are moving about
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
this country as well and throughout the
 
02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.390 align:start position:0%
this country as well and throughout the
world

02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
world
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
i cannot understand why
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
if we can have it set up in law like
 
02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.149 align:start position:0%
if we can have it set up in law like
this

02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the military but it just won't work
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
for anybody else it seems to me that
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
by doing it this way we are
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
discriminating against a certain
 
02:10:55.599 --> 02:10:56.950 align:start position:0%
discriminating against a certain
population

02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
based on we're allowing it for one but
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:13.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh chair may i have a follow up on my
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
if the if the department of defense
 
02:11:29.599 --> 02:11:31.189 align:start position:0%
if the if the department of defense
education

02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
um schools
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh have a policy that they have to
 
02:11:36.079 --> 02:11:37.030 align:start position:0%
uh have a policy that they have to
accept

02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
accept
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
any credit coming in to them
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
from a student who may be already

leaves for tuesday next
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
um i'll go through the bills which we
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
have uh the four remaining bills
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh 255 that's the limited liability
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
business uh bill we have
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
university right
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
then we have 202 that's the school lunch
 
02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:16.950 align:start position:0%
then we have 202 that's the school lunch
program

02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
and 203 uh the commission study of the
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
school lunch program
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then we come down to 388 manifest
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
education hardship
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
those i believe are the four remaining
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
bills we have
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
so i i i feel that uh
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh and remember when we meet next
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
tuesday we'll be starting at 10 30 due
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the fact that the senate head is
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
starting at nine
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
and it was very difficult i know for
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
those wanting to testify to be gone and
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
run an exact at that time so we're
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 30.
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
with those four bills i would expect we
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
would be out
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
