00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
bye

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes sir this proposal was before the
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee last month
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
and the committee decided to postpone
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
after a robust uh discussion
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
the proposal makes changes to the rules
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the ignition interlock devices
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
previously you heard testimony in
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
regards to the alcohol set point in the
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
rule which is on page six of the
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
public testimony indicated
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
that there was a concern that the
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
devices are not set correctly that it
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
should be set at .025
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
statute rsa 265 a37
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
is establishes penalties if someone has
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
a breath concentration of 0.025 but it
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
does not require that the device be set
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
at that level
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
the department indicated that the .020
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
is the industry standard and in
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with the department it
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what the industry
 
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:51.509 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what the industry
does

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that pretty much summarizes uh the
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
the remaining issue with the proposal
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the department is here to answer any
 
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
and the department is here to answer any
questions

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
good morning martin montgomery from the
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
i have also representatives from the dmv
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
if anybody would like them to step
 
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
if anybody would like them to step
forward

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
it was my recollection that last month
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
when we were here
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
there was bob blaisdell representing one
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the vendors who had expressed certain
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
concerns uh two of them he had
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
my recollection again was that he
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
withdrew them and the one that was
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
remaining related to
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
um new customers having to pass three
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
since the last meeting we did meet with
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh bob and his
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
representatives from
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
the company intoxlock
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
and i am authorized to represent that um
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
after our conference call and a
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort we are all on the
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
same page bob also stated that they
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarity and the ongoing
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
open door to discuss and work together
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
on any issues that may arise
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
as a result we encourage jail card to
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
move forward with the proposed rules
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
i think that was one of the issues
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is not a new requirement
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
in our current rules that are continued
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
the set point the alcohol set point was
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
established at .020
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
the model specs were a
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
1992 version of the
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
national highway traffic safety
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
administration which we incorporated by
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
reference we updated it in this rules
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the model specs
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
dictate again
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
their recommendation that the alcohol
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
set point be 0.020 once again the set
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
point only stops the vehicle from
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
starting it it does not register as a
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
violation to the user
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
i would also point out
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we do have
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
a handful
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
of under 21
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
in the alcohol ignition interlock
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
program and
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
at a 0.020
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're considered driving while
 
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
they're considered driving while
impaired

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
so a violation under our program at .026
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
would allow them to start the vehicle in
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
if they're at a .020 it should be a dwi
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would also bring up is
 
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would also bring up is
that

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
i think there was concern about whether
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
or not the commissioner had the
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
authority and i had pointed out to our
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
where the legislature had
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
authorized the commissioner to set forth
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
the specs for the devices and certify
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
those devices that is not
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
dissimilar to what the legislature has
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
done with regards to the breathalyzers
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
that is used out there where the
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislature has delegated to the
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner to set forth those devices
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i would encourage
 
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
so with that i would encourage
the

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
um yep the conversation
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
last time
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
said that if you set it at zero
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh two zero okay
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
uh two zero okay
and

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
the vehicle won't
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
the vehicle won't
start

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
then you have taken a punitive action
 
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.710 align:start position:0%
then you have taken a punitive action
that

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
included in the legislation and that's
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
the part that bothers me and i think
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
bothered some of the other people
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a teetotaler so i'm not going to
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
worry too much about it for me but if i
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
go out there and i am not
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
legally drunk for the statute
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
and there's no requirement out there for
 
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.030 align:start position:0%
and there's no requirement out there for
me

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.230 align:start position:0%
me
to

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
do anything
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
then my vehicle not starting
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know if i blow a an o2o
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know where is the requirement that
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to stop my vehicle from
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
starting at that point that that's the
 
00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:15.829 align:start position:0%
starting at that point that that's the
question

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
so the the ignition interlock program is
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
also intended to be a behavior
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
modification tool and to help those
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
individuals recognize that even at a
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
individuals recognize that even at a
0.020

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
0.020
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
they might be impaired uh the for for
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
someone over 21 it's 0.08
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature has indicated that
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
anyone driving over 0.025
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
where in statute
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
either federal or state
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
do you have the right to stop my vehicle
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
from starting
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
if i have an 02
 
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
if i have an 02
0

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
0
 
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.150 align:start position:0%
0
3

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
3
 
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.270 align:start position:0%
3
okay

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
because that's what you've told me is
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to stop my vehicle from
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
starting if i have that and i'm not
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
legally drunk
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
so we're in statute
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
is that covered
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
0.024 again it's the model
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
specifications that we incorporated by
 
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.990 align:start position:0%
specifications that we incorporated by
reference

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
federal register volume 78 number 89
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
that makes the recommendation that the
 
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.510 align:start position:0%
that makes the recommendation that the
device

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
device
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
locked the ignition interlock at 0.020
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
it does not register it's a violation of
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
the user
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
which means in essence it's 0.005
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it's about
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know there are variables weight
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
food the individual themselves but it's
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
again you use the word recommendation i
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
asked you is it in the statute either
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
federal or state
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm guessing that the answer is no
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
i would refer back to the legislature
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
giving the commissioner the authority to
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
to establish and i'm trying to find it
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
for you sir
 
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.549 align:start position:0%
for you sir
um

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
the department of safety 265 a 36 roman
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
numeral 5 shall establish rules pursuant
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
to 541a for the approval of ignition
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
interlock devices and for the licensing
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
of approved interlock service providers
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
and to that end the department has set
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
forth what those minimum requirements
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
are for approved devices to be used in
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to keep this debate up but
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
further in the statute
 
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
further in the statute
the

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
limit is actually set in there when
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
certain actions are taken
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we've given him permission but
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've also told him that this is where
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
punitive action starts
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so again i
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
i have problems over the way that the
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
this set point is established if the
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
department wants the set point in
 
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
department wants the set point in
statute

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know fine come to us we'll write the
 
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
you know fine come to us we'll write the
lsr

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
lsr
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
but right now i don't see where you have
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
the authority to put that set point down
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
as low as you are to stop the vehicle
 
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.430 align:start position:0%
as low as you are to stop the vehicle
carol

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have two two
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions one is what's the
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that i don't know
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to defer here to um the cmp
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you because that matters i
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
mean um i think that that's okay you
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that's fine yeah
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the other question
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chair
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
you just said that if someone is under
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
the age of 21 and they're
 
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.950 align:start position:0%
the age of 21 and they're
blowing

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
blowing
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
two to
 
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.149 align:start position:0%
two to
zero

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
they're in violation or is that a
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
current permit
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's a dwi
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
so right and do you in fact
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
treat it as such
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
we are not you just let it shut the car
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
not start the car
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's up to law enforcement i mean if
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're but what it does is stop the
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
driver from driving
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
for 20 minutes
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
i would also like to add that you know
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
one of the comments that we received
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
during the public comment period from
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
the vendor
 
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.230 align:start position:0%
the vendor
um

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
most ignition interlock programs have an
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol set point at which the device
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
will prevent a vehicle from being
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
started and a separate alcohol set point
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
at which the breath test result passes a
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
threshold and becomes a violation and i
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
closed that quote so so we that's where
 
00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
closed that quote so so we that's where
we

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
included a definition for the violation
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
set point as opposed to the alcohol set
 
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.029 align:start position:0%
set point as opposed to the alcohol set
point

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
later

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so uh i have the i
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
think we all have the same issue
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh not whether this is a good idea now
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a functioning technology or
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature but rather
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
whether it is legally based uh in other
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
words whether you have the authority or
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
not now you
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
made mention a moment ago
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
of something that um
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
that i want to explore a little bit
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
further and that is that
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
so if under the way that the device
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
works uh the vehicle won't start if
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
you're at that level right 0.20 0.02
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's right so the thing is you said
 
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
that's right so the thing is you said
that

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's a time element involved too
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
so in other words the vehicle won't
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
start but within
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
what period of time
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
i realize it it varies depending on the
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
size of the person the weight and all
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
that other kind of stuff there's a lot
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
of variables here
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that the person
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
initially can't start their car and that
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
may not be punitive per se but you are
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
depriving the person of uh
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
the the ability to start their vehicle
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
even though the statute does not clearly
 
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.710 align:start position:0%
even though the statute does not clearly
establish

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
establish
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh that that is the appropriate level uh
 
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
uh that that is the appropriate level uh
but

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
the time factor in another couple of
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
minutes five minutes whatever the the
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
the body has con has processed the
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol and the level would drop right
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
correct can you can you speak to that
 
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
correct can you can you speak to that
issue

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
that aspect i am not somebody
 
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:32.630 align:start position:0%
that aspect i am not somebody
um

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
well
so

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding and i i did inquire
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
from our expert well they're not experts
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
but people much more knowledgeable than
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
me in the forensic lab um that
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
if if it dissipates
 
00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
if if it dissipates
0.015

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
0.015
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
on average you're talking about a third
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
to drop down between
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
let's say 0.025 to 0.020 or 0.020 so
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
whatever if you're right at 0.020
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
in order to go down you're you
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
just figure that .005 is 20 minutes
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
plus or minus so anything less would be
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you are at .020
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
even in five minutes it's evaporating as
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
long as you're not consuming anything
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to detect any alcohol
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's mouthwash
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay absent emotion can we go to the
 
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.630 align:start position:0%
okay absent emotion can we go to the

representative tucker
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
your vote

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
it seems as though the problem is that
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
age 18 to 21
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
and then above so
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
one law one device is trying to deal
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
with two different age groups
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be the root of the
 
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.990 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be the root of the
problem

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
and how how can that be
 
00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
and how how can that be
handled

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
do people need to rethink whether we
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
should have a separate
 
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.470 align:start position:0%
should have a separate
non

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
non
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know eight
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
difference between 18 and 21
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
that apparently
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
is trying to change behavior with a
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
younger group
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem as though the
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
technology of the
 
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
technology of the
device

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
device
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
lends itself to two different
 
00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:11.269 align:start position:0%
lends itself to two different
uh

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
set numbers
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
so yes i i it seems bigger than just
 
00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.310 align:start position:0%
so yes i i it seems bigger than just
objecting

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
objecting
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
that it's a problem with the way the
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
you're

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right that they're
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
two separate enforce two separate limits
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
with the same device set the same way
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
and the other problem is that apparently
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
the industry and
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
the powers that be not just in this
 
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
the powers that be not just in this
state

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:49.669 align:start position:0%
believe that
0.020

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
0.020
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
in order to shut off their to make sure
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
the car doesn't start where i'm they're
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
on the brink of become of being drunk
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
rather than being actually
 
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.230 align:start position:0%
rather than being actually
impaired

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.549 align:start position:0%
impaired
is

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
some of us are questioning that position
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
may i ask a question of uh
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
would the basis for the objection be a
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
lack of authority for the 0.020
 
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.269 align:start position:0%
lack of authority for the 0.020
yes

00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
peter so so
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
one of the issues here i mean i agree
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
with senator gray's initial statement
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
the statute just does not say
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
that you have the authority to go below
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
as the device currently operates i don't
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the device
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
but the
possible

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
way we can look at this is what ms
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
madigliani has been talking about
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
several times is we have given the
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner some authority here with
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
regard to setting the level and so that
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
that that made the commission or the
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
feel that that that's sufficient
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
authority to proceed but i am troubled
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
by the fact that the statute simply does
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
not authorize the level that the device
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
is operating at and i don't see anybody
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
on the board on the committee talking
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
against that concept
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to point out um what
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
attorney mo digliani pointed to which
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
was rsa 265 a5
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
roman numeral five um f it may be broad
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
enough um to incorporate this standard
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
it may not be it says that the um
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
commit this is uh the uh commissioner's
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
um rule making authority pursuant to
 
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.549 align:start position:0%
um rule making authority pursuant to
541a

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
such other matters as are required to
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
carry out the provisions of this chapter
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
relative to alcohol concentration tests
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
that may be broad enough
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know to support that they have some
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
you know to support that they have some
authority

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
if you agree to the objection you'll say
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes and if you
 
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.310 align:start position:0%
yes and if you
oppose

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
the idea of objecting to the rule you'll
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
say no
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative tucker yes
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative burstname yes
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
reluctantly yes
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
senator apprentice reluctantly yes
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
senator gray yes
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
senator ward yes
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
the chair votes no
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
oplc

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
so the first item on the agenda is 22 54
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
which is the opel seas practice and
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
procedural rules
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
the staff did have a number of comments
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
on this rule that were addressed in a
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
later filed conditional approval request
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
however on the
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
final approval
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me final proposal there are two
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
notes to jail card that i just wanted to
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
mention before i started to address the
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
the first is on page six it's a note
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
bodies regulated by the oplc
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
there may need to be some statutory
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
clarification as the statute only
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
or only uses the terms boards councils
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
or commissions
 
00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:11.029 align:start position:0%
or commissions
whereas

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
four of these are
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
advisory boards and do not fall into any
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
of those three categories and one uh
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
number six the ophthalmic dispensing uh
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
is not an up any sort of border entity
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
at all it's more of just an action
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
of dispensing contact lenses and things
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
note to jail car which is found
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
later on in the rule
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
has to do with the oplc's authority to
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
suspend revoke
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
or deny an initial license
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
upon looking at the criteria that's laid
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
forth in this proposal it seems as
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
though they are pretty straightforward
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
such as non-payment of fines not
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
complying with administrative orders and
 
00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.269 align:start position:0%
complying with administrative orders and
therefore

00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:04.710 align:start position:0%
may be
not

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
a problem under the rules as they are
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
written now but i did just want to bring
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
that to jail cars attention
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
for the conditional approval request
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the only
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
comments staff had
 
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
comments staff had
was

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
some unclear comments regarding the
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
participation of
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
individuals telephonically in hearings
 
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
individuals telephonically in hearings
the

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
oplc has proposed some rules on uh
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
holding remote
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
or virtual hearings however they say
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
that in their definitions
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
this is to be done via electronic means
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
and only mention
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh electronic meaning platforms and do
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
not mention anything regarding
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
telephonic participation but then later
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
on in the rules um specifically
 
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
on in the rules um specifically
plc20606b

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
mentioned

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.470 align:start position:0%
mentioned
providing

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
telephone numbers
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
to participants and then additionally
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
for preliminary
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me pre-hearing conferences
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
in pl
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
c 206 17b it specifically says that
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
those are to be done telephonic
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
and therefore i think the rules need a
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarification on when
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
telephonic is appropriate and when
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
electronic means are appropriate
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
and those are the only comments that i
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
had thank you
 
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.549 align:start position:0%
had thank you
questions

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
we have a motion
 
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
we have a motion
oh

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
oh
yes

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
i have a question are these meetings
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
covered by 91a are they required to be
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
public meetings
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative lindsay courtney
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh certainly when you convene a quorum
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
of a public body that is covered by 91a
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
um an exemption to that is for
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing conferences that occur only
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
with the presiding officer and with the
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
parties prior to
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
an actual
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
adjudication okay does but 91a as of now
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
does not allow
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
remote participation
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
in most cases in most cases it does not
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
allow remote participation by members of
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
the public body but it's completely
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
silent as to members of the public
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
attending remotely
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
as well as participants in an
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearing it's just the
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
members of the public body that are
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
required to be physically present
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
motion

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
peter i have a
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman so are you
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
providing remote access for the public
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the case of what you've said
 
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
in the case of what you've said
because

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
if you're not providing for remote
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
access then
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that it could be permitted
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
under your interpretation which i would
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
if you're not providing it then it's
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's meaningless
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
we do provide it we have been providing
 
00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:22.470 align:start position:0%
we do provide it we have been providing
it

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic our boards meet in
 
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.550 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic our boards meet in
person

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
physically meet in person at our offices
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
but we for transparency to the public
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
have always provided since march of 2020
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
a zoom link for the public to just watch
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
and we find that particularly in
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
adjudications where witnesses are out of
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
state and may be outside of our subpoena
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
authority that it allows attendance for
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
for those individuals
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up so um
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
and and is the public aware of this and
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
are they provide and are they
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
participating on that basis absolutely
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
we find greater participation we notice
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
the public meetings uh with a physical
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
location but we also
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
allow members of the public to
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
to observe via the zoom link and you're
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
saying that is happening oh yes
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you that's important
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:24.069 align:start position:0%

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.670 align:start position:0%
on the condition of the staff comments
yes

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.470 align:start position:0%
yes
oh

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
oh

motion by schmidt second by gray
 
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.310 align:start position:0%

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh mr chair so this rule
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
relates specifically to oplc's ability
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
to set fees for
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
the boards under its
 
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.470 align:start position:0%
the boards under its
administration

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
i would just like to point out
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
the first comment i have is that um
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
this committee has
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
back on november 19 2020 voted that when
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
reviewing board rules to support the
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the oplc in possessing sole fee

has the authority to set the fee but

if legislative clarification is needed
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%

this emergency rule has been expired
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
since march 19 2020. so the committee
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
may have questions about whether the
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
agency has been enforcing

there is an interim rule that has also

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
once again the committee have may have

questions of whether the agency is

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
1002.16 there was just some language in
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
there regarding
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
the initial licensing where the
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
introductory language only discussed
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
fees so there was a question about why
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
there was language regarding
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
initial licensure in that particular
 
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:29.670 align:start position:0%

carol
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
i understand that it has been the intent
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
to give
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
the oplc the authority to set the fees
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
however in a couple of cases
 
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.349 align:start position:0%
however in a couple of cases
the

00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
actual fee is set in statute and the fee
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're proposing to adopt by rule is
 
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
you're proposing to adopt by rule is
different

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative are you referring to the
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
electrology fees i think
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
electrology yes there was a statutory
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
change this session um that went into
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
effect that eliminated that 110 fee but
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't i know it hasn't been updated on
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
and what have you been doing since since
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
the dentist's
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
rules expired
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh nothing we have not been receiving
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
payment the same is true with respect to
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%

lottery commission
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes sir um this proposal makes changes
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
to the rules on the employee incentive
 
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.710 align:start position:0%
to the rules on the employee incentive
program

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
which provides monetary incentives when
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
sales staff reach um specific goals
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's a one comment to bring to your
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
attention and that's on page two of the
 
00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:20.230 align:start position:0%
attention and that's on page two of the
proposal

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is because the rule no longer has
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
actual monetary amounts in the rule
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
the rule now creates an employee
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
recognition committee that will review
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
both the sales goals and the incentive
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
plans and we'll make changes to both
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
we had some concerns that not having the
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
amounts in the rule would not provide
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
employees with notice
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
on what the amounts are and we were also
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
concerned that changes to the goals and
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
incentives mid-stream
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
could potentially surprise the sales
 
00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.430 align:start position:0%
could potentially surprise the sales
employees

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
not allowing them to reach the new goals
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
the rule does create
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
or does require that there be a
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
salesperson and a sales manager on the
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
review committee
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
so um at least they do have some
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
representation and input
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
um we do know though that uh while the
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't affirmatively prevent or
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
allow the agency to create this review
 
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
allow the agency to create this review
committee

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
it does say that the incentive program
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
shall be implemented through rules so an
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
argument can be made
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
that this isn't what's actually
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
occurring it's
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
one step removed if you will
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
the jail car may have some questions
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
about this and may want to consider
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
clarifying the statute if they think
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
not permissible and the department is
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%

so the the rule as it was up um for
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
review this year we wanted to make sure
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
that it actually was more inclusive and
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
that it portrayed the changes that have
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
happened through the agency over the
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
past number of years
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
um scratch tickets are by far our number
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
one product that we sell
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
however there are other games that are
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
of importance that
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
the sales reps do look at and do
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
focus on when they are out in the field
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
with our retailers
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and over the past number of years there
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
have been other games that have been
 
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.589 align:start position:0%
have been other games that have been
added

00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process such as
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
i lottery keno
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
and other games that are gaining in
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
popularity so
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this we wanted to make
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
sure there were a few things that we
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
could do and some things that covid
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually brought to mind
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
with kovid sales rose
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 we were 18
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
higher than normal for scratch ticket
 
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.829 align:start position:0%
higher than normal for scratch ticket
sales

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
sales
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's huge growth
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
this past year we actually were negative
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
in growth compared to the year prior
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
because the sales were so enormous the
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
year prior
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
so the year during covid our sales reps
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
all received bonus
 
00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:56.950 align:start position:0%
all received bonus
and

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
during that time the growth was a lot of
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
it was outside of what they were
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
doing at retail it was just a growth of
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the fact that there was lack of
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
things where people could spend their
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
money on there was a lot of money spent
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
on scratch tickets
 
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:13.990 align:start position:0%
on scratch tickets
so

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
what we started to realize is the bonus
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that we could
 
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that we could
change

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
um for them and that was apparent this
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
year when the sales goal was too high
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
and none of them got bonus
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
because we
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
sadly don't have a crystal ball so we
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
can't tell what's going to happen in the
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
economy nobody predicted what was going
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
to happen
so

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
one year we're way too high with all the
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
sales reps getting bonus the next year
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
we're way too low with none of
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
them what we wanted to do with the sales
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
reps and they've been part of this
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
review group
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
is with them with their insight of
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the field
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
be able to create a bonus structure that
 
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
be able to create a bonus structure that
more

00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
correctly portrays what's going on
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
in the economy
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
so when we do have situations and
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
certainly it's not something that we
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
would be looking to change all the time
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
but when there are
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
societal impacts outside of our control
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
we want to also shift as we need to with
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
their consent
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
so this group that's created
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
has myself a sales manager and it says
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
one sales rep but there are actually
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
three on the committee so we are all on
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
the sales team
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
and then there's our cfo
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
as well as a commissioner
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
and our executive director
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
so with the group of us we're able to
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
have very different mindsets help create
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
a bonus structure that's based on our
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
sales but also what's going on in the
 
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
sales but also what's going on in the
world

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
so that we can shift if need be
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
so rather than
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
bonusing the sales reps strictly on one
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
product line
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have the ability to add in
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
other product lines as they become
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
available and if they seem reasonable to
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
bonus on
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
for instance fastplay is a product line
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
that you may not be familiar with
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
because it's largely unseen at retail
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
well if our sales reps are really
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on that we might see some
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
really great growth
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
in fact the year before last
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
we saw over 200 percent growth in this
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
product line and we think that there's
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
more to grow there
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
so with the sales reps having those
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
really great communications at retail to
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
focus on this we think that we can see
 
00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
focus on this we think that we can see
more

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
growth there as well as some of the
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
other games that are not jackpot driven
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
give me five lucky for life
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
or looking at how many of their
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
retailers receive bonus in a certain
 
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.270 align:start position:0%
retailers receive bonus in a certain
year

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
so we're just looking to be able to look
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
through a greater lens rather than
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
honing in on one product line
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
and looking to also
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
not set a firm amount but look at what
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
we have available in the budget to be
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
offer that so
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the past it was very clear that was a
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
thousand or two thousand for each
 
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.230 align:start position:0%
thousand or two thousand for each
quarter

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then there's an annual bonus well
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
the annual bonus really was just
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
reaffirming what had already happened
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
that year so
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
with the sales reps we said let's let's
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
not do that let's just have four
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
quarters and they were they've been a
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
part of this whole process to create
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
this rule and have been
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
advocating for this change
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
so if there are any questions i'm happy
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
senator greg
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'd like you to respond
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
to how
 
00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:45.589 align:start position:0%
to how
the

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
statute supports what you're doing
 
00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:49.829 align:start position:0%
statute supports what you're doing
that's

00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
so i i could say um senator gray like i
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
said at the outset um the statute and
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
rsa 26 or 284 21h
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
the language there says the lottery
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
commission may develop and implement an
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
employee recognition program for
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
monetary incentives to promote increased
 
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.109 align:start position:0%
monetary incentives to promote increased
sales

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
sales
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to say the incentive
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
program shall be implemented through
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
rules adopted by the lottery commission
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
so like i said earlier there is an
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
argument to be made that this is one
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
step removed in that
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
the agency is implementing but through
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee right it sounds like a good
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
idea in that that they have
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
input from the sales rep and from the
 
00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:40.630 align:start position:0%
input from the sales rep and from the
managers

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
managers
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
on what those monetary incentives should
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
be and what the goals are based on
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
what's occurring on the ground but the
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
statute does say that the incentive
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
program shall be implemented through
 
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.270 align:start position:0%
program shall be implemented through
rules

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.870 align:start position:0%
rules
and

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
like i said so there's no monetary
 
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.470 align:start position:0%
like i said so there's no monetary
amounts

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
in the rule so you can make that
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
argument or make the case that it's not
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually being implemented through the
 
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.670 align:start position:0%
actually being implemented through the
rules

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i would add that
 
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.589 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i would add that
as

00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh kim has said it sounds like a great
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
idea and it sounds from what the agency
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
has said that they need flexibility to
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
change this based on economic conditions
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
out there
but

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
i think they need either a statutory
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
change or a statutory exemption in order
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
move to approve with the requirement
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
that the lottery commission work with
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature to
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
clarify the statute so that this is
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
motion by mcguire second by bursting
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
all those in favor aye aye aye
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
any opposed
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir this proposal makes changes to
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
the application rules for salespersons
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
and brokers
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval request has been
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
filed which resolves almost all of the
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
substantive issues
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
two issues to bring to your attention
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
um the first one is on page one
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
and this is um most likely just a a
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
matter of language tina and i were
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
talking about it before the meeting
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
and um it's this um
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
comment in the middle of the page on
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
the language here says for principal
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
broker applicants check either yes or no
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
to that state following statement
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
so it just is unclear um the language
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
just needs to be cleaned up a little bit
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't recall what specifically
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
tina was going to suggest for that
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
language it sounds like my
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation wouldn't quite work with
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
that i'll go ahead and let tina comment
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm tina kelly
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
program specialist at the office of
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
with that specific comment we would just
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
reword it
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
and for principal broker applicants
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
comma check either yes or no to the
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
following statement
 
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.910 align:start position:0%
following statement
okay

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.870 align:start position:0%
okay
the

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
next issue is
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
on page six and this comment is in
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
regards to the examination fees
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
the statute requires that the board set
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
the fees for the exams
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
and the fees are on the form
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
one is in the amount of 155 for the
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
sales reps
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
the other is 170 for the brokers and
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is their initial examination for
 
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.030 align:start position:0%
this is their initial examination for
licensing

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
but they're not in the rule and
 
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.390 align:start position:0%
but they're not in the rule and
actually

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the initial proposal
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
the language here stated that the
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
applicants were to pay what the vendor
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
established as the fee
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
and the oplc indicated that it would be
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
the vendor that would set the fee but
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
the statute clearly states that the
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
board needs to set the fee
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
so the fees are on the form but they're
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
not the rule so you may have some
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions about why that is and what
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
actually is occurring here
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
so it is the the third part the vendor
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
that um they go directly to the vendor
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
they pay the whatever fee is they charge
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
they fill out the application they take
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
the exam then everything's provided
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
to oplc
 
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.630 align:start position:0%
to oplc
um

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
i have spoken with the board's
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
administrator and once these rules if if
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
they are to pass
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
the fee will be taken right off the form
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
and we only link to the form
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
the the person who wants to take the
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
exam knows where the form is
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and as far as there there's no way to
 
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.150 align:start position:0%
um and as far as there there's no way to
to

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
put into rule what the exam company
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
would charge
 
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.109 align:start position:0%
would charge
so

00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a statutory change
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
because also you couldn't you can't
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
dictate um the fees for continuing
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
education that's outside vendors they
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
set their own fees so there's a lot of
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
changes in this one
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
portion of statute that will need to be
 
00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:48.710 align:start position:0%
portion of statute that will need to be
changed

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.589 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
i notice that the fiscal note
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
says that the fees are going to be
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
substantially increased
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what the justification
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the fees for
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
the licensure itself as opposed to the
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
examination obviously yes
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
i understand the issue
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
so i mean with the chair's permission
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to provide the committee with
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet of where the boards are at
 
00:55:21.119 --> 00:55:27.190 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet of where the boards are at
percentage-wise

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on the second page with
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
respect to the real estate commission
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the right hand column that
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
the boards are really all over the place
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of that
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
the ratio between expenses and income
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's been a ongoing uh long-standing
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
project that we've been trying to work
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
on to
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
get the fees where they need to be but
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the committee is well aware as
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
to why we have not been able to
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
accomplish that right now
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
the real estate commission
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
is presently at 95 percent
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
the um which obviously is 100 and it's
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
not between 100 and 125
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
so the average cost uh
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
per license
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
125 percent of cost per license is 86
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
and 32 cents
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
um so essentially when we ran the
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
numbers back in september which we
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
provided this information to the boards
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh a proposed fee adjustment and
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll notice on the 1002s that
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
the committee just reviewed the dental
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
fees actually go down
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
um 155 is the average cost
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
per license for two years and that's
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
precisely what
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
the real estate
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
commission is recommending in this
 
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.470 align:start position:0%
commission is recommending in this
proposal

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
real estate has essentially been
 
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.069 align:start position:0%
real estate has essentially been
subsidizing

00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
subsidizing
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
the cost of the license with the cost of
 
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:10.829 align:start position:0%
the cost of the license with the cost of
the

00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
examinations the examinations have been
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
so essentially they've been paying i
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
think it was 155 and 170 for
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
examinations but we are receiving a
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
windfall because that's not the actual
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
cost of the examinations so by moving
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
the examinations directly to the vendor
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating the requirement that the
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
person that the applicant come to us
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
first wait for us to certify that
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're authorized to test and then go
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
take the test which takes time
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
we would have lost revenue obviously
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
which requires the real estate
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
commission to adjust their fees to
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i i've never seen a document like
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
this before have you been doing this for
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
a while lindsey
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
that document um i put together last
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
september and i have revised it
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
on occasion um
 
00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:19.270 align:start position:0%
on occasion um
but

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.789 align:start position:0%
but
yes

00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
because this is i mean you have to know
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on and i i this is the kind
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
of thing that has to be done so we know
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
you guys have got to track this and this
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.990 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
opposed

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
i've not exactly been told
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
no in their annual report they've
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
included the
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
basic costs and the
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
ratios thank you mr chair
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
so 9a has to do with the
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
relative computation of the gross
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
tax this
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
rule is being brought forward due to
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
some legislative changes that occurred
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
the first comment um
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
is in 304 revenue 304.06
 
01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:21.430 align:start position:0%
is in 304 revenue 304.06
e

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
e
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
it is listed as an edit but it really
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
is more of an unclear comment as the
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
department has used
 
01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:31.829 align:start position:0%
department has used
may

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
when talking about
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's action in
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
response to whether or not further
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
adjustments of a formula are needed when
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
that really should be shall is it's not
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the department is here um in case
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
the commission has a committee has
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
questions for the department
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
i would add to rebecca's comment that
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
if the commission if the commissioner is
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
not going to do this
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
require this in every instance then they
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
need criteria in other words shall if or
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning my name is

king ming wong tax policy council of the

department of revenue
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
specific language that is being referred
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
to is on rev rule 304

panel 6e
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that language is specifically
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
referencing the rsa 77-83
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%

01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
rsa itself
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
the language that's used
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
the authority has given to the
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner is also a may authority
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
and anything further we fear might be
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
just overstepping the language that's
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
and if i may respond to that the reason
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the manual and why we require shall
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
be used with regard to department action
 
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
be used with regard to department action
is

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
even though the statutes give the
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
discretionary authority to the agency if
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
the agency determines that they want to
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
use that discretionary authority they
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
have to do so consistently
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore put it in rules so that
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
the public is aware
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
which is why rules otherwise it would
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
potentially result in oral rule making
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh which is in violation of rsa 541a
 
01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh which is in violation of rsa 541a
iii

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
iii
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
it is also i just want to point out that
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
it is also applied consistently in terms
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
of when when there is an audit and uh if
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
the department determines that there is
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
a need to all the
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the method that's being used by
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers does not fairly represent
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
the activities in new hampshire the
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment in new hampshire
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
then we would the department would
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
recommend a change in that um of course
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
in any time that the department
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
changes the uh the method that's being
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
used by the taxpayer
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
we the department will always have to
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
substantiate that to the taxpayer it's
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
not that the department will
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
require a change and and not justify
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
that because we will still be held
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
accountable to the taxpayer and if the
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayer does not agree um there is also
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
a method to for there's a there's a as
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
an approach for the taxpayer to object
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
to to the uh
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the department's
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions for the change for the
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation methodology and it can go
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
all the way up to
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
procedure in place where it's being
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
applied consistently then that should be
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
able to be codified in rules if there
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
already is a process in place then being
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
able to put that in rules
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
should be fairly easy
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the other situations
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
as attorney morel has pointed out uh you
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
can always use the shall
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
if or shall unless to kind of
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
give those kind of situations where the
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
rule uh the commissioner shall have uh
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
adjust from
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
fixing the formula i believe in my
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
conversations with attorney wong
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
he had brought up some sort of
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
negotiations that sometimes can occur or
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
some settlements that may occur once
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
again if that's a process that's being
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
used by the department it should be able
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it's um
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
we are following the language in the
 
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.670 align:start position:0%
we are following the language in the
statute

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
it is it is standard practice that's
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
being done in the past that um
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we've been following and it's not
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
like this is not a new change that we're
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
adopting for this particular uh
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
rule rule adoption
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
this rule
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
this language in this rule has been
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.430 align:start position:0%
here um
like

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.029 align:start position:0%
like
probably

01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
probably since 1999 because that's when
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
the statute was established
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
with this particular language and that
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
has also
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
be that would be the time when the uh
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
the rule language was established and
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
approved by jail car at that time
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'd like to point out that
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have become more aware of this issue
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
since 1999
 
01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.190 align:start position:0%
since 1999
and

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
we want to see what criteria and what
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
processes you use
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
when you are making these adjustments
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
so does that mean the the um
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
so the process would be the audit
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
process because the commissioner will
 
01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:01.990 align:start position:0%
process because the commissioner will
never

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
know of the um
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
of the the methodology that's being used
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
by the taxpayer until
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
unless it's audited that is audit i mean
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's i think that's a fair
 
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.029 align:start position:0%
that's that's i think that's a fair
statement

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
so um i'm not sure so so you're
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
in this section you're only talking
 
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
in this section you're only talking
about

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
what happens after an audit and not
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
general rule filing general tax filing
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is it will be
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
the authority is given for the general
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
tax filing too but for the commissioner
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
suggest a methodology for the
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
apportionment that the commissioner
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be aware of the methodology
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's being used by the taxpayer and
 
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.670 align:start position:0%
that's being used by the taxpayer and
in

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
in most instances that would be during
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
for the audit process
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
what could potentially occur is if it's
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
codified and codified in other rules the
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
audit process may be referencing those
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
rules here
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
as how the commissioner would determine
 
01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.670 align:start position:0%
as how the commissioner would determine
whether

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
an adjustment formula is needed but once
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
again if an adjustment to the formula is
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
necessary once again it needs to be
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
codified codified in the rules that
 
01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:23.109 align:start position:0%
codified codified in the rules that
how

01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
the first line of e says if further
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the formula are necessary
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
to accurately reflect the business
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
organization's business activity in new
 
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
organization's business activity in new
hampshire

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
well that seems to be the criteria right
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
there if that occurs then either the
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
business organization
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
needs to petition
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
the department or the commissioner has
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
to require
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
modification so
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm not certain why it couldn't just
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
be shell simply substitute the word
 
01:07:58.079 --> 01:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
be shell simply substitute the word
shell

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
shell
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the other concern that we also have is
 
01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
the other concern that we also have is
that

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
during audit there are times when the
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
audit is resolved through a settlement
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um and when that happens
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
what the if the language is shell would
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
the commissioner be still
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
um held to this language of this rule
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
and not the statute this is the language
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the rule
 
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.590 align:start position:0%
in the rule
to

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
to not be able to bind the hands of the
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner and not be able to move
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.229 align:start position:0%
forward and
administer

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
once again in that situation
 
01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.229 align:start position:0%
once again in that situation
using

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
potentially or the commissioner shall
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
require modifications under rsa
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
77a32 unless
 
01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:50.950 align:start position:0%
77a32 unless
negotiations

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
result in a settlement to correct the
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
formula or correct the miscalculation
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
something along those lines
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
to allow um for those situations
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
i would also put forward if we include
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
if we change the word to from made to
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
shell in the rule here
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so all the commissioner shall
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
require modification under rsa 7783
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
roman 2 and then when the taxpayer
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
refers back to the rsa itself saying
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
that it's a may requirement so does that
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
mean that okay yes the commissioner
 
01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.470 align:start position:0%
mean that okay yes the commissioner
shall

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
have the discretion that's allowed in
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
because if we change it to shell
 
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
because if we change it to shell
um

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.229 align:start position:0%
um
it's

01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
this commission shall follow the statute
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
in rsa 77832 at which the statute says
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner may then
 
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.829 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner may then
um

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
make the change would that be
 
01:09:51.199 --> 01:09:59.189 align:start position:0%
make the change would that be
satisfactory

01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry can can you repeat that
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
proposed language again so if we if the
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
language from in the rule is changed
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
from made to shell so the commissioner
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
shall require modification under 77832
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then when that cross-reference to
 
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.189 align:start position:0%
and then when that cross-reference to
77832

01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
77832
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
the language there is may so therefore
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
this the statute still requires a may so
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner will therefore
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
abiding by
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
77832 has that discretion would that be
 
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
77832 has that discretion would that be
satisfactory

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
once again i don't think so because the
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
statute when the statute uses made gives
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
the agency the discretion of whether or
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
not they want to use that authority but
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
once the agency commits to using that
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
authority then they have to use it
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
consistently and have it codified in the
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
rules on how they're going to use it um
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes i i agree that that the uh as you
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
say that the statute gives that
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
discretion to the commissioner so
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
i mean that is essentially what we're
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
referring to right now is that statute
 
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:11.110 align:start position:0%
referring to right now is that statute
language

01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
on this point i guess we're not going to
 
01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.990 align:start position:0%
on this point i guess we're not going to
agree

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i believe that
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
the may in the statute is
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know when we do this rule that
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can be consistent that
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
codifying whatever the commissioner's
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
desire is for
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
the may
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
be put in the rule
 
01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:37.510 align:start position:0%
be put in the rule
and

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know putting the exceptions in there
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly tightening up a lot of the
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
objections that we get on the rules
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee is that
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
the things that we're approving in the
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
rules aren't in the statute and things
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
rules aren't in the statute and things
change

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
i would like to see since this is on
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
august 26th i would like to see this go
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
back and the staff work with the
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
department and come back to us with
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
something that both of them can agree
 
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.870 align:start position:0%
something that both of them can agree
with

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't appear that we're
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
01:12:12.239 --> 01:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
may i respond
um

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
i understand senator gray's point but
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of back and forth
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
between the agency and staff and i think
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're just at an impasse
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if rebecca wants to chime
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
um i would agree we had this
 
01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.270 align:start position:0%
um i would agree we had this
conversation

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
prior to this committee meeting where
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
the agency took the same position
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
and we've had this discussion that we
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
just had in front of the committee um so
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
unless the agency is willing to change
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
that and work with that um that we are
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
just at an impasse at this point
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
how often does an impasse go to
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
to a judicial solution
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
is this a pretty common practice with
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
the department it depends on the uh it
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
depends on the taxpayers happen it
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
depends on the taxpayer how often does
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
this happen
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i don't have that
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.270 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i don't have that
information

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer may not bring it all the
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll postpone this until next
 
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:29.830 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll postpone this until next
month

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
9b

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
so 2022
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
86 once again has been brought forth due
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
to some changes
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
some legislative changes this one
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
specifically in the meals and rental tax
 
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.990 align:start position:0%
specifically in the meals and rental tax
rates

01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
rates
the

01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
comments from staff
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
have to do first
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:02.390 align:start position:0%
with the
fis

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
fis
 
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.510 align:start position:0%
fis
not

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
stating that there was a change
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the tax rate it says that there's no
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
difference between this rule and the
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
previous rule however this rule does
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
reference the new tax rate which is 8.5
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
percent and the previous rule referenced
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the previous tax rate which was nine
 
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.590 align:start position:0%
the previous tax rate which was nine
percent

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
not that there's much that can be done
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
on the fis at this point but just wanted
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
to bring that to the committee's
 
01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
to bring that to the committee's
attention

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the next comment is
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to the table that is in the
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
rule it is not in compliance with the
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
manuals formatting
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is specifically under

a

01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
does require that the rules comply with
 
01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
does require that the rules comply with
the

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
manual and the formatting in the manual
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
calculation it's not set up as a table
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
or illustration and doesn't have its own
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
rule number um so that's why there is
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
the unclear comment there
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
that would just have to be reformatted
 
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.350 align:start position:0%
that would just have to be reformatted
um

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then additionally as i stated there
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
was a comment with regard to the fis
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
that comment is also reflected in that
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
table as that's where the tax rate is
 
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
table as that's where the tax rate is
identified

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
so rev rule
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
702.11 that
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
table um as it may
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
essentially an example of a calculation
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's where that's the purpose of
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
that calculation there and that um as an
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
example it was using an older um
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
m r tax rate of nine percent
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're not attempting to change the
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
tax rate here with this uh amendment to
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
this rule we're attempting to change the
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
example that's being shown and uh the
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
calculation that was using
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
the older rate so we're just updating
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
the calculation the example to reflect
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
once again it's just a formatting issue
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
of not complying with the manual
 
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.310 align:start position:0%
of not complying with the manual
and

01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
not being
 
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.229 align:start position:0%
not being
uh

01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
correctly in the rules so um with regard
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
to the table
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
the committee has questions regarding it
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise i would think that either it
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
could be a quick conditional approval
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
just to get it into formatting with the
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
manual it shouldn't be too much of a
 
01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:53.270 align:start position:0%
manual it shouldn't be too much of a
problem

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
i moved to conditionally approve the
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
rule with the formatting change
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
and also with the note that the fists
 
01:17:02.239 --> 01:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
and also with the note that the fists
should

01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
have mentioned that tax rate change
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
which is due to the
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
seeing done all those in favor aye aye
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
and before moving on from this rule
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
there was just a couple more comments um
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
a1 and a2 both reference forms
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
and it's unclear
 
01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.149 align:start position:0%
and it's unclear
about

01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
what these forms are and where one could
 
01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.910 align:start position:0%
what these forms are and where one could
find

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
the first form as that part was deleted
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the rule
 
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
in the rule
um

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
and additionally oil uh staff did not
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
receive copies of these forms so we were
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
yes so we saw uh
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
the 705.01 was not drafted correctly
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately so we have brought with us
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
your replacement language for that and i
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
9c interest and dividends tax
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me mr chair we should probably
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
amend the motion to address whatever
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
changes are coming around
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
i mean we're accepting a conditional
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
we have a motion to amend the previous
 
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
we have a motion to amend the previous
motion

01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
by mcguire second by schmidt
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:18:58.159 --> 01:18:59.590 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
i

01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
opposed the motion amendment carries to
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
so in my handout is the suggested
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
replacement language for 705.01
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the concern was on
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
a1 and a2
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
and in a1 the the form meals and rentals
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
tax license application
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
an electronic form that's available on
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
our gtc so gtc is the new uh web portal
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
that has been established through the
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
rim system
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you this is very clear and we've
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
already approved it
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh so um
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
20 22 87 has to do with the interest and
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
dividends tax um this particular rule is
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
before the committee because it's set to
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
expire in october so it's just a
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
readoption with some edits
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
however there were a couple of
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
notes from staff with regard to
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
this particular rule as well once again
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
there is a um
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
no before i get to that the first note
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
to jail car is just an explanatory note
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to do with the substance
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the rule just simply explaining
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
the principal concern with the ownership
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.159 --> 01:20:30.229 align:start position:0%
 
between

01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:31.189 align:start position:0%
between
rev

01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
rev
 
01:20:31.199 --> 01:20:32.030 align:start position:0%
rev
uh

01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
moving along uh the the major
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
comment with this particular rule
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
the comment can be found on revenues
 
01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.750 align:start position:0%
the comment can be found on revenues
902.01

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
902.01
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
however it does
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
carry throughout the rest of the rule
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
the agency continues to or throughout
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
the rule uses the word individual in
 
01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.070 align:start position:0%
the rule uses the word individual in
person

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
and seems to
 
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
and seems to
switch

01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
switch
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
without giving a definition of what an
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
individual is versus what a person is
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
and both the new hampshire law and the
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
federal law both
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
define an
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
person and individual differently
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
the federal law 26
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
usc section 7701 defines a person as an
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
individual a trust estate partnership
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
association company or corporation
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then even within the agency's own
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
rules revenue 901.06 defines a
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
corporation as an artificial person
 
01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
corporation as an artificial person
and

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
revenue 901.016
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
includes in its definition a part of a
 
01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.510 align:start position:0%
includes in its definition a part of a
year

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
definition for a part year resident as a
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
person but does not use the word
 
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.350 align:start position:0%
person but does not use the word
individual

01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.709 align:start position:0%
individual
so

01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's unclear
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
what is considered an individual and
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
what's considered a person throughout
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the rules and when it applies to an
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
individual or when it applies to a
 
01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.470 align:start position:0%
individual or when it applies to a
person

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
so i i did some research once again
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
these are rules that are not
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
being updated with this current
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
submission these are older rules
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
and um i do want to point out that ind
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
is phasing out and will be repealed in
 
01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.669 align:start position:0%
is phasing out and will be repealed in
2027

01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
2027
 
01:22:27.679 --> 01:22:28.470 align:start position:0%
2027
um

01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
and according to my res my research is
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
that there is a definition for persons
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire statute
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that is in rsa 21 total 9
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it's the the word person may extend
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
and be applied to bodies corporate and
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
politics as well as to individuals so
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
the the the term persons is more more
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
encompassing as as to individuals there
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
is a definition it's not um
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is not referenced in the 900 rule
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's something that's in the statute i
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
so if if it is defined in statute and
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
the agency plans on using that statutory
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
definition i would just recommend that
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's reference
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
within the rule just to make that clear
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
of what a person is but once again it's
 
01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:21.830 align:start position:0%
of what a person is but once again it's
still

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
still
um

01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
is unclear of what is being considered
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
as an individual within these rules
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
individual would be
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
as an individual um it's
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
and reference referring to 90201 the the
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
way that the rev rule is written
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
how uh in terms of maintaining a home
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
living quarters um
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
being present in new hampshire having
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
family living in new hampshire
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
so that all that referencing for an

other business pharmacy board yes sir so

um this is on here to give the committee
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
an update
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
so what you have linked is the
 
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.350 align:start position:0%
so what you have linked is the
proposal

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
2021-92 which contained the pharmacy 700
 
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.030 align:start position:0%
2021-92 which contained the pharmacy 700
rules

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.550 align:start position:0%
rules
and

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
we linked that so you could see what it
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
looked like whenever it came through
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
on may 20th it was approved
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
conditionally approved with a
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the board
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
work with us to identify any conflicts
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
due to the removal of certain
 
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.229 align:start position:0%
due to the removal of certain
requirements

01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:26:48.239 --> 01:26:49.590 align:start position:0%
requirements
and

01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
and for me to make any kind of
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations for um rule making to
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
address those concerns
 
01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.030 align:start position:0%
address those concerns
um

01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
broadly there were just there were three
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
areas of concern one was that the
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
statute requires registration of
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacy interns including requirements
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
for supervision and those had been
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
removed from the rules
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
the statute also requires the adoption
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
of protocols and procedures for
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
temporary absence of the pharmacist in
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
charge from the pharmacy and then there
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
were potentially some problems between
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy 700s and the pharmacy 300
 
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy 700s and the pharmacy 300
roles

01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
roles
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
so subsequent to um
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
to that recommendation or to that
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
conditional approval the um the board
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
has adopted these rules
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
and um you'll see also linked on the
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
agenda some testimony from mr stout who
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
is a former chair of the pharmacy board
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
expressing concerns specifically about
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
the lack of language in the rule around
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
the policies and protocols for the
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
absence of the pharmac in charge from
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
so i've met several times with tina
 
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.629 align:start position:0%
so i've met several times with tina
kelly

01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
kelly
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
on these rules and on these three broad
 
01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
on these rules and on these three broad
concerns

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
and next month i'll be making a formal
 
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.709 align:start position:0%
and next month i'll be making a formal
recommendation

01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the committee do a petition for
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking specifically on
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
that section that requires some
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
protocols and procedures for the
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
temporary absence of the pharmacist
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
may also include a couple of other areas
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
but wanted to wait for the board to meet
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
and they met yesterday
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
and they formed a subcommittee which i'm
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure tina can talk about and they're
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at some of the other
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
areas the deficiencies that that we've
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
pointed out
and

01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
figure out if they've been addressed in
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
other rules
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
or what they plan on doing um to address
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
those concerns like i said it will come
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
up in front of the committee next month
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a um a formal petition
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
ready for you to to vote on
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%

01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
created a committee before that
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is going to be one of the things
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
that they're going to take up at that
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
rules committee
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
to go over that i it's it's a very new
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee so i'm not sure when they're
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
meeting next
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%

but they're going they're going to
address

01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
where all of the items for registration
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
of pharmacies are included in the rules
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
and if not how to move forward to get
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
those things into the rules
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
um they're going to beef up the adoption
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
of protocols and procedures for
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
temporary absence of a pharmacist
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then cleaning up the 300s that
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
address the 700s and all of that has
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
changed so i've i've given all that to
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
to work on and to come back with
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
how they plan to
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
proceed okay
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no other business will
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
