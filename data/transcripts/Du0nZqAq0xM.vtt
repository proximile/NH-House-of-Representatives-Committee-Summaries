00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh it's 2 36.
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
um we we said that we would convene a
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
joint work session on division one and
 
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
division two uh or excuse me division
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
one and division three to uh talk about
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
HB 49
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
um HP 49 uh
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
started its life as a as a bill that was
 
00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:16.610 align:start position:0%
started its life as a as a bill that was
intended

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.430 align:start position:0%
intended
to

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
merely extend the the deadline for the
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
closure of the sununu center through the
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year and throw some
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
money at it HP 49 became overcome by
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
events as we passed sb1 as amended last
 
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.730 align:start position:0%
events as we passed sb1 as amended last
week

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:43.819 align:start position:0%
and so 49 has now become a vehicle
 
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:48.380 align:start position:0%
to essentially take what we did in sb1
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's now law the governor's already
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
signed it and then take the other
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
elements of sb1
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
um that has been worked on for a couple
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
of years now
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
and and and basically interleave it so
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
that by the time
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
SB 49 if if it passes with this
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
amendment it will have completed a
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
two-piece puzzle and we'll have we'll
 
00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:15.979 align:start position:0%
have sb1
 
00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
have sb1
reincarnated

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
reincarnated
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
and sb1 as you may know was past 24 to
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
nothing by the Senate
 
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
and the the big Hang-Ups on getting it
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
passed in the last two years has been a
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
disagreement a principal disagreement
 
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.969 align:start position:0%
disagreement a principal disagreement
between

00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:36.979 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
people over the capacity issue
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
the capacity issue has been put in the
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
parking lot and you'll see it in the
 
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.710 align:start position:0%
parking lot and you'll see it in the
amendment

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
by an idea to have
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
decide evaluation that's already in law
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
and and in this amendment put into the
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
architectural designs
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of two scenarios two options
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
one option on the capacity is six to
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
twelve the other option on capacity is
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
an operational capacity of 12 with a
 
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:23.300 align:start position:0%
potential physical capacity of up to 18
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
to handle exigent reasons uh you know so
 
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:31.700 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
that it is not
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
Services who decides who goes to the
 
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:42.380 align:start position:0%
sununu center it's the judicial system
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh and so the DHHS receives the
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
requirement to um to detain these
 
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.050 align:start position:0%
requirement to um to detain these
individuals

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.060 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
from court orders and and then is
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
obligated to provide services so uh so
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
how many I need I know division three is
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat familiar with the whole sununu
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
Center issue but this is the first time
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
we've had division one here and I'm just
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
curious of the division one folks
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
how many of you are completely new to
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
the whole sununu Center where you don't
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand where you I don't mean to say
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
don't understand but but you haven't yet
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to understand what
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
the community has been working on for
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
two years that this is kind of your
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
first blush at the idea representative
 
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.630 align:start position:0%
first blush at the idea representative
Sweeney

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
Sweeney
 
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:38.459 align:start position:0%
kind of a little I've obviously read up
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
on the dealings in the legislature that
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
have faced it but this would be my first
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
time on a committee task with the with
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
the center all right
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
um and I I I won't call you each out but
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin representative
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
evil well you're you're such a young guy
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
I figured you got time to heal if I
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
wound you so uh
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative evil your name's upside
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
down I don't know if that means you're
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
or have have either of you uh been had
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
cause to understand what the issues are
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
all right super and then uh
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Cambray
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I I know about the issue but I don't
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
have the level of detail that I would
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
need to make decisions okay
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt McGuire
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt you probably have
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
sent kids there yeah right I'm I'm
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
familiar with the whole situation all
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
right yeah I've never visited the
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
existing Center so I I guess I don't
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
know exactly what's wrong with it it's
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
except that horrible things happened
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
there right we heard today from the
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
Judiciary there's a thousand cases
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
involved I mean on the um on the on the
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh a thousand court cases right yeah
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
well I we saw 640 earlier today but um
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative leishman when we talked
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
you you you said that maybe I should
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
chair this but I want you to feel like
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're co-chairing it do you have any
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
comments for us before we kick off
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
I'm fairly familiar with the situation I
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
have visited the facility so I have a
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.949 align:start position:0%
um
let's

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
let's address the first thing before we
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
get into the amendment itself I'm going
 
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
to ask Mr Ripple this is hot off the
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
presses uh from OLS so I've not really
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
had to look at it yet but let's have Mr
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
ribson come up
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
and you you've now got a sense of your
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
audience you know what we know you kind
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
of know what we don't know why don't why
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
don't you give us sort of the big
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
picture sweeping uh view of of of of
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
what's going on why over the last two
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
sure good afternoon everybody Joe ripsom
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
director dcyf
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I know that I passed these out a week
 
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
or so ago do does do folks still have
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
these would it be helpful to have a new
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
copy of these for anybody yes
 
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.949 align:start position:0%
copy of these for anybody yes
just

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
for those of you who have these you'll
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
notice that the the color is getting
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
more faded
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
every time I print it I think we're
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
so again thank you thanks Kevin uh Joe
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
ripson director dcyf
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
um what you have in front of you is the
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
census data on the first page from sysc
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
so this is actually the daily census
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
every day from
 
00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:33.019 align:start position:0%
July 2016 through the present
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see here right 2016 2017 you know
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
hitting 70 75 at a peak you do see a
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
major decline happening in like 2018
 
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
um that aligns with uh two things that
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
are happening one changes in law as to
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
who could be detained and committed at
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
and changes in a new emerging system of
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
care to be able to treat youth in other
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
settings in other ways and back in their
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
community so those two things are
 
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019 align:start position:0%
happening at once and they result in
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
what I think is a a great story of our
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
ability to reduce the use of detention
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
and commitment for young people in New
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to a point where really other
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
than kind of this first you know six
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
months of 2020
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
um always under 20.
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
the average daily census really for the
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
past almost three years has been 12 but
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
on any given day the census has been as
 
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
low as five and as high as 18. so those
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
are kind of your high water marks and
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
your low water marks but the average has
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
really stabilized around 12 during that
 
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.829 align:start position:0%
really stabilized around 12 during that
period

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
and I will pause for a minute to see
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
folks have questions about the sysc
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
census in particular before I move on to
 
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.490 align:start position:0%
census in particular before I move on to
the

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
um to me the the orange line Looks
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
relatively flat over this whole period
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
which means I guess that
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
um the crimes being committed is
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
relatively constant right and then
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
people are detained when they commit
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
such a crime yes yeah so the I I think
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
when I look at it to me actually it
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
looks like you have some pretty big
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
variation on both the orange and the
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
blue right even though they're you know
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
you're looking between
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
you know five or fewer up to you know 12
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
or so you know in terms of a percentage
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the total right you kind of have
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
variability of you know 50 in there on
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
any given day where you could have the
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
Orange Line being your detained kids you
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
know you could have less than five to
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
ten kids on a given day or we have had
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
at our Peaks here you know 12 13
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
detained kids on a given day that's the
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
Orange Line the blue line is your
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
committed kids and I think similarly
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
right where where you see you know that
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
number jumps up and down it's a little
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
more stable on the committed side than
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
the detained side and that's because
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
what I think a difference between the
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
way that the systems work for those
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
levels are a detained kid is typically
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
immediately after an incident law
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
enforcement arrests them there's some
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
immediate concern for Community safety
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
they're ordering that goes to a judge
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
judge orders detention a committed kid
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
is then after they go through that
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
process and the Court's making a
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
determination they committed whatever
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
offense that they're charged with
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
committing and that being committed to
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
sysc is the appropriate
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
um immediate result of that
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
so you know because the committed system
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
moves more slowly than the detained
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
system it's a little less volatile but I
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
both really I think do move around quite
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
a bit within that you know okay 30 to 12
 
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.130 align:start position:0%
a bit within that you know okay 30 to 12
range

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you so so essentially but
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
to me the the committed line declined
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
until we hit 2020 and then it's
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
relatively flat similar to the detained
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
line all right and if you look at the
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2020 there was a peak of 25
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
on a particular day right because look
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
at what happened to the both the
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
committed and the detained lines they
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
both peaked in their little way correct
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
at the same day and that caused a peak
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
on the total right correct so but but I
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't see any particular pattern from
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
that point on until where we are today
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
over the next those three years right so
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
to me just because the two haven't
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
peaked together doesn't mean they can't
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
Peak together and therefore we can't hit
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
another 25. I think there's I think
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's that is a risk that that exists
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know when when you talk about
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
um you know the the size of the facility
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
moving forward I would say you know what
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
we've seen again for the past three
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
years is that we haven't crossed 18 but
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
for that period
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and you know things have kind of
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
been able to wash out in a way that
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it works but there is
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
always a risk right that you know if you
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
build something that it's not quite the
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
right size and I think that's one of the
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
reasons why you know we're a little
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
cautious about
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
um going much smaller than the data
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
suggests the current trending of data
 
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.570 align:start position:0%
suggests the current trending of data
suggests

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:16.580 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative who you have your mic on
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
I do thank you
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
um you're referencing 18
 
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:27.380 align:start position:0%
um is 18 the early January February 2020
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
timeline or was that one of the points
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
between July 20 2020 and now actually
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
the the time that we hit 18 New
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kids was actually in
 
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
I believe late January of this year so
 
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
that it was after the after this chart
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
shows oh okay thank you yep
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
so so because you you mentioned the risk
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
of under capacity would would you would
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
you tell us what the plan would be I
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
mean right now we have a much larger
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
facility right so there's probably some
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
room to maneuver in the 144 book bed you
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
know monstrosity we have over there but
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
if if we do get down to a smaller
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
capacity what do we do with any
 
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
capacity what do we do with any
additional

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
kids beyond that point yeah so you have
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
under current law the ability to use
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
what's called an administrative release
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
process for committed youth
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think I said this I don't
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
remember it was a division three hearing
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the full Committee hearing
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I have heard illegal interpretations
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
that suggest that we have that Authority
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
on the detained Youth too our own
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys have told us we don't have
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
that Authority for detained youth so we
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
don't exercise that Authority for
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
detained youth but for committed youth
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
there is a process for what's called
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
administrative release historically you
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
go back 10 15 20 years even before the
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
current sysc was built
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
um there were times where they had to
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
release because they reached fire code
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
capacity and they'd reduced the census
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
by using this so-called administrative
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
release process what we use it for today
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
is we look at the youth Who We Believe
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
who've been commit who are committed but
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
who have made the clinical progress
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to allow them to safely step
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
down either back to their Community or
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
to a lower intensity setting
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the process that we would use
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
to move kids out so
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
the only exit the only option that we
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
have really to to kind of address that
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
situation would be to use that
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
administrative release process currently
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
so if you were to exceed 18 that's the
 
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
process we'd have to look at which right
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
now is for committed youth at least
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's how it's exercise and how I've
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
been how it's been explained to me for
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
committed youth only
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
so so in the worst case scenario if you
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
have no
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
kids who are under a committed status
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
none of them can can be honestly
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
evaluated to have sufficiently passed
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
through the clinical phases of of the of
 
00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:58.820 align:start position:0%
the interactions then what do you do
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
we'd be going back to court and begging
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
for Relief there's not really another
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
option what would that relief look like
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
for a judge to change their mind about
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
detaining a kid
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right and and then if you could
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
just lean into your microphone a little
 
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:14.450 align:start position:0%
just lean into your microphone a little
bit

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
thanks all right are there any other
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
questions do you do you have more to say
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
I think about the history go ahead yep
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
so um again if we look at the next page
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick on this because it's not
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
so directly related to the senses of
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
sysc and I think I explained this last
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
time but the next page this is all of
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
the youth in the Juvenile Justice System
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
who are in residential care other than
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
sysa right so if they're if they're at a
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
facility a private residential facility
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
other than sysc and what I would say
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
about this what I think this story this
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
tells is that the system of care is
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
having an impact on youth entering the
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system and having to
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
enter out of home care whether it's sysc
 
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
or residential and the reason I say that
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
is if the only thing that changed was
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
the laws around who could be committed
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
or detained I would have expected to see
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
those youth who were going to sysc show
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
up at a residential program at a
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
privatized residential program but
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's actually not what we see you do
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
see at the start of 2018 when the laws
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
first changed a bit of a jump of Youth
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
going into residential programs and then
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
you see a sustained decline over time
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
and what's really happening there is I
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
think told by the next page
 
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
so the next page is data on the flagship
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
program of our system of care
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
so our system of care for folks who
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
aren't particularly familiar with all of
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
this this is our children's Behavioral
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
Health System really started maybe
 
00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:42.419 align:start position:0%
starting in its infancy seven or so
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
years ago but got a real Boost from from
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
the legislature from you know supportive
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
both parties support of the governor to
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
really build a robust children's
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system in this state
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
and their Flagship program is something
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
called a fast forward that's what we
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
call a high fidelity wrap-around program
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
where you have a care manager that care
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
manager is a clinical person they pull
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
together a team on a monthly basis to
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
work with the youth themselves the
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
parents anybody else who's important in
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
that kid's life so if they're involved
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
in Juvenile Justice their probation
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
officer would be there if they're
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
involved in child protection their child
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
protection worker would be there the
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
schools any treatment providers
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else and they work together to
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
try to plan around how do you keep this
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
kid safe stable and getting the care
 
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
they need within their home within their
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
Community within their school
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
um that's been I think a huge success
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
and has been kind of the driver behind
 
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
why we've seen at the same time the
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
reductions at sysc you've also seen
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
reductions in the residential system as
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
a whole if we flip back to the prior
 
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.789 align:start position:0%
a whole if we flip back to the prior
page

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
I do just want to say that I am a little
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
bit cautious when I'm sharing this ad
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
about residential placements that when
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the kind of 2122 data I
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
think that is a little bit artificially
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
suppressed right now based on lack of
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
access because our residential programs
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
are not operating at full capacity
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
because of Workforce issues so I just I
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
don't want folks to get the impression
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
that this is kind of Recon this is the
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
new the new normal or the new status quo
 
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's probably underrepresentative of
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
need right now because again we have
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
access issues as a result of Workforce
 
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.669 align:start position:0%
access issues as a result of Workforce
issues

00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
um so anyway that's kind of the big
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
story about what's been happening with
 
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.649 align:start position:0%
story about what's been happening with
kids

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
um involved in the juvenile justice
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
system and
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
um ultimately ending up at sysc we also
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
have a few other really big efforts
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
um that I'll I'll probably go into more
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
deeply when we have our budget hearing
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
in a week or so
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
um that I don't need to spend a whole
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
lot of time here but it does involve Us
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
Now using a formalized assessment
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
process whenever kids come into contact
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement and US using that
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
process to re-divert and direct kids at
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
that first moment of contact with law
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement instead of waiting for court
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
involvement to happen and through that
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
process we're seeing the majority of
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
kids who access that program close to 75
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
percent be diverted away from court in
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
the first instance so all of these
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
things do point to I think in the long
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
run we will likely continue to see
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
decreases but it's hard for me to
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
predict exactly what that is and I think
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
what um the one thing that I would like
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
to remind folks of I've said it here I
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
know in division three I'm not sure in
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
the others and I think I have copies of
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
the report here for people that want it
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
but that we according to a recent
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
National report already have the lowest
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
combined rate of detained and committed
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
kids in the country
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at you know are
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
you talking about capacity for 18 or
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
capacity for 12 or capacity for six
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of national
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
precedence for other states being able
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
to get a lot lower than we currently are
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
so I do you know I do want us to be
 
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
cautious and thoughtful about where we
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
currently are and uh where we think this
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
system is going to go representative
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
Waller has a question sure thank you
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
know for a long time I've been a
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
supporter of being sure that as few
 
00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
children as possible are in this
 
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.590 align:start position:0%
children as possible are in this
facility

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.430 align:start position:0%
facility
um

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons I you know feel
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
that children do better when they're in
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
their own Community or not taken out of
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
their community
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
what other initiatives
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
have read through this
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
what other initiatives could we
 
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.990 align:start position:0%
what other initiatives could we
include

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
in this piece of legislation it feels
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
like to me this piece of legislation is
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
lacking in that it does not include a
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
look at any other ways of reducing the
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
census there
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
um we've a couple of us have come to you
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
with some suggestions the last you know
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks and
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
um for whatever reasons those those
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions don't work I don't quite
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
understand why but they don't and I
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
would just like to know what else can we
 
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.890 align:start position:0%
would just like to know what else can we
do

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this census is as low
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
as we can get it yeah I think I think
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's a few things that are really
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
really important I think one thing
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's really important is continued
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
work on and support of the system of
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
care and actually having to be able to
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
reach full capacity and who it serves
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
right now it's not able to reach full
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
capacity for the same Workforce issues
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
that we have and there's a specific
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
program within the system of care called
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
Trek which is Transitional residential
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
enhanced care coordination but
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
essentially it's the same program as
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
fast forward is except for those youth
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
who are in out of home care who are in
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
residential programming or sysa we do
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
prioritize the sysc population for that
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
program right now but the same kids that
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
are in residential care across the state
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
are the same ones that ultimately often
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
end up at sysc because they have
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
challenges within their residential
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
programming and I think having that High
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
Fidelity wrap around available for them
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
is really really important having that
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
available throughout their full episode
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
of out of home care right now the
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
challenges with that are really around
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues right the inability to
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
hire enough clinicians to manage the
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
whole volume I do have a prioritized
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
needs request in the budget
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
coming forward that I'm sure division
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
three will look at when we meet next
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
week that includes a request for some
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
funding for localized Juvenile Diversion
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
programs when we look at the data
 
00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:18.419 align:start position:0%
through the needs assessment process
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
that we're doing there's a couple places
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
where we're falling short in our ability
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
to connect young people to the services
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
they need that we think would keep them
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
out of the system those two places in
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
addition to Trek that I just talked
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
about are Juvenile Diversion programs so
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
a Juvenile Diversion programs do is that
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're local they're not funded by the
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
state right now they're funded
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
exclusively locally so you have some
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
communities who are who provide a lot of
 
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
support in this area you have other
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
parts of the state that don't and now
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
that we're doing an assessment and
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
recognizing that these kids have a need
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
for this type of intervention we're
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
finding gaps for kids to be able to
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
access that type of intervention and
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
what they do is they use a restorative
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
justice model to work with the young
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
people around understanding the harm
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
that they caused through their actions
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
working with victims to come up with a
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
plan for how to make that victim whole
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
so they feel like they've been heard and
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
supported and and you know come to a
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
resolution that that solves what their
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
issue is and then help prevent then they
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
help those young people implement the
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
plans to help make those victims whole
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the key piece of what a
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
juvenile diversion program does on top
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
of that they do some other kind of case
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
management connection work to support
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
young people that type of program works
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
really really well for a certain subset
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
of young people it's not this solution
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
for every young person right if you have
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
a young person with severe behavioral
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
health challenges that would qualify for
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
like a fast forward program a diversion
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
program might be a nice thing to have
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to solve their
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
underlying mental health issues the
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
other place we're having real real
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
challenges which I'm sure is not going
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be of any surprise to anybody is
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
access to individualized counseling
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
services or more of that outpatient
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
level care for Young Folks so when those
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
kids go through our assessment process
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
if they're not at a high enough level to
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
require say a fast forward intervention
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
that high moderate level intervention
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
but just need a counselor to speak to
 
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:00.059 align:start position:0%
right now we're having a very very hard
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
time accessing those Services Community
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers have very very
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
long wait lists for those Services a lot
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
of private providers have decided to
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
move into a private pay only space which
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
has made it really really difficult for
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
many of our families to to access that
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I think if you want to think about
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
and talk about how do we kind of keep
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
keep kids out of the system
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
we've actually built I think a really
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
Forward Thinking approach to identifying
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
those needs and driving those kids to
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
those needs but we're having some gaps
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
in actually Meeting those needs and
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
those are kind of the two key places
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
so what I'm wondering is are there any
 
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.950 align:start position:0%
so what I'm wondering is are there any
children

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.810 align:start position:0%
children
presently

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
presently
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
that uh come to the center that are sent
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
to the center that you think really
 
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.289 align:start position:0%
to the center that you think really
could

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
yeah that happens it happens sometimes
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
on a detained stat on a detained status
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
where they come in and sometimes a
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
committed status when they come in and
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
when that happens you know on the
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
committed status we use the
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
administrative release process to manage
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
that where we have a little bit of a
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
hold up right now is oftentimes in
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
accessing that residential care for step
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
down so if you have a child who isn't
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
maybe ready to go home but they don't
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
need to be in a secured setting our
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
residential programs are as I said
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
before really backed up right now in
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
terms of Workforce issues not operating
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
at full capacity on the detained side
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know that happens I think sometimes
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
where you know there's immediate crisis
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
an immediate issue and within 24 or 48
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
Hours the court revisits the decision
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
and then they release that young person
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
and we go into court and say hey here's
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
um you know this young person seems like
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
they're stable the family's ready to
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
take them back and and that happens so
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
you know that happens currently through
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
the court process for kind of those kids
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
that have only a couple day Long
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
do you see any other
 
00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
things we could do
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
prevent children from being committed or
 
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.649 align:start position:0%
prevent children from being committed or
detained

00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
detained
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
you know there's been efforts to look at
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
um you know what the what offenses are
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for detention and commitment
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
beyond the reductions that have already
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
been made and implemented into law
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I think it gets tricky you know there
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
was a there was a attempt to do that
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
last session and one of the things I was
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
worried about was that there was a
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
provision put into there to
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
um it was called like a Judicial
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
override or something and I was a little
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
bit worried that the application of that
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
might end up being a bigger exception
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
than the rule itself right so I think
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's we need to be really careful and
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about that to make sure that
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
it actually has the intended impact that
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
we're looking for and you know off the
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
top of my head I'm not quite sure how to
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
draw that line but you know I think
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
that's something that could be looked at
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
but is a very complicated process to
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
so oh
 
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.109 align:start position:0%
so oh
um

00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt just just to get a
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
feel for how the past is affecting the
 
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.430 align:start position:0%
feel for how the past is affecting the
present

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh to what extent do we do you have um
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
kids who are Court committed as a result
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
of a determination of a case the court
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
heard the case and committed the uh the
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
minor one of the one of the conditions
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
of that it used to be that uh the kid
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
got committed and turned 18 already went
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
but I understand that things have gotten
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
a lot better along those lines over the
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
years but to what extent do you now have
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh kids committed at the center uh as a
 
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
result of being adjudicated
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean the so the data on
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
commitment right is it's the blue line
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
on here so a big part of this drop you
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
see is a reduction in the number of
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
Youth who are committed but it also is a
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
change in the length of stay that's the
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
other big thing you're seeing here so it
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
was common for youth to be committed for
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
the minority
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
um it's no longer common in fact the way
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
that the laws are written now for most
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
offenses they're eligible for parole
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
within three months and for more serious
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
offenses within six months and it's
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
pretty typical that they're paroled
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
within that time frame so the length of
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
stays are really really substantially
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
down from what they used to be so
 
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
typically within from I think if you
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
looked at the average committed youth it
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
comes out to be about three months that
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
they're there so that's it's it's a much
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
shorter stay where you do see the long
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
term at this point is kind of your they
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
fall into the detained population the
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
way that we categorize this and those
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
are for folks young folks who are
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
charged with very serious adult crimes
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're being held pending adjudication
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
of an adult crime
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
thankfully we don't see at least I in my
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
opinion kind of and overuse of that
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
exception I know right now I'm re I get
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
clips from around the country every
 
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
morning on Juvenile Justice Maryland's
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
having a big debate where they
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of kids a year
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
they charge for adult crimes
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
um when I've seen it here it's for very
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
very serious offenses like murder
 
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
attempted murder armed robbery it's not
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
for lower level crimes that then could
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
get a kid stuck in the system
 
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
get a kid stuck in the system
indefinitely

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
indefinitely
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh oh
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman what is the
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate for those either going
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
out at the three-month window or the
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
sixth month window yeah
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have an exact rate but it
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
is higher than I'm comfortable with for
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
certain and I think that's true
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that's true for many many
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice programs around the
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
country the things that we've tried to
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
put into place to help deal with that
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
that aren't yet fully realized are
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
things like this Trek program that I was
 
00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:58.220 align:start position:0%
talking about before
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
and trying to make sure that when these
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
kids get out they're tied in with an
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
intensive evidence-based community-based
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
program something like multi-systemic
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
therapy that we were able to stand up
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
about maybe two years ago but because of
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues they're only serving
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 kids at a time right now when
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
they're contracted to be able to serve
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
like 80 kids at a time so there's some
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
efforts that are in place to try to
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
really mitigate that but we are seeing
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of those kids who go
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
out end up coming back
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
so so I want to just restate something I
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
think I've heard you say and and please
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
correct me if I've heard you wrong is
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
that um that New Hampshire should be
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
very proud of the fact that in the
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
entire nation on a per capita basis
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
we're either the lowest or second lowest
 
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
in the nation in terms of detaining or
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
committing juveniles so we're already
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
exceptionally low which sort of makes
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
one wonder you know how much lower can
 
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
we go with within the current law
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
we already have efforts to make sure
 
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
that we're only detaining the the kids
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
that need to be detained and that when
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's a potential committed kid who's
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
subject to a release that were
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
implementing those procedures and to
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
that extent of current law
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
the trend lines that you've shared with
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
us indicates
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
the success of those efforts already
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
under prospective law it's all Theory
 
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:41.339 align:start position:0%
with different schools of thought about
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
if a given change could increase or
 
00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of committed kids we
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't know it's Theory
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
but we go back to the first point this
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
is the lowest state in the nation
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
already so the opportunity for
 
00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.329 align:start position:0%
already so the opportunity for
improvement

00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
feels pretty limited that's that's my
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
takeaway from what you've said is that
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
fair or you disagree I I think that's
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
fair I I do want to say that I I still
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
do believe we can do better but I don't
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
think the way that in my opinion is the
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
way to operationalize that is not
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
through you know how many bedrooms you
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
build but through making sure that we
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
build a system that meets the needs of
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
kids rapidly quickly and prevents them
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
from getting down this path and I do
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
think you know some of the improvements
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about are things you
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
might not realize for a number of years
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
right because it's those 10 year olds
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
today who are accessing the system of
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
Care at their first episode as opposed
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
to the 16 year olds today who are
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
already so deep in the system and
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're now accessing the system of care
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
so so we're we're about to start going
 
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
through the amendment unless there are
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
questions and I I I just want to make
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
again I want to just check in with you
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm hearing you right is
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
that uh this amendment that we're going
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
to review still fully considers two
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
options a capacity of six to twelve the
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
other that has an operational plan for
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
12 people meaning you're going to staff
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
for 12 people
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
in other words we think we're going to
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
have 12 people but in the worst case
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
scenario we could go up to 18 if we
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to so we've got two plans 6 to 12
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
12 to 18. is there another range we
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at some people think
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
we could just get rid of the sununu
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
center and rely on the system of care
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
what what what would you say to that
 
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.970 align:start position:0%
what what what would you say to that
I

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any evidence
 
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:37.460 align:start position:0%
nationally of that being a viable option
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
and since I've been here we've had a
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
number of young people who commit very
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
very serious offenses and we have
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
residential programs who aren't willing
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
and able to to serve this entire
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
capacity of young people so I think you
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
know I
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
I would love to see that day come but I
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
think banking on that happening right
 
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.950 align:start position:0%
think banking on that happening right
now

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
um you know is it's a bit it's a bit too
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
much in the realm of what we'd love to
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
see and not and not what we are seeing
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
so under current law
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
we have set up the predicate that we're
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
going to continue to operate the current
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
facility in its in its current physical
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
state until there's a replacement
 
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:27.140 align:start position:0%
and so if we don't pass a replacement
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to end up forever in the
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
current facility is is that your
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we are now
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
currently that we're going to stay where
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
we're at maintain the status quo for for
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
as long as we can until we can open up a
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
replacement Center that will accept
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
these kids yes I think until and I think
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
until a decision is made about what
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
we're doing next that's that is the most
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
responsible way to deal with it okay and
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
and and so we're about to get into 49
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
but I I would like to add to those
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
points that this whole issue of delaying
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
a decision on the replacement Center is
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
is been pushing off in my view
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
the inevitable we we have to come up
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
with a replacement Center we can't come
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
up with no replacement Center the fact
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
that we have dawdled for two years has
 
00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:23.900 align:start position:0%
decimated the the workforce at sununu
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
and as a result of Workforce reductions
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
they've not been able to begin their
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
shift over to a
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed therapeutic based model
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
they're still operating in a facility
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
that was designed for incarceration and
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
because their Workforce issues they have
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
not been able to transition to the kind
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the the the the the vision of care
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we see and because we've waited two
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
years the cost of construction it seems
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
to have gone up six million dollars
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
we thought it was going to cost 15 we
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
now have estimates of 21.6
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
so in the in the in in trying to do the
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
best for these kids I think we may have
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
hurt them by delay and I I hope that we
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
can work through this amendment and find
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
a way to move forward uh yes
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative Walnut well
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to bring this up but we are
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and I wondered is
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
there anyone here to talk to us about
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
the facility how much it's going to cost
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
when it's going to how long it's going
 
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
to take the Arc of funding all of that I
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
I invited Gophers gopher here
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
gopher was unable to send anybody but we
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
do have Ted kupper from Das here to
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
speak to the cost of the facility
 
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.710 align:start position:0%
speak to the cost of the facility
okay

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
um you you can sit there or not because
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to be needed again
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh the gentleman from Das you're you're
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
welcome to join us
 
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.790 align:start position:0%
welcome to join us
um

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is yes we have some
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay and I we tried to get gopher
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
because that's critical and and we will
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
continue to Endeavor to get gopher even
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
if it's uh ad hoc in one of our other
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
work sessions
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
so at this point gentlemen do you do you
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
do you both have a copy of the amendment
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
to HP 49 because because we're going to
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
start walking through that I see several
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
advocates in the audience do you all
 
00:44:40.569 --> 00:44:40.579 align:start position:0%
have a copy of HP 49 with Amendment
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%

00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
Vice chair thinks it would be a good
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
idea for you to introduce yourself for
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
the record at this point even though we
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
haven't asked you a question yet so
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%

division of Public Works designing
construction

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh in Under the Umbrella of the
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%

engineering and Architectural office
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
that either builds new buildings for the
 
00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:35.099 align:start position:0%
state or maintains the one that they
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
already own
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
so so I don't know exactly what you do
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
but would you consider yourself a
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert on all the issues
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
related to design getting the process of
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
design done and making sure that we have
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
accurate cost estimates yes sir thank
 
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.510 align:start position:0%
accurate cost estimates yes sir thank
you

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that represent representative

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:17.180 align:start position:0%
now just to refresh your memory on that
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill won as it was passed by the
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
house and signed by the governor just a
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
week or two ago did a few things it
 
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.790 align:start position:0%
week or two ago did a few things it
removed

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
most of the text of Senate Bill 1 has
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate and replaced it
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
with a few things it repealed the
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
closure date
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
the March 1st closure date for the
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
sooner Center it appropriated operating
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
funds for the rest of this fiscal year
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
it appropriated four hundred thousand
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for site selection and it set up
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
a committee or a commission rather to
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
evaluate site selection and make that
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
and other recommendations for future
 
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.690 align:start position:0%
and other recommendations for future
legislation

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
undo any of that but it does revive some
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
of the language from Senate bill one as
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate in modified form so
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
I'll walk through this briefly now
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
drawing special attention to the areas
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
where it differs from Senate bill one as
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
section one contains a statement of
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
findings and there is some new language
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
in there on lines 11 through 13 that
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
reads placement of children in
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
Correctional settings outside of the
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
state undermines the stabilization and
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
return to productive members to the
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
communities that is new and was not
 
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
section 2 requires HHS to construct a
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
replacement facility for the sununu
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
center The Language online 17 through 21
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
is new and states that the capacity of
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
the facility shall be determined by
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
demographic and other factors also new
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
on line 21 it states a smaller facility
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
of 6 to 12 residents shall be fully and
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the first page I
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
believe is the same as the bill that was
 
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
as you go on to page two
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
it talks about the design elements of
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
the facility that is largely the same as
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate passed version of house bill
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
one but there is some new language on
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
lines 13 and 14 again it states an
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
alternative plan shall be developed to
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
equally and fully evaluate a physical
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
and operational plan ranging from 6 to
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
12 beds in Residence
 
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:30.980 align:start position:0%
also new is the language online's 21-23
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
which states that operations May utilize
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
the programming and operational
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
requirements the start on line 24 is
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
largely the same as the Senate passed
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
version of Senate bill 1.
 
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
as is most of Page Three however there
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a difference down near the bottom of
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
page three Senate Bill 1 referenced a
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
completion date for the new facility of
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2024
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
this bill or this amendment removes that
 
00:49:02.819 --> 00:49:04.190 align:start position:0%
this bill or this amendment removes that
date

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
and a few different in a few different
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
replaces and simply refers to an
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
accepted completion deadline for the
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
facility so it does not include a
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
Section 3 which begins on line 14 does
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
amend a small portion of Senate Bill 1
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
that was passed by the house signed by
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
the governor and has been codified into
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
law that required HHS to procure a
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
qualified architect on or before March
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 this changes that to within 60
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
days of the effective date of this
 
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.450 align:start position:0%
days of the effective date of this
legislation

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
and on lines 20-21
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
it adds that the proposals for a
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
contractor shall be on a timeline
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the use of federal arpa funds
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
the final difference is in the
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation section that begins on
 
00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:08.339 align:start position:0%
line 34 Senate Bill 1 as passed by the
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
Senate originally contained a 15 million
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation this committee
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
heard from Das that the total cost of
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
design and construction would be in the
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 21.6 million dollars so
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes that appropriation
 
00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:24.050 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes that appropriation
instead

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
and on page five it emphasizes that arpa
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
funds shall be used first with any
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:36.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:37.130 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that
[Music]

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:37.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
I think in the version I wrote I
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
I said something oh wait so this is new
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
I think people need to see this on page
 
00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:49.430 align:start position:0%
I think people need to see this on page
four

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
line eight through ten
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
we we had division three a lot of debate
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
on what the proper mechanism would be
 
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
for making an actual decision on which
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
you know on the site location and on the
 
00:51:06.119 --> 00:51:07.690 align:start position:0%
you know on the site location and on the
uh

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:07.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
capacity and so lines 8 through 10
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
essentially charge the governor and
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
council with with using the information
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
from the commission and exercising their
 
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.870 align:start position:0%
from the commission and exercising their
discretion

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.150 align:start position:0%
discretion
so

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
is it do you think that's all the
 
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.329 align:start position:0%
is it do you think that's all the
changes

00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
I believe so and you're right I had
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
marked up those lines as new and then I
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
skipped right over them uh
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney you have a
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I just want
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
to highlight on page two at the top
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
there this I think this is very
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
important and it needs to be said that
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
the name Will Change we're talking about
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
complete and overvamp of this for
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
various reasons but the name Will Change
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
taking off the word sununu and just
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
being known as the Youth Development
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
Center I think that's exceedingly
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
important as we move forward thank you
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh to that I I would actually be hoping
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
that a group of activists and community
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
members would spend some time in the
 
00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:09.500 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
identifying who what this thing should
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
be called I mean we've got plenty of
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
years to build this there's still an
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to name it properly I think
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
the honorable Kim rice had suggested a
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
different name than YDC because that's
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
not very interesting so so I I think
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
there's time to actually come up with
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
the an appropriate name even
 
00:52:31.619 --> 00:52:33.530 align:start position:0%
the an appropriate name even
so

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
all right representative stream
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
and you know I might get crossed between
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
some of the Amendments that we were
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
working on uh before uh passing sb1a but
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
um uh what feels a little bit different
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
was you know at some point we were going
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
to have two complete architectural uh
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
layouts at 6 to 12 and 12 to 18. uh you
 
00:52:59.530 --> 00:52:59.540 align:start position:0%
know where things would be compared and
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
costs and shared savings and so on uh
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
and um to me it feels a little bit
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
different that that the control of the
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
decision at that point is is strictly up
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
to the administration and and you know
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go back to the legislature
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
for a decision on which size of um of
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
new facility uh is the um
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
um the best one for our state okay okay
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong but I just want to throw
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
that no no no no no it's fair fair
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
observation I'll I'll address uh that
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
um if you look at first I'd say to your
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
point about whether or not we're
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
honoring the capacity
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
compromise that we made in the amendment
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
to sb1 this fully respects that capacity
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
compromise I think in two locations
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see that online
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
20 well first even before getting into
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
that keep in mind that sb1 is now
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
statute sb1 has has said that there
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
shall be two options for site evaluation
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
six to twelve and 12 to 18 right so now
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking past site evaluation and
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
into design and then in the build right
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
so the design part of it is on line 21
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
where it says a smaller facility a 6 to
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
12 residents shall be fully and equally
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
evaluated that's intended to to honor
 
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:32.420 align:start position:0%
the compromise
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
and then on page two lines 13 and 14
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh and an alternative plan shall be
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
developed equally and fully evaluate a
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
physical and operational plan ranging
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
from 6 to 12 beds in Residence so so
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
to your first point I think we've done
 
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:55.700 align:start position:0%
that that's in there
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
and then to your your second point which
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
I I take is
 
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
I I take is
um

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:05.660 align:start position:0%
you know this this statute on
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
page where was I was just there
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
on page four lines eight through ten yes
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's I I try to draw people's attention
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
to that that is new now keep in mind the
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
legislature we we in division three
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
weren't able to come to any sort of
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
agreement we didn't even really make any
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
progress on talking about how how this
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
decision should be reviewed and made by
 
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:35.180 align:start position:0%
the legislature there was no proposal
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
verbally there's not been an amendment
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
put forward on how to do that and so uh
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind as I as I drafted the
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that I recognize that the
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislature has failed to make a
 
00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:53.059 align:start position:0%
decision in over two years
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we needed to put this at a point
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
where a decision can be made and it'd be
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
accountable Now by saying the governor
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know the governor's obviously the
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
head of the executive branch and is
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for the dcyf mission but he
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
or she can't do it without the council
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
and the council represents an elected
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
representative body of the state so it's
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
not like it's being taken out of the
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
hands of the elected representative body
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
it just is Shifting which body because
 
00:56:29.809 --> 00:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
this body has not been able to act
 
00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:33.109 align:start position:0%
this body has not been able to act
so

00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
well under your leadership and and the
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
full committee I'm sure we can
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
I I hope is are there any comments
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.809 align:start position:0%
this amendment
so

00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
so let's uh Mr I'm sorry is our hand oh
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's hard to see you down
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
there did you representative Hewitt did
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
oh representative McGuire did go ahead
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
my division knows how funny all right
 
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.069 align:start position:0%
my division knows how funny all right
anyways

00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:06.109 align:start position:0%
anyways
um

00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
in Senate bill one has passed there was
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
site evaluation right and it was going
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
to choose among several different places
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
is this premature in the sense that once
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
we know that the site is going to be X
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect the design and
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
other aspects yes
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a fair question I
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's premature I I'd say
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
that there's a tremendous amount of
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
detail in here to inform the site
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation team on what kind of facility
 
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
they they ought to be planning and and
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
and even if this were premature from
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
that standpoint I'd still say the timing
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
is necessary because the site evaluation
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
may not take place in the summer and as
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
you know the House and Senate are not
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
always in session so so we have to
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
decide while we're in session what we
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
shall do and and I think given that sb1
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
that had this kind of language in it
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
passed 24 to nothing and that the house
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
is probably divided on it that we the
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
timing is ripe I mean there's only so
 
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
many times we ought to be coming back to
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
the replacement question
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
what was the deadline in sb1 for the
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
site evaluation I don't remember I I
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't remember do you remember Mr Ripple
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh there was a September date for HHS
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
to to propose a site yes
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
and that was a not later then date
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
correct so so it could be as soon as
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
possible I mean Mr ripson I'll ask you
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
in just a second but but uh it's my
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that DHHS has a has the
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
contractor teed up and they know the
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
sites pretty well so what's your best
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
guess on on what reality is even though
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
you have till one September so we're
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
working very closely with my partner to
 
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
the left around
 
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.730 align:start position:0%
the left around
um

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
around you know entering into a contract
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
with somebody to do the site evaluation
 
00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.789 align:start position:0%
with somebody to do the site evaluation
work

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
um realistic timeline on that Ted I
 
00:59:19.319 --> 00:59:20.329 align:start position:0%
um realistic timeline on that Ted I
don't

00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
right now uh we've talked to a
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
consultant that we have a Statewide
 
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
agreement with they're going to deliver
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
a proposal to our office this Friday
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
and we're going to give them a notice to
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
proceed and we've asked them to complete
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
their site evaluation for us by the end
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
by the end of March that's pretty good
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty quick okay is 400 000
 
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
enough or is it too way too much money
 
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
yes sir four hundred thousand is
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
adequate for that all right
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
and I have to all right so another
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
detail on page one line 16.
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so this document this amendment has
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible to construct the
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
facility so with the assistance of Das
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if it maybe ought to
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
be backwards the other way around so
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
that it's Das who's responsible to
 
01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.210 align:start position:0%
that it's Das who's responsible to
construct

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
construct
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
with the assistance with the input from
 
01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:24.380 align:start position:0%
HHS since Construction in general that's
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
das's bailiwick yes
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know I I I I I like what you're
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
saying okay I I would just um point out
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
two things if if you want to draft some
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
alternative language I I'd be very happy
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
to have everyone consider it
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
um but I would say that this language
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
has been vetted probably five times and
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
and you're the first brilliant person to
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out that it could be written
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
slightly differently I mean the Senate
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
passed that sentence that first sentence
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
24 to nothing did they not is that is
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
that the same sentence line 16 through
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
17 Mr Ripple
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
I believe it is yeah
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe these two gentlemen feel
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
like they work together like no problem
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's not an issue I don't
 
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:15.140 align:start position:0%
know what do you think
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
are you following the issue there Mr yes
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
sir is there a question yeah so the the
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
question is would it be would this be
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
better your responsibility to design and
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
construct this facility with input from
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
HHS as opposed to hhs's responsibility
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
to design and construct which is not
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
something they normally do I would think
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
right correct so uh normally the way we
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
proceed with capital projects
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
uh the division of Public Works is the
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
contract administrator we're in charge
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the contract to design and then
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
construct the facility
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
and the using agency is our partner
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that the legislation
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
that creates those things writes it in
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
the opposite way to this bill generally
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
I would say normally that would be
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
opposite yes thank you
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
so again if if um if that sentence is
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
important to you let's let's get an
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
alternative language and look at it
 
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.770 align:start position:0%
alternative language and look at it
because

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
all right representative Wilder I don't
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
consider the opposite way if you're
 
01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
building a house you're building a house
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
you want to tell all the things you want
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
and then the contract is going to build
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
it with your input so you don't want to
 
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
take away the input yes they can build a
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
facility but
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
they want to deal with the people that
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
know what they want exactly in the
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
facility so
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr ribson Mr Cooper cupper cupper
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
um is there additional this description
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
provided in this amendment that would
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
facilitate the people doing the site
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
evaluation or is the kind of the
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
descriptive nature of this uh kind of
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
just irrelevant and and not really
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
needed for the site evaluation to to
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
um I think everything written here is
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
adequate to evaluate the sites that we
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
have before us and make a decision about
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
selection okay so does it is this
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of informing the site
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
selection process to have this
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
in in statute or not necessarily
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
important to informing it it's just it
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
so I do think
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
having the direction of what the
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
expectation of the facility
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
to be is impactful on the site selection
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
process right so I do think that having
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in place that
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
that talks about you know things like
 
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
shared services as this does or that
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
talks about potential you know what do
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
you expect to have within your facility
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
because that then impacts the the
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
physical footprint and things like that
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's helpful to have that type
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
of clarity from the legislature to the
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
process that being said the legislation
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
that passed last time did talk about two
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
different options and we've you know
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
were able to move forward on that so I
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
guess it provides additional Clarity but
 
01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:36.059 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a prerequisite is how
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
I would put it
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you are there uh representative
 
01:04:43.569 --> 01:04:43.579 align:start position:0%
Abel evil
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
evil thank you Mr chair and um good to
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
see you Mr cupper we on public works we
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
saw him quite a bit
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I think we've talked a lot about site
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation and the effect that it might
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
have on the overall appropriation for
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
the construction and this does seek to
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate a specific amount could you
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about how much the
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
site that's ultimately chosen can affect
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
the overall appropriation how much
 
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
variation you might see or anything you
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
could share with the committee to guide
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
it would be appreciated
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.970 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think the site selection
 
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
um is important from the operational
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
sense of the facility
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't it doesn't do much for
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
uh the amount in the appropriation
 
01:05:39.299 --> 01:05:40.609 align:start position:0%
uh the amount in the appropriation
um

01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
the amount in the appropriation is going
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
to prepare a site but the but the
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
majority of the expenditure will be in
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
the design in the construction of the
 
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:51.980 align:start position:0%
building itself
 
01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.530 align:start position:0%
building itself
and

01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:53.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
typically the way engineering and
 
01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
architecture work
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
we can design a building
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
off the ground anywhere in the United
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
States of America or the state of New
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then we can place that
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
building on any site that you want it to
 
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:13.940 align:start position:0%
be placed on
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
operationally though as as Joe explained
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
um you know there are uh there are
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps operational advantages to being
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
co-located near facilities that can
 
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:31.220 align:start position:0%
prepare food
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
take care of laundry
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
um you know that sort of thing
 
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.569 align:start position:0%
um you know that sort of thing
so

01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
um I think all of the sites there's
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
three sites that we're going to evaluate
 
01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:45.770 align:start position:0%
three sites that we're going to evaluate
uh

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
they're all adequate
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
what might change the appropriation is
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
if a site chooses to renovate a building
 
01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:58.940 align:start position:0%
rather than build new construction
 
01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:02.299 align:start position:0%
and at this point I have no information
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
available to me to determine what the
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
difference might be and the cost but I
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
would think that the appropriation of
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
21.6 million dollars would be able to
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
either renovate a building or construct
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
so so Mr cupper
 
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.630 align:start position:0%
so so Mr cupper
um

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
would you do you know the history of how
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
we started at 15 million dollars in the
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
initial assessment and now we're at 21.6
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
and do you think 21.6 is the right
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
amount given that we have already
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
appropriated 400 000 for the site
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
selection process
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
so um you know just a little bit of
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
History uh when uh Health and Human
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
Services came to our division to talk
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
about this project
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
it was always about a 12 to 18 bed
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
facility that's the beginning of our
 
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.410 align:start position:0%
facility that's the beginning of our
discussion

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
and essentially what that means is an 18
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
bed facility if if you're going to have
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
um additional capacity of six beds over
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
the 12 you're really designing an 18 bed
 
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.410 align:start position:0%
the 12 you're really designing an 18 bed
facility

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
so working with Health and Human
 
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.450 align:start position:0%
so working with Health and Human
Services

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:08:29.169 --> 01:08:29.179 align:start position:0%
um our our Architects
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
started to prepare out and flesh out
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
what a facility like that might need and
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
then start putting numbers to that and
 
01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:43.580 align:start position:0%
um and for an 18 bed facility
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's always been a number of
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
about 21.6 million
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
um the 15 million that I understand came
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
from the availability of funds that
 
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
um in the in the very uh brief
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
discussions that I've had
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like 15 million was what
 
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
was available and could be provided for
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
the project I was asked at one point
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
what could we get for 15 million dollars
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
and I said we could have an adequate
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
facility to treat youth in the state of
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I can't tell you how many
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
beds that would be until we get into the
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
design though but we could certainly
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
build a facility for 15 million dollars
 
01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:34.100 align:start position:0%
would it be an 18 bed facility
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely not we don't think we can
 
01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:41.540 align:start position:0%
build an 18-bed facility for 15 million
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
and that's where the 21.6 million came
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
from from our division based on
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
preliminary you know conceptual ideas
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
about what this facility
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sweeney thank
 
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you both uh
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
questions for you director ripson on
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
page three lines 24-26 uh the Department
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services shall begin
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
to implement the programming changes uh
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether children are
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
at sysc or the new facility would that
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
require an additional appropriation for
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
your department to execute or will you
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
be able to no
 
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
um so the the changes that are really
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
discussed within the programming up here
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
are the types of kind of changes moving
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
towards a therapeutic model that we've
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
we've been working towards and hoping to
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
implement what's really become the the
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
barrier in implementation has been
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
stability of Workforce which has been
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by right the fact that
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
we had a closure date at least up until
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
last week of a week from now and um and
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
by other Workforce issues that that's
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
impacting all of our kind of residential
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
programs and everything around the state
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
so you kind of have those two things
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
that have made it impossible to move
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
forward with some of this programming in
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
the immediate term
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
um the the reason why it becomes
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
impossible in the immediate term was
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
because all of these kind of therapeutic
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
models anticipate that you're training
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
your Frontline milieu staff the ones who
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
interact with kids 24 7 365 on these new
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
models and when we have currently 17
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
youth count full-time youth counselors
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
where we need 45 ish you know you just
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the type of consistency and
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
Staffing to be able to implement those
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
programs so um so no there's not an
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
additional need for an appropriation but
 
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
I do think that you know getting Beyond
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
this point of not knowing what the
 
01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
future is is helpful and I think the
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
other thing that's helpful is coming to
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
resolution around
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
um updating the standard job
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
descriptions and the salaries for the
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
folks who work at the facility and the
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
salary component of that's being
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in two different ways one
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
through enhancements that were approved
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
by the governor and Council last year
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
that would have to be continued and then
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
two through collective bargaining that's
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
currently happening in proposals around
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
increased wages Statewide and I'm
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
hopeful that the combination of those
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
two efforts would would get us to a
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
place where our salaries are competitive
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to fill positions and
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
having the clarity of future State and a
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
vision for where we're going would get
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
us kind of over this hump that we've
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
been in around kind of the you know is
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
the facility going to close is it not
 
01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
going to close that really has been a
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
hampering our ability to hire and retain
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
staff so no I don't think we need
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
additional funding for that purpose
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
that's you know built in into the budget
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
request going into next fiscal year
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
anyway because it's always been the plan
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
for us to start to implement this work
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
but the the Practical reality of how and
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
when we do that is deeply impacted by
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
the stability of Workforce thank you
 
01:12:43.689 --> 01:12:43.699 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you Mr
 
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.890 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you Mr
chairman

01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:47.900 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:51.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm in a complete disadvantaged
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
compared to my colleagues on division
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
three so I'm going to ask you a couple
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
of specific questions uh
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
so looking at Senate bill one that we
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
amended and I believe it was unanimous
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
in this full committee which was a total
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
gutting of Senate bill one from the
 
01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
gutting of Senate bill one from the
Senate

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I've always had an opportunity to
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
read this through once and I've
 
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
underlined a number of things that I
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
think are an improvement to what we did
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
with Senate bill one is amended not to
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot but you're like the
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
expert so I like to do that
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
do you think this amendment is an
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
improvement would you agree with what I
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
S I think personally what I've read
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
again I'm at a disadvantage because my
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues on division three I've seen
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
this a lot more than I have this issue
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that I think the
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
amendment looks really good right I
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
think the key components of the future
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
state that has been worked on deeply by
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
some members of the legislature by
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
members of of the advocacy community and
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
folks that work closely with kids and
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
families by our staff by a host of other
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
people the kind of key foundational
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
elements were all within sb1 I do think
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's some language changes in here
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
that help clarify and strengthen some of
 
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
those key elements so from that
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
perspective I you know I think there's I
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
think there's good stuff in here but I
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
think the the foundational core of what
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with kids youth and
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
families within the state is really kind
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
of consistent between both thank you
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and would you like to
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
comment for a further questions I'd say
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
from an engineering perspective
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
um you know the budget that stated here
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
is probably more in line with an 18 bed
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
facility if that's what's chosen to be
 
01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.070 align:start position:0%
facility if that's what's chosen to be
built

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
um I might add that
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
um you know we we already have
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
interviewed and selected a consultant
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to help us design this new
 
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.850 align:start position:0%
that's going to help us design this new
facility

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:45.860 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're on hold right now we can't move
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
forward with their contract until
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's an appropriation for money to
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
begin that design work I think it's
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
important to note that
 
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
important to note that
um

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
we saw the importance of uh you know
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
passing sb1 in one day unanimously
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
um as a message that uh we should work
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible to get the site
 
01:15:17.169 --> 01:15:17.179 align:start position:0%
evaluation done
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
so that perhaps the legislative session
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
would still be in session and be able to
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate money like this is doing so
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't lose any more time than
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
we already have right now the consultant
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
that we've chosen
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
is revising their proposal for us and
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
and we're waiting for an appropriation
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
to bring it to governor and Council to
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
begin that work and they're looking at
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
the end of 2025 in their schedule to
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
have a new a newly constructed facility
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
if we were to be on the governor and
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
Council first meeting in May
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr chewing
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.030 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
I go go ahead representative Wallner
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
Well I this is uh off the building for a
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
minute but
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
I think lines 21 to 23 aren't did you
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
say those are those are new they weren't
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I wondered if you could comment on
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
that are those new is that a new section
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
I I wrote that and I'll tell you where
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
that came from
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
um it reads operations May utilize
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
virtual and shared services when
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
consistent with the child's education or
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
treatment plan and appropriate to
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
effectively meet the needs of a
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
particular child or children
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
now the first version of it was really
 
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:53.780 align:start position:0%
just simple it just said Opera
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
operations May utilize virtual and
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
shared services but I was in children
 
01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:01.640 align:start position:0%
and family law and one of The Advocates
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
found that particular sentence to be
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
really really important so I took the
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
language of an advocate and inserted
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
their language in there so that that's
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's that to me it didn't change the
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
concept to me it just clarified what was
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
already written and to me it was just
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
worth it to have the advocate here that
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
could you
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I turned it off
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
um would you expand on
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
what the virtual and shared services are
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
what would you oh okay so for for let's
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
let's split them up virtual is basically
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
remote right you know we we know that
 
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
through telemedicine for example and so
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
I would think that uh I I would hope
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
that the operation plan that we get back
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
would take a look at leveraging uh
 
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
telemedicine tele-education capabilities
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
to help extend the emergency staff
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's at the clinic 24x7 so that you
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
could have maybe an LPN on staff instead
 
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:17.300 align:start position:0%
of a doctor
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and that uh and that could work on on
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
education as well you know let's say you
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
get a kid with an IEP who needs some
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
specific you know Greek history from the
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
year thousand to fifteen hundred you
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
know then you could perhaps leverage
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
tele education to to bring those
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
services in that's the virtual component
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
the shared services component would be
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
if they co-located with a similar
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
facility the most valuable thing that
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
they could get from a shared services
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
agreement would be a clinical staff like
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
let's say for example they were at
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
Hampstead at Hampstead because they have
 
01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:03.500 align:start position:0%
professionals on staff that deal with
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases then they could leverage
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
some of that staff between facilities
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
for decades now hospitals have entered
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
into shared services agreements on
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
simple things like laundry so laundry
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
could be another one warehousing and
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
Logistics could be another so you know
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
helping each other out on a dining room
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
support maybe yet another so I I didn't
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
get into the Weeds on what should be
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
shared and what should be virtualized
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
because I I believe that the folks
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
working on the operational budget ought
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
I have a couple more but
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
the people that I need to ask the
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions to are not here but they're
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
around the arpa funding
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
most of the arpa funding
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
I think almost all of the arpa funding
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
that we have allocated has come through
 
01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.689 align:start position:0%
that we have allocated has come through
fiscal

01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
and this is the I think the first time
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
I've seen it come as a budget item
 
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
it through a bill so I was wondering
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
about that and maybe that's a question
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
for the LBA and then the other question
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
I have is about the use of arpa funds
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
can arpa funds be used for Correctional
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
um institutions is that an appropriate
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
use all right Mr copper answer but keep
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
in mind the bulk of that appropriation
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
language passed 24 to nothing from the
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
Senate and and uh so it it isn't that
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
the language hasn't been vetted as as
 
01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:44.420 align:start position:0%
this being an appropriate
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
vehicle but Mr cupper
 
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
I don't have any information for you on
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman about the use of arpa
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
funds Mr Ripple did you get your
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
question in there that we we should
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
research I'm sorry what was the first
 
01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:00.380 align:start position:0%
part of the question again
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative the first the first part
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
was really about whether or not
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
um we have brought any funding
 
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.689 align:start position:0%
um we have brought any funding
through

01:21:10.689 --> 01:21:10.699 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
legislation have we brought arpa funds
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
through legislation and then through the
 
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
budget or have we always been bringing
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
them off line through fiscal
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
there are bills that I believe have
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
passed that contained language similar
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
to this one appropriating arpa funds
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
first with any remainder coming from
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
General funds the bulk of Arbor funds
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
obviously have gone through fiscal I'd
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
have to take a look and see
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
which bills and what amounts have
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated arpa but I I think there
 
01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:41.900 align:start position:0%
have been some
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
represent did you have a follow-up no
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
just just the question about whether
 
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
arpa funds can actually be used for
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
that's a great specific question
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt I I want to go
 
01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:00.620 align:start position:0%
back to the uh the item on page two
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
pertain to operations uh the that
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
section is uh three the facility shall
 
01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:09.140 align:start position:0%
be designed to include
 
01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.990 align:start position:0%
be designed to include
and

01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
each of the first h
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
items are things that are included in
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
the design of the building
 
01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the operations may include virtual
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
and shared services has much to do with
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
designing the facility
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
look well for example if you're going to
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate telemedicine into the clinic
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
space the clinic space would want to be
 
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
designed so that any sort of
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
telemedicine equipment would would be
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
within that for example you know not
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
just the physical space of the equipment
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
itself but making sure that the the
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
cabling like the the CAT5 or Cat6
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
whatever we're on these days is pulled
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
inadequate for the bandwidth did we just
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
leave representative Waller he said he
 
01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
would stay until four
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
wait I hear you but I I still think that
 
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.250 align:start position:0%
wait I hear you but I I still think that
uh

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's not con it's not consistent with
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
the with the uh with the design of the
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph it probably wouldn't cause
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
much of a problem but I think we need to
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
know that we're talking about uh the way
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the place is designed and not by how
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
the people inside the building are going
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
to operate once it has once it has been
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
opened so I I think we could entertain
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
alternative language and placement I I
 
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
think it's a fact bearing on the problem
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
and it's just an issue of of where it
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
okay so at this point
 
01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:50.209 align:start position:0%
okay so at this point
um

01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
I see five people in the audience
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
um do you represent different advocacy
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
how many different groups are out there
 
01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.649 align:start position:0%
how many different groups are out there
five

01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone out there in the
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
audience who's seen this as opposed to
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
any any opposition in the crowd
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in favor of what we're
 
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
doing in the crowd I see one I see two I
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
see three I see four sir I can't see you
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson's too big
 
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
so so everyone in the crowd likes this
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
yay okay so division one would you
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
conduct a straw vote on whether we
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
should send this to
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
um finance and to the extent that
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's language that we ought to
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
consider we can consider in the full
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee representative Hewitt
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
has suggested he'd like to draft
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
something representative McGuire has
 
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
suggested he might want to draft
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
something so we I think we can take care
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
of those those are not big things
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
they're not concept issues they're
 
01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.750 align:start position:0%
they're not concept issues they're
semantics

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
so my division one members any
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
particular position or I'm sorry
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
I guess representative yeah I just I
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
guess I've never seen a process like
 
01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.370 align:start position:0%
guess I've never seen a process like
this

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
um exactly I mean we bring in some
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
people who from across the hall who all
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
of a sudden show up and they really
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't have all the background and I
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
think probably the way we usually work
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
in division is that we have some time as
 
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
a division to kind of talk to each other
 
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
about what we're thinking and where
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and it just seems like an odd process
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
to me to be having two divisions taking
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
straw polls at this point
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I think you know there's a lot of new
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
information here
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
that we you know we for the first time
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
we talked about the building we talked
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
about the appropriation so I I just I
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
just think it's
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's a little premature to be jumping in
 
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
and taking straw polls but
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that feedback and since
 
01:26:20.649 --> 01:26:20.659 align:start position:0%
division three has talked us to death
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
division one do you have a position on
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
well like I said earlier with my
 
01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:28.850 align:start position:0%
well like I said earlier with my
question

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
I personally am somewhat of a
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because I haven't had all
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
the information in the past I'm very
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
familiar with the issue of the sununu
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
center I do believe we need to move
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
forward we shouldn't be delaying this
 
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
um any longer and that's why I
 
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
specifically put my specific questions
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
to The Experts to get my reasoning for
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully moving something
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
forward if this if I saw folks in the
 
01:26:57.610 --> 01:26:57.620 align:start position:0%
audience that were opposed that
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
represent that group of people that
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're here to re represent I'd be a
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
little hesitant so I I personally don't
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
have a problem with a straw poll of our
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
division one members
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
again we're not that familiar with the
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
topic but from what I've heard today
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
so that's my position Mr chairman
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
um so do you want to conduct that straw
 
01:27:21.719 --> 01:27:25.129 align:start position:0%
um so do you want to conduct that straw
Poland

01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
are the members willing to take a straw
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
poll I know this is a different way of
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
doing things but we're living in a
 
01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.810 align:start position:0%
doing things but we're living in a
different

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
stage of the house being so close in
 
01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.729 align:start position:0%
stage of the house being so close in
numbers

01:27:36.729 --> 01:27:36.739 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Kimbrell's
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
so what would you like me to say uh no
 
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:44.649 align:start position:0%
so what would you like me to say uh no
no

01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:44.659 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
what I mean is based on what I've heard
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
here today I would feel comfortable with
 
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
moving forward and this is just moving
 
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
it forward to the full committee that's
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
not it's a recommendation if you will or
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
getting a sense of the division one
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
members I guess that's what the chair of
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
division three is apparently looking for
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
yes so I would feel comfortable moving
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
it forward to the full the full
 
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.729 align:start position:0%
it forward to the full the full
committee

01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm likewise comfortable with moving
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
forward with it to see what the division
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
two has to say and make sure that we
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
have this this thing fully under control
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
you know I I've been suffering with this
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
issue for over 30 years and uh I think
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
is it a yes that moving forward to the
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
full committee oh yes we should move
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward get the whole committee on this
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
and as I said let's do it now
 
01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.550 align:start position:0%
and as I said let's do it now
okay

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
represented Sweeney yeah I'm fine
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
getting the other third of the committee
 
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh in on this
 
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I'll just say for me personally I'm
 
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's ever been the case
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
where two options are given in
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
legislation for appropriation between 6
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
and 12 beds and 18 beds and the larger
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
isn't pursued
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's just my takeaway but I am happy
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
to hear the programmatic uh Pro parts of
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
the plan which I think are really The
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
crucial part are moving forward
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
regardless but I'm good sending it to
 
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
the whole committee representative
 
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.490 align:start position:0%
the whole committee representative
Griffin

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to move forward on the
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
sununu center solution
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
I've been through this pretty carefully
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anything in it it raises
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
a huge red flag
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
so I'd be comfortable with it going to
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
I feel like uh like I'm really at a
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because I don't have as
 
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
much background as the folks on division
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
three I really would defer to them for
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
the ultimate decision I have
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
several questions about leaving the
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the executive Council
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
to make the final decision I have a
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
question about the Appropriations I have
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
questions about you know who should be
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
issuing rfps whether it should be Das or
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
DHHS I'm assuming all those questions
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
will be ferreted out and assuming all of
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
that on that basis I'm comfortable with
 
01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:29.420 align:start position:0%
it moving forward that was a lot of
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
provisos but
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
I was like what was the very end I was
 
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
making notes here that was I said with
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
the understanding that several of these
 
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
issues are going to be ferreted out a
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more I I'm deferring to the
 
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
division I would be comfortable with it
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
moving forward thanks representative
 
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:57.470 align:start position:0%
moving forward thanks representative
hatched

01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.169 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
01:31:00.179 --> 01:31:02.149 align:start position:0%
microphone
I

01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
given the fact that I just arrived an
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
absent of any new information given
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
today I'm not sure I I can give a
 
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.149 align:start position:0%
today I'm not sure I I can give a
educated

01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
educated
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
vote so to speak I do trust my
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the convict on the
 
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
committee that are here and if it seems
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
like the consensus is to have it move
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
forward and this does need to be done
 
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
um so I can't abstain so I guess um
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
you know I certainly would support
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
moving forward Mr chairman so I think
 
01:31:38.219 --> 01:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
moving forward Mr chairman so I think
it's

01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
pretty close to a unanimous vote from
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
our recommendation from our division so
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
so the summarize that's that looks like
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
seven to nothing with the recommendation
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
to move it to the full finance committee
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
there are amendments that we need to
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
consider in the full finance committee
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
there are questions to be uh outstanding
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
the representative evil if if you could
 
01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
if you could help Mr Ripple just make
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
sure he understands specifically what
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
questions you'd like to have addressed
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the full finance committee he's he's
 
01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
really good at knocking those out so
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.070 align:start position:0%
okay and then
um

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
Mr clerk would you take a straw poll on
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
just ask everyone what they think and
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're willing to move
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
this HP 49 as amended by zero six two
 
01:32:49.729 --> 01:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think I go last
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
so look I got everybody
 
01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.550 align:start position:0%
so look I got everybody
um

01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you just briefly I want to say yes
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
I am in favor of moving this forward to
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
make that clear uh secondly I just want
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
to thank Mr ripson and Mr cupper for all
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
of your information and your patience
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
through this process those of us on
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
division three have heard from you now
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
multiple times and you've always
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
answered sometimes the same question and
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
we truly appreciate all the time you've
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this thirdly I just want to
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
make a mention that there's a great
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
cross-section in the audience I notice
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
and based on a straw poll you've all
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
nodded your heads as yes I think that's
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
very telling so let's move forward thank
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
I would move it forward but I would like
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
to hear the answers to a few of the
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
questions that we still do not have
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
we've still not had a chance to meet
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
with arpa and I think that it's not arpa
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
I guess it's gopher
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's kind of an
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
important piece of this
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to find us a year or two
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
down the road and all of a sudden find
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
us in a situation where the feds have
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
something that they would like to tell
 
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
us so
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to the committee I missed
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
almost an hour of discussion on this
 
01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
amendment and so I know it won't make a
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
difference but I'm just going to say no
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
on the principle of that that I have not
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
heard enough of the discussion of
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
specifics on the amendment
 
01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.350 align:start position:0%
specifics on the amendment
General

01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:40.679 --> 01:34:41.450 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
I know there's an open request to go
 
01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
visit the current sun in New Center I
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
think there's real value to the members
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
especially me being a Freshman on this
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
committee and dealing with this issue
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
for the first time so I I would my
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
preference would be to retain it until
 
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
we've had that discussion and that visit
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
so for now we're recording you as a no
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
you're not ready you're not ready to
 
01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
move it to the full financing correct
 
01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.410 align:start position:0%
move it to the full financing correct
representative

01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.090 align:start position:0%
representative
no

01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.169 align:start position:0%
no
okay

01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
um representative nordgren is not here
 
01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.250 align:start position:0%
um representative nordgren is not here
um

01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh I would say no Stringham
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh votes no and I think that just leaves
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I have three yeses
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
and four nose and Two Notch here so on
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
the basis of today's vote I'm going to
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
move this uh hb4 as amended to the full
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions or
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh last call Representative Weiler or
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
other one walner we do look alike I know
 
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.330 align:start position:0%
other one walner we do look alike I know
um

01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.470 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
how was it you just decided you were
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
going to move it forward when didn't
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
division how did division three uh
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
division yeah how did division three
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
come out
 
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
I I uh I took the seven
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
plus the three that's uh in this
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
combined joint committee that's a ten to
 
01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:27.770 align:start position:0%
combined joint committee that's a ten to
four

01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
and we have representative Weiler who
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure would have voted yes we had
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire who committed to
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
me before this meeting he voted I've got
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
to be here to vote so so but the the
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
straw count is uh is is ten to four and
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
I'm just really sick of this bill so let
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
let the let the full finance committee
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
deal with it I'm done we're done we've
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
done this it's dead we've done this
 
01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:54.830 align:start position:0%
done this it's dead we've done this
yeah

01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
so when it goes to the full finance
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee usually it gets exact pretty
 
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
good and there's not an in-depth or time
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
for in-depth discussions around the bill
 
01:37:04.139 --> 01:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
for in-depth discussions around the bill
so

01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
um moving this forward to the full
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee is it the intention to have it
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
exact time in the near future or what
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
what is the intention I will not speak
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
for the chairman of Finance I I I'm
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
moving it back to his domain with a
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation of uh Joint Committee of
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh of ten to four
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
to move it to his committee we we've
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
also picked up a number of questions and
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
potential amendments that the full
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
finance committee ought to look at so if
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
I were him I would still think that
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
we've got a few things to discuss and
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
consider it's not quite ready for exec
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
in my view but I don't want to speak for
 
01:37:50.219 --> 01:37:53.090 align:start position:0%
in my view but I don't want to speak for
him

01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for my own
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
process since I'm new is this comment
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
that we would have multiple divisions
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
come and take a vote on something before
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
moving it
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question and I've been
 
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
told that these work sessions are very
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
flexible and
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and and and uh and I just applied the
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
flexibility with the permission of the
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and with the chairman of
 
01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
division one and uh you know we just
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
took a straw vote
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
10 people would like to get the full
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
finance committee involved and get it
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
out of division three that's all this
 
01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you I want to
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
change your vote by any chance
 
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.110 align:start position:0%
change your vote by any chance
um

01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I want to concur with your last
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
statement this may be somewhat weird but
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
in my understanding is via the clerk
 
01:38:54.890 --> 01:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
right the various divisions are truly
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittees as opposed to distinct
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
committees like we would think about
 
01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
children family law versus I don't know
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
um criminal justice
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
so because of that right the bill always
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
kind of resides with the full committee
 
01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:11.219 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee did some work to
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what the what the potholes
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
are and we've discovered some and we
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
need to work on those and but really the
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee really can't do anything
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
other than make a recommendation like a
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would on any other
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee and ultimately the
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the bill is the full
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
committee um I think representative or
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards sought out other people
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
um to kind of work on this but I I think
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's still some work to do on
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think that's going to be
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
a long day in in finance
 
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
that's what we roll our sleeves up it
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
took it was a long day on sb1 it will be
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
a long day on this one I'm sure as well
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
so I would just point out when we had a
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
very long day on division three and came
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
out to a very specific uh agreement on
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
what we would move forward it was 15
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
minutes before bringing it up that I was
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
told that people's minds had changed and
 
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh I you know I I not being able to
 
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
trust the people who like don't really
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
trust the process I'm ready to move this
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
to the full finance committee
