so you should have that
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
and um we can have a little side by side
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
discussion on that a little later here
 
00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
discussion on that a little later here
representative

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
so going on to the first bill
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i also have been doing
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
research on that question that i raised
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
on the agricultural bill where they want
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
to do a governmental nonprofit
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i had a meeting yesterday with a
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer who does this kind of thing he
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
says no no he looked at the bill and he
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
said no no you can't do this
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
but he's got a solution of how you can
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
do it and that is something similar to
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
what they do with the public defender's
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
office in the state and i've got
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
material coming on that that i will
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
share with the committee as well but i
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let you know that i have
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
done some research with lawyers who know
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
more than i do who have agreed that the
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
way the bill is presented you can't do
 
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
way the bill is presented you can't do
it

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
if nothing else he said it would open it
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
would wave the the um
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
immunity for the state so anything done
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
by that corporation the state could be
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
sued and would be fully liable
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
something i'm sure we have no intention
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
of doing so at any rate i just wanted to
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
let you know that i'm working on that
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that's coming as well
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
we don't have that schedule that that's
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
not in the docket
 
00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.430 align:start position:0%
not in the docket
that's

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
which means i won't be here for it so if
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's not this week um because i leave
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
you know on the six so um but i i wanted
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
to bring it because i realized i won't
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
be here for it but i wanted to try and
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
get it before you guys
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
and let you know that i've done the work
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
on it and that the bill is going to need
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment to really be something
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's viable
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
legally viable along the way i keep
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
saying everybody i love the idea of the
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural education it's just the
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
structure that's the problem okay so we
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
will look at that
 
00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:32.629 align:start position:0%
will look at that
um

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
coming from an attorney speaking and
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
another attorney and every attorney i've
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
but i respect what you're saying
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative waltz and we will take
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
that and look at it when when we get
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
time to do that before
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate that comment are there
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
any is there any other information for
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
the committee today before we start
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay let's start with the first bill
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative to requirements
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
for teacher certification and i look to
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
oh jeepers i'm going to hand the gavel
 
00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.829 align:start position:0%

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
chairman for a uh motion okay i'd like
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'll second that thank you
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh discussion
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.549 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
there are a number of reasons why i feel
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
that uh this bill is very you know it's
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
i don't it's just not doable
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to look at all the rules
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
and regulations that we have if you look
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
at 306
 
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.029 align:start position:0%
at 306
the

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
rules rules which we have and we have
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
rules the feds have regulations
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh the rules which we have are about 104
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
pages long as i recall in ed 306 which
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
is the minimum standards for
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
public school approval we have rules for
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
special ed we have rules for cte we have
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
rules for everything
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
and those rules may be applicable for a
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent to understand or even a a
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
building principle to read and
 
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.669 align:start position:0%
building principle to read and
understand

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
however it's not necessary that you have
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
a first grade teacher understanding all
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
that i'm also concerned that
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
will

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
really slow down the process of seeking
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
emergency certification where you can't
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
find a particular teacher to fill a slot
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
where school districts and the
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
department of education presently have
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
an emergency process in which a person
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
can be given a one-year temporary
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
certification to get them on board and
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes do that in cases of of
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
like physical therapy occupational
 
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.510 align:start position:0%
like physical therapy occupational
therapies

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
et cetera you might have a speech
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
pathologist that doesn't have cs but
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
they have a four-year degree and they
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
can be working towards that and we can
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
work something out so the students can
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
receive service
 
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
receive service
there's

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
also just the issue of reciprocity
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
between one state and another state you
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity agreements here
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
throughout new england
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
and however this would just add in
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
another requirement that before you're
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
going to get certification in this state
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
you've got to jump through all these
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
hoops and and take a course our class
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
and and all these rules
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
and lastly there there's a cost to all
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
this uh who's going to be teaching this
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
particular class
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
and is it going to be doe is it going to
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
somebody else that's not identified so
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
with all that i would recommend that we
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
does the
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
seconder have any comments
 
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.029 align:start position:0%
seconder have any comments
uh

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%

deal with the executing hb 10
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
90 relative to teaching on
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the public schools i
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
look to represent lakas for a motion
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay and we have a set we have a motion
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
made by representing lycus and second by
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
representing nelson
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
discussion representative leicas
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing a lot
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
having to do with rsa 19340
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
and as well as
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
the other section 130 what three
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
at any rate the other section
 
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
at any rate the other section
um

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
so i want to get some things clear since
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
talking about this for quite a few bills
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to understand
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
what the objections are so i'm going to
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
go through this
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
sort of line by line and when you guys
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
say that you have an objection please
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
let me know so that i know oh we object
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
no pupil in any public school in this
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
state shall be taught that one sexual
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
orientation is inherently superior to
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
people of another sexual orientation
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
anybody have a problem with that
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
is it clear
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
so mr chair yeah um i just want to um
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
make it clear that that
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
we we're not responsible for uh having
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
to indicate
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
to representative likus's questions
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
whether we have a problem with it if she
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a problem with those
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
statements that's up to her to state but
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to be responsive
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
line by line and if we do not respond i
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't think that's an indication that we
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with what she's
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
reading certainly people are free to
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
respond but but no response doesn't mean
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we're okay i would just want to
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
make that abundantly clear i think
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
you've made your point very clear
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
and that nobody has to respond on this
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee to another person if you
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
desire not to
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
go and on the other hand
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
that leaves me free to assume that you
 
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.310 align:start position:0%
that leaves me free to assume that you
agree

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
no pupil
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
leaves me free
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
it may not leave the rest of the
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee free well we're telling you we
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't consent that okay that's fine you
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't consent
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
no pupil in any public school in this
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
state shall be taught that an individual
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
by virtue of their sexual orientation is
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
inherently racist sexist or oppressive
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
whether consciously or unconsciously
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
no people in any public school mr
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
chairman yes representative could i ask
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
what representative flakis is reading
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
because i have the law as currently
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
written in front of me
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what you what you're
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
reading from representing that's fair
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
instead of say i went and instead of
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
saying taught instructed inculcated or
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
compelled to express belief in or
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
support for any one or more of the
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
following i just picked the first word
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
taught okay to make it easier because
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's what you do when you have a long
 
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.750 align:start position:0%
that's what you do when you have a long
list

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
because then we'll go back and look at
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
those other words and see if it's
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
instructed inculcated or compelled
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
etcetera that is objectionable i'm
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
trying to make it clear
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
what you need to do is that
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
a bill which we're addressing and you've
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
indicated that you've made a motion to
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
itl the bill
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
with that uh you would give a rationale
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
of why you're making that particular
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
motion well i mean you can you can give
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
your research to and then you can
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
counter that yourself
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay well may i follow up yes
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the law and the first
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
indicator is one's age
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
so yeah so
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
what what i
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
if in fact we're not going to get that
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
this back and forth represent like us
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
you have the floor to
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
support your your motion uh if there are
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be answered uh
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
they can be done after you
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
after it goes to another person to have
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be recognized by the chair we can't
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
go back and forth like this thank you i
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yes
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't wish to be
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
to go through
the

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
statute piece by piece by piece i don't
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
i feel patronized in some way
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm part of a class now
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that um is learning about this law
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not what we're doing
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
here today we are voting up or down on
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.230 align:start position:0%
here today we are voting up or down on
these

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
these uh bills and the bill
 
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.549 align:start position:0%
these uh bills and the bill
uh

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative lakers has has said her
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
um you know support for this bill or her
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
support for the itl i'm sorry
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know you've made it clear but i i
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
really object
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
to going through
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
represent like us would you go ahead
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
please proceed thank you thank you i
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
we keep saying we're going to repeal
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
this i want to make it clear what we're
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
repealing that's why we're going through
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
it because this is what i object to i
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we're repealing
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
this and that's why i'm going through
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
the bill says no pupil in any public
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
school in the state shall be taught that
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
an individual should be discriminated
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
against or receive adverse treatment
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
solely or partly because of their sexual
 
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.470 align:start position:0%
solely or partly because of their sexual
orientation

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
no pupil or in in any public school in
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
the state shall be taught that people of
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
one sexual orientation cannot treat
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
others without regard to sexual
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
orientation yes
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
i object i i don't know how more to
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
object to this than to get up and leave
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
i find this totally patronizing
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
read the bill if
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
i would not try to read a bill
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
reading the law actually reading the law
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
to say you know what's objectionable in
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
here obviously you don't find anything
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
objectionable in it
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
others do
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why we vote on a bill rather
 
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.230 align:start position:0%
and that's why we vote on a bill rather
than

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
go through law piece by piece by piece i
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
i just i don't know how to object any
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
stronger we we have read read the law
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
represent like us what you need to do
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
right now is to explain why you are
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
offering this particular position
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
of itl
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay number one all of those in section
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
one i i
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
think we should all be supporting
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find out because we're
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding with an exec session is
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
that we are supposed to be discussing
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
not just oh we're voting this way
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
because of this we're voting this way
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
because of this end of statement vote go
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
i thought we were supposed to discuss
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is a bill this is a piece of law
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
that bill after bill is trying to repeal
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
and so the question is why are we
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
repealing this and so
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
why i am trying to understand what the
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
objection to this piece of law is
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
that was why i was going through
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
each section and say okay so i can if
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
since you have read it and you have it
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
and you know what it is
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
what are the objections to section two
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
then i'm not reading it and that can be
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
answered if it's so if people so desire
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
when you give the floor up another
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i would be willing to
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
respond on a more general basis to
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative leakers i'm certainly not
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
going to go section by section
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
but what she's looking for is why people
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
object and i would address that if she's
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
so interested
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're going through the parliamentary
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
process right now where the maker of the
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
motion has an opportunity to explain why
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
the motion was put forth the second has
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
the same opportunity to do that
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
then when we get into the debating on
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
that then that's what follows
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the process we saw if there
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
are questions let's get this motion you
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
know put forth we have it put forth but
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
have the maker and then the second
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
explain why they're you know of that
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
opinion or that position
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into the questioning
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
back and forth through our discussion
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
i will do that um
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
i keep reading this i i do not
 
00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:05.110 align:start position:0%
i keep reading this i i do not
understand

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
what the problem is
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
i am itling it because i don't want to
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of this piece of law i think it
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
is a good piece of law and i am quite
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
happy to listen to people who will point
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
out specifically
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
what it is that they object to and why
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's all based on those first four lines
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
that i read yes i did not read every
 
00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:33.509 align:start position:0%
that i read yes i did not read every
single

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
age sex gender identity sexual
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
orientation race creed color marital
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
status etc
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
because why by the time you put all
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
those words in you can't understand what
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
it says so the way you read something
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
like that is you pick one of the words
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
and use that one
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
and and when you have something that
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the same thing and then there's a
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
list you put the same thing in front of
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
it so i wanted to make it very clear
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about because we're
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about it all day and
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make it very clear what it
 
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make it very clear what it
was

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
because i hear all kinds of arguments
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
about what these things say and i wanted
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
to make it clear what it says because i
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
keep hearing that it says things that it
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
and so i just wanted everybody to hear
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does say
 
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:26.549 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does say
but

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
i won't patronize you and read it that
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
way thank you thank you very much
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative nelson do you ha as maker
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
of the second do you have any discussion
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay it's open to the full committee now
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
for discussion representative waltz
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to direct this to
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
representative lakers so i'm sure the
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
whole committee is appropriate for the
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
whole committee what you don't
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
understand and what is puzzling to you
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
is why
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
you don't see where any one of these
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
individual issues it's not the
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
individual issue it's the summation of
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
them it's a chilling this bill has been
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
proposed in states around the country
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
and if you read the news like i do
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
nationally not just in new hampshire but
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
nationally these bills are chilling the
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
teaching of history in this country
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
teachers are afraid to go anywhere near
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
these topics because they're afraid
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be accused of violating
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
so there are huge gaps now in what our
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
children are being taught because
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
teachers are scared to address
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
touchy subject matters and these are
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
difficult subject narrators but they're
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
important the history of racial
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination in our country is a
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
crucial part of our history we've fought
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
a war over it but teachers are afraid to
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
go there teaching about it in any way
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
shape or form they're afraid to teach
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
about the civil rights movement a huge
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
part of our history
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is a law that chills the ability of
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
teachers to teach it's a law that
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
deprives our children thereby depriving
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
our children of an appropriate
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of history that is why
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
people object to it so you're right if
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
you pick it apart one at a time word by
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
word it's hard to find a specific thing
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
that somebody objects to but when you
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
look at it in its entirety as one must
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
with any law
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
it is a law that chills teaching the
 
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.829 align:start position:0%
it is a law that chills teaching the
truth

00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
truth
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's problematic
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.589 align:start position:0%
representative
see

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you it's it's hard to get
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
recognized over here in the corner
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
um well especially when represent luna
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
has his head right in front that's right
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
right that's right i gotta go like this
 
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.630 align:start position:0%
right that's right i gotta go like this
right

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that this bill is the
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
start of censorship in schools and we
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
know that because we see it as
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative walt says across the
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
united states but it's happening in in
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as well
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
censorship has started it first it's
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
starting with civil rights
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
and history of the civil war
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
and history of the united states but
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's extended far beyond that in fact in
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
the first section you read
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have florida who is taking gay out of
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
the school uh any talk of of any
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
um sexual orientation
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh we heard in even testimony in
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
here uh people see it as transgenderism
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
getting transgenderism out of the school
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard of books being burned
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
and attacking schools i went to a school
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
board meeting the other day
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
and at that school board meeting
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
the chair the uh assistant
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent talked about how
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh some vigilante because that's the
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
other part of this bill is it sparks
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
vigilantism and has a 500 reward for for
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
finding out about teachers and evidently
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
somebody in his district
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
wanted that 500
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
because they had called and said that
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
they had seen on this teacher's facebook
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i just want to remind everybody
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
that they're trolling facebook
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
that she had joined a
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
a group of um teachers that were talking
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh about
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
this particular law and about the the
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
ramifications and the and the guide
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
rails for it
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
and because of that this person this
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
citizen this parent
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
wanted this teacher investigated
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
and and spelled out how she wanted this
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
teacher investigated wanted the
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent to go into the classroom
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to confiscate all the curriculum
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
that this teacher was teaching
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to have
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
the teacher brought up before the school
 
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
the teacher brought up before the school
board

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
and the assistant superintendent said
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know this is one of our best
 
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.670 align:start position:0%
you know this is one of our best
teachers

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.430 align:start position:0%
teachers
and

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
he said what a waste of my time
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
she's an excellent teacher
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
she teaches the truth
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
she didn't do anything objectionable
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
this person had never been in her class
 
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.550 align:start position:0%
this person had never been in her class
that

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
the student her child had long ago
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
graduated from the school it was simply
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
something that she heard on the radio
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
the television
 
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.069 align:start position:0%
the television
through

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
certain um
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
apps or uh
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
facebook herself facebook pages yourself
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
this is what this bill does
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
or this law does and this bill seeks to
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
reverse that
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
what is being taught at schools and how
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's being taught
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
is really a local issue it's
 
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
is really a local issue it's
superintendents

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
and um i think our schools uh
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
address issues when they come up um just
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
like this one was a just but as this
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent said
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
with everything going on covet
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
everything that they've gone through
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
what a waste of time
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
our law isn't the same as florida or the
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
rest of them there are only four
 
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.270 align:start position:0%
rest of them there are only four
sections

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
i mean four lines they're very clear
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
what they are that's why i had wanted to
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
read the four things they're very clear
 
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.829 align:start position:0%
read the four things they're very clear
and

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
get rid of laws because people spread
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
misinformation about them what a way to
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
get rid of any law we want to get rid of
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
just get out and spread misinformation
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then people will say
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
i can't do anything with that because of
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know misinformation that's out there
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's the spreading of misinformation
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
that has teachers terrified that has
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
that has teachers saying i can't teach
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
anything that has the chilling effect
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the appropriate response is not to
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
say well let's take care of the get
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
let's get rid of this law because
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's all this misinformation the
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
correct response is to say let's get the
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
proper information out there because i
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
think if you read those first things the
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
things that they say they're not
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to be teaching
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
nobody in here will object i didn't
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
expect anybody to object to any of them
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
because they're not objectionable
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
they're things that we've all been
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
arguing and fighting for for years
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
all these things this
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination we don't want these
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
kids discriminated against
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that's what it's about keeping the
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
kids from being discriminated against
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
and it's very clear but some people
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
apparently do want to discriminate and
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
therefore they're spreading
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
misinformation and everybody's reacting
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
to the misinformation so rather than
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the law
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
we it's a good law
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's just saying don't do
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
these things that we've been saying
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't do
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
we should get that information out there
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
we should get the truth out there and
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
say no this law doesn't say you can't
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
teach about racism or any of that other
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
stuff it says you can't say one race is
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
better than another race
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
it says you can't teach that somebody
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
should be discriminated against based on
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
their race
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's nothing just that we don't none
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
of you want teachers doing that right
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's what you've been saying for years
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want teachers doing that
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's all this is sure i've got it i've
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
got to object to words being put in our
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
mouths oh okay expectations being being
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
said of what we should be voting for and
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
what we should be supporting i think
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is just outrageous
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
and um and and and and a very extreme uh
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
an extreme position and and just not a
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
not fruitful debate representative
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
not fruitful debate representative
mullen

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i i'm gonna
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
present perhaps a little different point
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
of view
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think teachers are chilled by the
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition of the free exchange of
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
ideas in their classroom
 
00:41:57.359 --> 00:41:58.390 align:start position:0%
ideas in their classroom
not

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
because somehow or another they don't
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
want to protect the protected classes
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that the prohibition against
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
free exchange of ideas is in fact
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
chilling i also think that
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
we're forgetting that this law also
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
provides for
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
civil action against teachers schools
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
we're also forgetting that it's a very
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
vague law
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
and that a violation by a teacher of a
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
law that is very vague could result in
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
being found guilty of of uh
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
crimes against the teacher code of
 
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.990 align:start position:0%
crimes against the teacher code of
conduct

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i think this goes way beyond whether
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
or not we are uh in fact protecting the
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
protected classes
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
because once we move beyond that
 
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
because once we move beyond that
language

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
i think the intent becomes clear
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
that this is set up to be a legalistic
 
00:42:58.079 --> 00:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
that this is set up to be a legalistic
issue

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%

further discussion representative uh
waltz

00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
waltz
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
what has happened with this is
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
and all you only have to read our emails
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
to see it people writing to us all the
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
time say i don't want critical race
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
theory taught in the schools the words
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
critical race theory are not in this law
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
but they have interpreted this law to be
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
critical race theory the fact of the
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
matter is most of them have no idea what
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is and they have
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
twisted it into something it's not and
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're going after teachers saying
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're teaching critical race theory
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
when one they're not to the
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
the person making the allegation doesn't
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
understand what critical race theory is
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is mccarthyism all over again this
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
is no different than what mccarthy did
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the 50s where you put stuff out there
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
you scare people they're afraid to talk
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
and then they are chilled so that they
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
won't go there this is wrong and if we
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
understand history we know that we
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
should not be doing this again
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
first i would point everybody to 193 40
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
roman 2 which says nothing in this
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
section shall be construed to prohibit
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussing as part of a larger course of
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
academic instruction the historical
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
existence of ideas and subjects
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
identified in this section
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think that that's
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
pretty clear
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
i i see nowhere is there any prohibition
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the free exchange of id ideas
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
and in terms of mccarthyism
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at the department of justice
 
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
if you look at the department of justice
website

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
there is a link
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
to a complaint form to submit uh
 
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
to a complaint form to submit uh
complaints

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
about parents
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
so uh you know
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
i i think that's chilling
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
and it started with the department of
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
education the us department of education
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
to the national school boards
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
association to the department of justice
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
um it was a whole pre-arranged um
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
motion that
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
got the doj and fbi involved
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
um to tracking parents so if you want to
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
talk about chilling
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
to me that is chilling
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i see nothing in here
 
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.069 align:start position:0%
and i see nothing in here
that

00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.109 align:start position:0%
that
should

00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
present a chilling effect on the
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
teaching of of slavery or
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
the civil war or anything else um it's
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
extend

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
extend
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
what's in 354 our human rights
 
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.349 align:start position:0%
what's in 354 our human rights
commission

00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
to prevent any
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
inculcation or compelling of students to
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
express one belief
 
00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
express one belief
in

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
in a classroom or outside a classroom
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
so i i am totally supportive of the uh
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%

tanner

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know we have a
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
law on the books that allows a parent to
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
come into the school
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
and object to any material and actually
 
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.430 align:start position:0%
and object to any material and actually
provide

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.630 align:start position:0%
provide
alternative

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
education for it as a former health
 
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.230 align:start position:0%
education for it as a former health
teacher

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
you can bet that over the 35 years that
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
i taught we had several people that came
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
in and had objections and each time that
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
parent came in with objections
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh we dealt with it uh the student was
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
given alternative uh course of of study
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
and we went on and everybody seemed very
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
satisfied with that um if that
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
law was working and i feel from personal
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
experience it was working very well for
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
who wanted certain
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
topics to be taught at home and not in
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
the school that's great
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
they were able to do that
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
then why on earth
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
did we need
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to have a bill like this
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
offered five hundred dollars
 
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.790 align:start position:0%
offered five hundred dollars
to

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
report a teacher
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that teacher as representative
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
mullin said one of the chilling effects
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
is just like this teacher at kearsarge
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
she could have lost her license
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
her credential
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's her livelihood
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
spent thousands of dollars on education
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
to get there
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
has worked very hard
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
and put in her time and loyalty and
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
teachers go above and beyond
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
and yet something like this
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
could be drummed up
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that teacher loses their license i
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
to say it doesn't have a chilling effect
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
um is failing to see reality i think
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative luna
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair yeah i i
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
mean i think too to
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
to fail to see that the existing law
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a chilling effect really
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
ignores i think a lot of the testimony
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that that we've heard in this committee
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that has come across in other committees
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
and that has um
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
been uh been published um in newspapers
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
media across the state
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
once in particular i can think of is is
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
um is from
 
00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:30.630 align:start position:0%
um is from
uh

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
the um the rudman center at unh law
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
where where specifically the law was
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
cited is having a a chilling effect on
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
teachers and and very much i think you
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
know corresponds to what we've heard in
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
this committee where quote the law's
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
broad use of the word teach dissuades
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
teachers from presenting material as a
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
jumping off point for discussion unless
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
they be accused of indoctrinating
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
students simply because they expose them
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
to uh to one author's thesis
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
other testimony
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
because quote because of the vague
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
language and stiff penalties some
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
educators will inevitably avoid
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
important topics concerning race and
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
gender because they fear being the
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
subject of a complaint or a lawsuit from
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
an angry parent or student who does not
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
like what is uh in their curriculum
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
and you know i'm not i you know like i
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
could i could go on and say you know
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
what the what why
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
these discussions are important but i
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
don't even think you have to i can i can
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think just just the chilling effect
 
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.270 align:start position:0%
i think just just the chilling effect
alone

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
is is just so abhorrent to what we
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
consider to be
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
public you know public education public
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
schools and uh
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the ability for for teachers
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to address uh complaints
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
either directly with parents directly
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
with students or or directly with their
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard this nearly
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
universally it's it's fun for all of us
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
to sort of like pretend like
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
like you know we're the we're the
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
end-all when it comes to understanding
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
these situations but i think taking the
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
information and relying on the
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
information that we hear from from
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
experts and in this case a really
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
diverse set of experts in the field that
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
call this law chilling
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and advocate for its repeal
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
finally i'd i'd say
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
another expert and this is actually from
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
a from a law firm and there's a number
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
of law firms that have weighed in on
 
00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.470 align:start position:0%
of law firms that have weighed in on
this

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
is is you know in law firms a lot of law
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
firms i think like it when um when you
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
know um when the right of
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
private action opens up and can provide
 
00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:53.829 align:start position:0%
private action opens up and can provide
um

00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
business for this for them you know
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's suing teachers or some
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
school districts all that translating
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
into higher property taxes but uh but
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
this law firm says despite its brevity
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
or perhaps because of it it creates a
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
legal minefield for new hampshire public
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
school teachers and school
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
administrators and i think that extends
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
right to uh right to property taxpayers
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
as well that are going to have to pay
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
the the funds to defend schools from uh
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
from these cases so i think what the

cordelie's comments on the
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
apparent issue the parent concern and
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
that does sound chilling but it's not
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
applicable to this particular bill
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
what i find chilling in this is as a
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
former high school social science
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
teacher i was reflecting upon that young
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
woman who was in here about
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
well today's on the 9th of february
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
talking about the limitations to put on
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
this her ap class
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
and her potential teaching
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
we know that when we allow good teachers
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.470 align:start position:0%
to teach
inquisitive

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%

thought-provoking dialogues
 
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.829 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking dialogues
students

00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
now become interested involved have a
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
chance to dialogue themselves and the
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
whole process of education takes off and
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
grows and grows those are the types of
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
youngsters and the types of dialogues we
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
want in schools so the children come out
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
as young leaders young adults and move
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
on to become questioning
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
leaders in our country and making
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
decisions for the betterment of the
 
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.390 align:start position:0%
decisions for the betterment of the
people

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
but when we restrict the information we
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
allow them to have or we
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
provide a law that makes it
 
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
provide a law that makes it
uncomfortable

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
for teachers to provide that type of
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
instruction or limits in their mind
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
because of possible litigation that type
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
of instruction we've done a real
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
disservice to the base public education
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
process all the way up from the time we
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
try to create critical thinking in our
 
00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:12.549 align:start position:0%
try to create critical thinking in our
kids

00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills we need to have
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
that dialogue we can't do it on a very
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
washed out pastel
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
fake form of history
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
so i suggest that this is a huge
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
impact on public education
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
as it is on discrimination and
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination issues
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative litchfield
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
i did
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
so i i wanted to start by saying that i
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
understand where you're all coming from
 
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.069 align:start position:0%
understand where you're all coming from
because

00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's my platform is i don't agree with
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
censorship so i absolutely agree 100
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
with where you're coming from and i can
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
understand why the teachers would feel
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
paralyzed when they're teaching simply
 
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
paralyzed when they're teaching simply
because

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
i feel it even from the moment i won my
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
state legislator election because even
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
right now as i speak and the same with
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
you right we all know
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
everything that we're saying on camera
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to use those snippets for
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
or against us
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
my concern is within the classrooms no
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
matter what we're talking about when it
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
comes to even deij or any of this sort
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be balanced so we're
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
talking about what the teachers are
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
sharing for books right my concern is
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
if they want to share one type of book
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
that people may be uncomfortable with we
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
need to have that balance
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
and what i'd like to do if this is
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
allowed is just toss a question to rep
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
lacus and i just want to get a better
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
understanding for there's a reason why
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
this law came to be in the first place
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
last year it didn't come out of the blue
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for it what is the
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
reason for it is is that okay to do or i
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
could toss it to anybody in the room yes
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
that there's no problem with that what's
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
the basis for the law sure
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
because we have seen
 
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
because we have seen
teachers

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
and administrators
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
teaching things that basically says that
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
one race is inherently better than
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
another race
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
these are some things that
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
i mean and that's specifically in here
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say you can't talk about race
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
you can't talk about all the bad things
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
that have happened all the racism it
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
says you can't teach that one race is
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
better than another and that's why the
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
words are very specific
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
not general but very specific there are
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
four specific items
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that's one of them and it's because
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i will say i know this is happening
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
a girl came home i happened to be
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
visiting her mom she was a friend of my
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
daughters and my daughter was out
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
and she came home in tears now she has a
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
biracial family right her mom is very
 
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
biracial family right her mom is very
blonde

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
blonde
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
her dad is very black
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
and she happens to be the lightest of
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
the siblings and she came home in tears
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
because she was taught that because she
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
was white she was inherently racist
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
and she's a teenage kid right an
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
adolescent and she knows that being
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
racist is being evil and bad i mean
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's how it gets translated right
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
so she came home in tears now her
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
siblings are darker than her they're not
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
racist but because she happened to be
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
born lighter than her siblings she was
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
racist in other words she was evil
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
and this is a teenage girl who's already
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
having to deal with all those
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
self-image things that teenage girls are
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
having to deal with that is being taught
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that is why
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
these specific things were put in here
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
and they are four very specific things
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
because these are the things that people
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
were coming up against and that's why
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%

was and is uh it's in the dictionary now
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
it involves alarmist
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
scare tactics emotionalizing issues and

00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
to represent litchfield's point hb 54
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
originally came about because of genuine
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
documented concerns about proselytation
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the classroom there are plenty of
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
examples representative letters just
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
gave one
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
so to your question there are legitimate
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
reasons why that hb 54 came about now
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
hb54 did not become lie as it came to
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature didn't come to this
 
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.549 align:start position:0%
the legislature didn't come to this
committee

00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
the what's in law now is
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
words that are very
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
very benign and as representative
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
cordelli said
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
the law specifically protects
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
educators who want to have critical
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
thinking happen and have back and forth
 
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.190 align:start position:0%
thinking happen and have back and forth
happen

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.750 align:start position:0%
happen
um

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think representative while somebody
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned the mail that we get the
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
emails in this we get a ton of them and
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
message after message after message is
 
00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.190 align:start position:0%
message after message after message is
reversed

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
reversed
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
banned concepts divisive concepts
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
that that is not in law
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
and you know as a teacher i want to
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct these emails and send it back to
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
people and say you're using words that
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
are not in law
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i and as a again as a history teacher
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
i would not be at all threatened by this
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
if i do my job and do it right um and
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
don't proselytize what there's nothing
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
to worry about in terms of these scare
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
tactics i would venture to wager i
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
do make best from time about a year from
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
now there's not a single bounty that
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
will be collected i'll bet i'd be
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
surprised if there were any prosecutions
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
what this existing statute does is it
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
addresses legitimate real concerns and
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
it became law through the civics process
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with the current
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
law and so therefore i support the itl
 
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
law and so therefore i support the itl
motion

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative tanner
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
and allison
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't think it came through the
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
regular civics process
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
and uh that's another part of the
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
problem stakeholders weren't involved uh
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of discussion it was
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
actually i think put in hb2 if i'm
 
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
actually i think put in hb2 if i'm
correct

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative ellison uh thank you mr
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
i asked the maker of this motion in a
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
prior session if she could give me
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
examples of that
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire schools that the law
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
was supposed to address she has yet to
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
respond other than the one example she
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
just gave me
 
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:50.930 align:start position:0%
and i would also
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:52.470 align:start position:0%

question

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
the statement that was just made that
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of examples in new
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire schools where
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
things have taken place that the
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
original law addresses
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're dealing with uh
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
some conjecture here
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
and some wishful thinking on the part of
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
the people who were involved in this
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't me don't
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
know whose side this will be on
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
sat in on a classroom as a teacher in
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
the eighth grade
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i had to keep my mouth checked
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
because i was the guest not a guest but
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
an observer and this particular young
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
lady new teacher was talking about world
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
war ii
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
and japan and apologize for us bombing
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
japan with the atomic bomb now she never
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
gave the other side of this
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
she never said how many hundred thousand
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
american troops would have been killed
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
she never mentioned any of that
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's all she said all i could think of
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
is the kids leaving that classroom and
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
going home to the grandparents whoever
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
were alive back then and what they must
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
have thought when they spewed this out
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i was very concerned and i went to
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
her at the end of the class because it
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
was inappropriate for me to interrupt
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i said where did you get this from
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
she said my college teacher
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
that was it so these kids have something
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
in their mind at least if they could
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
have been justified to say this side and
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
this side i would have been happy
 
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.789 align:start position:0%
this side i would have been happy
but

01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just a frustration
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i just i just wanted to
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
mr representative nelson i would agree
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
a shame that all the information was put
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
out there but my point is that i would
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
also agree with representative tanner
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
when president lynchial asked a question
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the the response to the question
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
is it never came through this committee
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
it wasn't part of the civics process it
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
came on the back of a budget bill where
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
dialogue was not allowed had dialogue
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
been allowed we may not be here
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
discussing this today
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
so that's not a real civic process
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's not democracy by any means um so
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we're here to look at
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative moffat famous real quick
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
the legislative process as we all know
 
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.950 align:start position:0%
the legislative process as we all know
uh

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
allowed for
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
a version of five five five four four to
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
go for it had a full hearing uh it was
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh determining which committee heard it
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
was not this committee perhaps it should
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
have been this committee but it was a
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
long extended emotional series of
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
a bunch of testimony on 544 which was
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
changed in response to the testimony and
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
yes it wasn't part of hb2 or sb the
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
budget so it is a legitimate part of law
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
law making is like sausage making but
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
the legislative process was legitimate
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
and um so that i just wanted to say that
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's probably why sausage is unhealthy
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't give name specific school names
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
because sometimes i have problems
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
recalling names and didn't want to
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
accidentally say the wrong name
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
laconia dover
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
and we had testimony from a lady who
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
came in and had evidence on lots of
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
other schools the superintendents are
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually teaching
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
actual crt
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
in-service teacher training days and
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
pushing it and i do have copies of
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
slides that are used and they start out
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
with things like
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
the way to talk to a white kid about
 
01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:50.230 align:start position:0%
the way to talk to a white kid about
privilege

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
privilege
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
i can email you those slides if you want
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
to see them i was going to copy them off
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
and present them when i do present when
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
we do hear that bill but if you want to
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
know about it beforehand yes there is
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
evidence and yes we have the slides
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative lancaster you just made
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
my point because you said
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
superintendents are teaching actual
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
critical race theory and i suspect you
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what actual critical race
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
theory is because if you talk to an
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
academic at a university
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
actual critical race theories just says
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
that some of our institutions
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
are inherently
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
racially biased and that's true we know
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's some of that about policing some
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
of our institutions over time have had
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
some inherent bias embedded in them and
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
the supreme court and others have and
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
congress and state legislators have
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
passed laws to try and counter that bias
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
critical race theory does not teach that
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
one race is better than another it talks
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
about institutions that's what true
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think you believe
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
that that that is what's being taught in
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
our schools that there are institutional
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
issues so what i'm suggesting is your
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
use of the terms critical race theory is
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
what's out there in the parlance and
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
it's the misunderstanding of what true
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is and about how
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
there have been institutional issues in
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
this country that needed to be addressed
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
in laws and in case law
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
you know i agree that we should not be
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
teaching one race is better than another
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
that is not critical race theory if you
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead and yes
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
i know that's why i didn't bring that up
 
01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:42.150 align:start position:0%
i know that's why i didn't bring that up
here

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
because this is not about critical race
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
theory i know that i was addressing the
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
fact that he went back to 1255 and said
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
that i didn't come up with any instances
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i was giving instances for 1255
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
and according to these slides and these
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
people they are claiming its critical
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
race theory
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
i've heard lots of different things what
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
critical race theory means
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is they are claiming it
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
no they're not teaching these things
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
this does not have to do with critical
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
race theory
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay i know that and that's why it
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't say critical race theory
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere in here
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
but i was responding he was talking
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
about i was talking about indoctrination
 
01:06:28.319 --> 01:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
about i was talking about indoctrination
and

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
teaching a specific theory or ideology
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
or idea
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
and so that was the examples i was
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
giving for that i was responding to his
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
question about specifics not about this
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill at all that was about a totally
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
different bill
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
and i was responding to the fact you
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
said specifically that superintendents
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
and others are teaching critical race
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
theory in our schools when you said that
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's what i felt the need to respond
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
to because i don't believe that's true
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
well they believe that's true because
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they called it and so all
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm saying is they're teaching what they
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
believe is critical race theory which is
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
um at any rate further discussion
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative simon
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um always a little
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
bit hesitant to jump into a conversation
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
when you're not a part of the actual
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee where people have been
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
discussing this at length but
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
um for whatever it's worth i have
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
personal experience with this particular
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
issue both of my children
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
attended a school
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
where these topics were discussed um
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
and in a sense it is a manifestation of
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
critical race theory even if it's not
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
critical race theory that's being taught
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i think this law in particular looks
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
to address um the idea that critical
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
race theory would be manifested in our
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
school system and what i mean by that is
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
is levied against children
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
to tell them things about themselves
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
that are untrue
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the child has to deal with the
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
institutional power coming down upon
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
themselves it's not one child saying
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
something to another child it's going
 
01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
something to another child it's going
into

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
an auditorium where something is being
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
presented by the official capacity of
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
the institution where they're made to
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
fill out surveys in which they're asked
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
what their race is what their
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status is what their
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
sexuality is and my daughter came home
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
in tears the first day saying the only
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
thing i've got for me is i'm a is i'm a
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
girl otherwise i'm the worst human being
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
on the world
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i watched as relationships that she
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
had with her friends who were majority
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
people of color
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
disintegrated over her time in that
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
school so the point that after
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
graduation one of her friends contacted
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
her a little bit later and said i'm
 
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.510 align:start position:0%
her a little bit later and said i'm
sorry

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
i had no idea how bad it had really
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
gotten until i got away for a little bit
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
it took
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
for my daughter to decompress from that
 
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.430 align:start position:0%
for my daughter to decompress from that
whole

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
whole
situation

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
it is the institutional power behind it
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
that matters
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
that is a manifestation of critical race
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
theory even if it's not what's
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
technically being taught
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
and uh i think that's what this law
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
seeks to address
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i do take issue i don't want a
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on teachers i don't
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
but when the teachers are using the
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
institutional power to go after children
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
that i object to and that does happen
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i've experienced it firsthand and
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
i've been in that battle two years
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
against teachers who are are are highly
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
educated teachers and and to be honest
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
with you not even i wouldn't even
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
consider them to be bad people they're
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
good people i'm i was friends with them
 
01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
good people i'm i was friends with them
they're

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
and they're educated people you know
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
harvard grads and things of this nature
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
but there's there are ideas
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
there are ideas that we need to handle
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
with care when the institutional power
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
is behind them because children don't
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
have the power to stand up to that
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
institutional power
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
and to me that would be the concern so
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
once again for what it's worth not an
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
official member of this committee
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
but that that has been my personal
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
experience when it comes to these
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
particular topics so thank you for the
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities thank you very much
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative simon representative
 
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
representative simon representative
julius

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
julius
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
yeah frankly i was thinking about this
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
law er the way it is written
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
and i feel that
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
if back in the 1920s
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
germany had had a law like this
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
like the uh
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
the other representative i am a guest
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that struck me
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
about this particular law uh all the way
 
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
about this particular law uh all the way
along

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
along
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
is the chilling effect that it does have
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
on teachers and the chilling effect that
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
it has on teaching kids things that they
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
really do need to know
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
taking history courses
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
where literally the the only black
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
person we learned about in detail was
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
booker washington
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you grew up in the 60s there were a
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
lot of people who thought martin luther
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
king was a criminal
 
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
king was a criminal
um

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
we weren't taught about things like
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
reconstruction we weren't taught about
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
things like jim crow laws
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
and these are things that we are not
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
individually responsible for
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
we were not personally involved in these
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
things but what we have the opportunity
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
to do through education
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
is to teach our kids
 
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
why these things happened
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
what were the circumstances that led
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
to some of these terrible things and
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
some of these terrible laws happening
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
and what are some of the things that we
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
can do in the future
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent those things from happening
 
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.390 align:start position:0%
to prevent those things from happening
again

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
and especially in a state
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the last time i i looked
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
at demographic census we're 90 white
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i think it's more incumbent on
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
states like ours
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
where we do have
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
majority of one particular racial
 
01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
majority of one particular racial
composition

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
composition
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
to understand what people in the other
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
racial compositions have actually gone
 
01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.550 align:start position:0%
racial compositions have actually gone
through

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
and some of the struggles that they've
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
seen in our society is they try to
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
become equal
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm in the criminal justice and public
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
safety committee and one of the things
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we talk about all the time
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
is systemic racism
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
we have programs at the police standards
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
and training academy
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
to try to deal that that try to make
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
officers aware of things like that these
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
are not things that are illusions
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
these are things that that actually
 
01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.510 align:start position:0%
these are things that that actually
exist

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
and they're things that we have an
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to overcome
 
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.550 align:start position:0%
opportunity to overcome
but

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
laws like this
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
just make things so much more difficult
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they stifle
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
conversations that really that really
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
need to be had and i think they're not
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
just conversations that
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
that students need to have with teachers
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
but they're conversations that parents
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
need to have with their kids
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
um i was fortunate because i grew up in
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
a household where my parents were
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
willing to have those conversations with
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
everything that was going on in the 60s
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
with martin luther king being shot with
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
malcolm malcolm x being shot with the
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrations on tv every single night
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
from places from places down south and i
 
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.750 align:start position:0%
from places from places down south and i
mean

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
try to understand what that was like i
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us sort of live through
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
it and sometimes i think we forget what
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
it was like to kind of go through those
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
times as a child where you're trying to
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand things
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
so we're in a position now where where
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
we have on some of these issues
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
we do have the perspective of time
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
and these are things that do need to be
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
in our curriculum and sometimes teachers
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
are going to raise them in ways that
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
make them uncomfortable
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it means we need to be
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
prosecuting teachers
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
we heard another bill
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
where teachers
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
we have a teacher a hiring crisis and
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
staffing crisis in this state anyway
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
making this any better it's not making
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a more attractive place to
 
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.149 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a more attractive place to
teach

01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
teach
 
01:14:40.159 --> 01:14:41.350 align:start position:0%
teach
and

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative muse
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
are there further
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
 
01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
committee

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative simon sorry debate of the
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
debate of the two people who aren't
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
actually on the committee and very well
 
01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.510 align:start position:0%
actually on the committee and very well
spoken

01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
to do so go for it both of you it was it
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
was all very well said and and i agree
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
with you on so many of your points and
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the heart at which you're
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
coming at this uh what i would what i
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
would express is in my experience with
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
some of this particular material
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
for example on martin luther king day
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
martin luther king had the famous
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
statement he wants to see a world in
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
which people are judged on the contact
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
content of their character not on the
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
color of their skin but on martin luther
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
king day instead of teaching that to the
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
children they broke them off into racial
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
affinity groups
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
and segregated them from each other so
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
they could have race specific
 
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
they could have race specific
conversations

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and i don't i don't see how that
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
achieves the goals the lofty goals to
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
which you would you would want to see us
 
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.830 align:start position:0%
which you would you would want to see us
achieve

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.709 align:start position:0%
achieve
um

01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
there there are things about that and
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe this is where the deeper
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
discussion needs to happen maybe there's
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
there is confusion as to what's actually
 
01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:54.149 align:start position:0%
there is confusion as to what's actually
happening

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
and what that actually produces out into
 
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.590 align:start position:0%
and what that actually produces out into
society

01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
my experience with this genuinely
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
was that it increased racism it
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
increased animosity it didn't it didn't
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
solve anything
 
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.310 align:start position:0%
solve anything
um

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
it only exacerbated it and made it worse
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
where there wasn't any before where
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
children got along very well and
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
supported one another and
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
served with one another and learned with
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
one another and discussed with one
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
another they stopped talking
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
because some were taught that they were
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
oppressed and some thought that they
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
were oppressors
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and it just broke everything apart
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
so so maybe some clarification needs to
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
happen in the language maybe some some
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
deeper study needs to to happen but but
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
to say that that that's not happening
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
i know that it is i and i've experienced
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
it so um once again for what it's worth
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
i agree with your sentiments but i think
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
there there are things that are
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
happening that would actually undermine
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh undermine that and i think that
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's what this law from my perspective
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
this law is seeking to address simply
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
that i can't walk up to you and say
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
because you're white
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
you're racist
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're bad you need to get out of the
 
01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
you're bad you need to get out of the
way

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.870 align:start position:0%
way
um

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
and and that that teaching is although
 
01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.310 align:start position:0%
and and that that teaching is although
not

01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't encompass critical race
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
theory it is a part of uh the general
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
critical race theory um spectrum of of
 
01:17:18.239 --> 01:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
critical race theory um spectrum of of
thought

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be the systemic nature of
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
it um so once again
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult being in the
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee and listening because i feel
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
like valid things are being said on both
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
but but not necessarily i don't feel
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
like the conversation has necessarily
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
hit at all of the essential truths so
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
cordelli

01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
just point out that a lot of this
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
discussion has been about um subject of
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
race but the law
 
01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:55.030 align:start position:0%
race but the law
goes

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
well beyond that in terms of other
 
01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.270 align:start position:0%
well beyond that in terms of other
classes

01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
there should be no
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
instruction inculcation that
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
one religion is better than the other
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
that is superior to the other um you
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
know would would we want anyone to walk
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.870 align:start position:0%
up to
uh

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
someone coming out of a synagogue and
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
said uh
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
jews or such and such or um
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
a parish and say catholics are such and
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
such uh no that's what that's what this
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to um address it's not
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
just race
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
um it's um religion um
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
family status
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of issues that um i think
 
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.590 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of issues that um i think
that

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know we need to be careful in
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
addressing and and not promoting the
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
idea that one is better than the other
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you know what i'm
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
having a hard time wrapping my head
 
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.990 align:start position:0%
having a hard time wrapping my head
around

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that the legislative body
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
passed a law last year
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
that protected religious and private
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
schools from anyone being able to
 
01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.390 align:start position:0%
schools from anyone being able to
question

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
their ideology their mission their uh
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
credos or
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know putting it into a
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
perspective where
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
i can justify that we're going to
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
censor public school teachers but if you
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
teach in a private or a religious school
 
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.470 align:start position:0%
teach in a private or a religious school
then

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
this law doesn't apply to you
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
don't know i mean i i offer it as a
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
commentary more than more than a
 
01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
commentary more than more than a
question

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
because it just seems ironic to me that
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature passed a law to protect
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
private and religious schools and this
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
seems antithetical to that in public
 
01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.709 align:start position:0%
seems antithetical to that in public
schools

01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative mullen i i'd like to try
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
to respond a little bit to that
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
we have religious exemptions
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
in numerous areas of legislation
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
i.e medications
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
and in that
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with you i believe the way that
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
is written it is discriminatory
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
against the person who has no religion
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
but has a right of conscience
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
a right of belief
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
and your religion is your belief
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
my religion might be that it's not
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
religious belief it's my conscience and
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
my principles that i guide myself by and
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's my right of conscience and that's
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
in inherent to me
 
01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:53.189 align:start position:0%
in inherent to me
so

01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know i believe that we try to wrap a
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
lot of this up in some form of
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
legislation i don't think we always do a
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
great job of that
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
so that's my response that that there's
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we've had for almost
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
over an hour now
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
really indicates that this bill should
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
go to interim study
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
it would be good to uh have a robust
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
discussion about the bill
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
to have some public airing um
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
public testimony so i would i would say
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
that i plan to vote against
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
the itl and
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
i would say that an interim study might
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
be offered thank you
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes ref san luno sure thanks very much
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.669 align:start position:0%
mr chair
and

01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know just just real
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
real real simply uh you know i i don't i
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't see that there's any moral high
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
ground in support of the uh the existing
 
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.709 align:start position:0%
ground in support of the uh the existing
law

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
either in the words that uh that are in
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
statute now or how that uh that statute
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
was uh was arrived at i think the
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
existing law is quite simply about
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
censorship in schools with super high
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
stake penalties for um
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
for teachers and
 
01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:20.950 align:start position:0%
for teachers and
and

01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
exposes school districts to um
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
frivolous um lost lawsuits and having to
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
defend those so so
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
honestly i think the repeal language
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense i'm certainly going
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
to oppose the itl and i would support an
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
interim study but i'd also support an
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%

yes i don't know that i have to say a
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
whole lot more than the last one because
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
this does
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the same things it just repeals
 
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:17.780 align:start position:0%
those two areas
 
01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.070 align:start position:0%

[Music]

i will say
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
that i did write up for the history
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
teacher who came to see us
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about this build
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
history teacher that everybody liked and
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to have
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
his history teacher
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
i wrote up um
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
i just wrote down on here what the bill
 
01:25:40.239 --> 01:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
i just wrote down on here what the bill
says

01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
but instead of listing all the things
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
each time i just picked one out and
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
listed it and he said this is a really
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
good bill i like this i said is it
 
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
good bill i like this i said is it
unclear

01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
he said well the fourth one
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
because of the way it's worded because
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
it has a double negative was a little
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
harder to understand but he really liked
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
it and i said this is the bill they're
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
trying to repeal
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
and he did not like that idea so i just
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to pass that on
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah same reasons reps and nelson do
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
you have anything at this state
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you it's open for discussion
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um so yeah
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
there may be some people that like the
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
current law i mean given the fact that
 
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.229 align:start position:0%
current law i mean given the fact that
um

01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
that when house bill what was it 544 um
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh had substantial hearings in i think
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
it was in edna
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think it was i think it was an edna
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
and um and ended up
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
being retained
 
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.070 align:start position:0%
being retained
and

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
because it was so so um uh contentious
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot of people who
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
disagreed with with that bill but
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
clearly there were people that agreed
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
with it and uh and thought the best way
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
to get into law would be through the
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
budget process and jam it right into uh
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the budget
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
but um but this bill here house bill
 
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
but um but this bill here house bill
1576

01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
1576
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah there's probably some people that
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh that disagree with it but at least
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
based on the uh the numbers there were
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
1149 uh in support 357 opposed and in
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
the prior bill there was 1201 in support
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
and 70 people opposed so i hope a lot of
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
these people are watching i hope they're
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
talking to their friends i hope they're
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the next election and
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
i hope they're willing to hold people
 
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.390 align:start position:0%
i hope they're willing to hold people
accountable

01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
in this room and uh and and uh in the in
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the legislature to with the votes
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
they make and um and this is clearly a
 
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.870 align:start position:0%
they make and um and this is clearly a
law

01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
that is not um not supported by the vast
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
majority of granite staters and i think
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've got a great opportunity right here
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
and right now to repeal it thank you
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.950 align:start position:0%
further discussion
representatives

01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
i did want to remind you that that
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
individual came in
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition in support of repealing
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
he came in on one side based on what he
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
had heard and came out on the other side
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
having actually seen the law
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i would
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
ask all of you to go back to your notes
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you took in a wonderful manner
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
from this bill
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
and i always
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
ask you to remind yourself to
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
read through your notes from the
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
testimony we had by the rabbi from
 
01:28:38.639 --> 01:28:40.629 align:start position:0%
testimony we had by the rabbi from
nashua

01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
and how clear he was how powerful he was
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.390 align:start position:0%
on the
necessity

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
for improving what we do
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
as required discrimination in a public
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
workplace in schools and support
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
this law uh repeal uh if you did take
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
the time to read his testimony or you
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
have a print out in your worksheets in
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
front of you i'd ask you to review it
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
again because it is powerful and it is
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
clearly the way that we should be going
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
this law needs to be repealed thank you
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just interject a little bit
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
of what i went through as a teacher in
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the fourth grade and later as a school
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
principal and an administrator
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
when i was a teacher over in in maine
 
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
when i was a teacher over in in maine
but

01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
secondly when i went to alaska
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
we lived in a community
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
the only way to access that community
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
was by plane or by barge
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
and it was a native alaskan community
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
and my family and i my wife and kids
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
were distinctly a minority
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i watched my young girls which were
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
in first grade second grade as they were
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
taught in that classroom
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
there was no critical race theory
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
they went in there respecting everybody
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
else for what they were kids and kids
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
played together and learned together
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and ate together
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
as kids
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
but when we inject
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
this theory that we've been talking
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
about if that were injected
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
into there we'd be definitely splitting
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
those kids up into various groups
 
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.149 align:start position:0%
those kids up into various groups
and

01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't do that
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
and of course i've mentioned before
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
the younger daughter came out able to
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
speak yupik
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
and that was her foreign language when
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
so i i feel that there's ways of of
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
doing what we are trying to achieve in
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
this country and we've gone a long way
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
years that this country has been in
 
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.709 align:start position:0%
years that this country has been in
existence

01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
and we've had our downs and our ops
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
but we're moving forward
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to have a theory
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
telling us how to do that i think that
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
are we'll do it
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think we all will do it and we are
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
doing it so uh it the for the
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
institution to have to get in and
 
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
institution to have to get in and
project

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have this
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
methodology and they're going to be
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
those instructors they're just like
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's people in any business
 
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.390 align:start position:0%
there's people in any business
that

01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
go a little bit further than they
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably should
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
instruction is something that i was
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
taught as a teacher there's a line
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
you've got to be able to identify where
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
that line is when you start injecting
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
and imparting your own personal opinion
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask you what party
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're part of
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
but if we use our higher order thinking
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
skills if we use use shared inquiry
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's a way of moving that around like
 
01:31:48.239 --> 01:31:49.030 align:start position:0%
there's a way of moving that around like
this

01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
teacher did that's the history teacher
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
he didn't have to go into that he was
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
wise enough and had enough wisdom so he
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
could change that to a discussion where
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
they were getting at the facts and kids
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
were making up their own minds rather
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
than injecting
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
his perspective and that's what we have
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
to do as teachers we have to teach we
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
have to get into the facts we got to get
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
into the material but we don't want to
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
inject our own personal opinion
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
and i think we all must concur on that
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
now that's a basic truth i have as a
 
01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.950 align:start position:0%
now that's a basic truth i have as a
teacher

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
there are those folks which are not many
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
but there are some that come in are
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
young and inexperienced and they're
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
quick to push what they think they
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
should be pushing
 
01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:35.669 align:start position:0%
should be pushing
and

01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have that wisdom yet and
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's why we have folks that are you
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
know go through a couple years before
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
they become
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
a teacher that's you know uh the
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
experienced teacher i don't want to say
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
tenured and all that we don't like that
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
word do we represent woodcock but but
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know it there are you learn a lot as
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
you teach
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
so the inexperienced teacher needs that
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
help in identifying
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
the boundaries within instruction that's
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
a that's a given
 
01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.070 align:start position:0%
a that's a given
so

01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to think that we are moving
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
as a country i've i voted in support of
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see anybody seen as the
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
oppressor or the oppressed and all this
 
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.750 align:start position:0%
oppressor or the oppressed and all this
uh

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think we've just gone too far with
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
injecting this into our schools i think
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that the kids can do this themselves and
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
they will if we don't if we as adults
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't get in the pathway and mess it up
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
so those my own two cents words of
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
pearls of wisdom i guess
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes uh inquiry of the chair
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um on um just looking at 354 a
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
colon 31
 
01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.550 align:start position:0%
colon 31
and

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
would your read on that be that
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
would also apply to um
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think look at that where are you yeah
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
you're reading something that i don't
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
have yeah i'm looking at 831 so one of
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
one of the statutes that why don't you
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
read it
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
so so that that this law would would
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
begins with no public employer either
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
directly or through the use of an
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
outside contractor shall teach advocate
 
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.790 align:start position:0%
outside contractor shall teach advocate
extract

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
extract
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
instruct train and you know and it goes
 
01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.229 align:start position:0%
instruct train and you know and it goes
on

01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
but but would uh would this apply to
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
let's say a um
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
a non-public school that was contracted
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
by a school district to provide
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
educational services
 
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
it says public employer
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
it says no public employer so that's the
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
public school the school district either
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
directly meaning the school district
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
employs teachers
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
or through the use of an outside
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
contractor meaning the school district
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
contracts with a non-public school
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i forgot the statute on that 192 22
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
so so so the question is
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
does 354 a31
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
also apply to to a public employer like
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
such as a school district that contracts
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
its its educational services its
 
01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.470 align:start position:0%
its its educational services its
teaching

01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
to an outside contractor either through
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
a non-public school or prendapod or um
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
or a um
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
no public employer in the state of new
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire contracts with a scholarship
 
01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire contracts with a scholarship
organization

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
that then contracts with them
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
with with
 
01:35:39.199 --> 01:35:40.550 align:start position:0%
with with
trinity

01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
trinity
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
school to teach
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
so so um
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know i think the reading on here is
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
that um that that a public employer is a
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
school district for sure a public
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
employer is the state of new hampshire
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that it's basically um
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i think it applies
 
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.270 align:start position:0%
i i think it applies
certainly

01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
much more broadly than um than than just
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
to teachers who are directly employed
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the school district
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the that's the intent of
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
is that the yeah so where are you going
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
with all this so i mean i'm just trying
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
to understand that that um whether
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's the legislative intent of the
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
um because this bill is trying to repeal
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
and um and you know this would seem
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
to to to put more than just uh teachers
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
who are directly employed by public
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
school districts in jeopardy of um of of
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
or the or the or the school district in
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
jeopardy of a violation of this statute
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
and and it would certainly apply to
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
everything that we're doing through 194
 
01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.669 align:start position:0%
everything that we're doing through 194
f

01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
f
 
01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:01.590 align:start position:0%
f
77g

01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
77g
 
01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.709 align:start position:0%
77g
and

01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
and any any
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
contracted relationships that a school
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
district may have with a non-public
 
01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
district may have with a non-public
school

01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
and that this bill here would would
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
actually repeal
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
those connections represent cordelia are
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
you anxious to respond to that yes thank
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
you excuse me yeah
 
01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
you excuse me yeah
um

01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
a 30 uh is definitions and it uh does
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
define what a public public employee and
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
public employer are
 
01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
public employer are
um

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not sure where
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
you're going in terms of
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
um a school district contracting with a
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
non-public school
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
um but you mentioned also the
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization they don't
 
01:37:44.719 --> 01:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization they don't
contract

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
with uh any school no no and and so i
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
was really clear on that thank you very
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
much representative cordelli so the
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
definition in a 30 354 a 30 for public
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
employer includes the state which i
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
talked about and any subdivision thereof
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
which i talked about a school did
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
a school district is a political
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision clearly both are
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
defined in this section as public
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
employers and then it goes on in eight
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
354 a 31 no public employer either
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
directly or through the use of an
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
outside contractor shall teach dot dot
 
01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
outside contractor shall teach dot dot
dot

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
dot
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
so the outside contractor
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
would be the scholarship organization
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
that further subcontracts
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
teaching so so that's one one
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
relationship a contracted relationship
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
the other relationship
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
would be a school district who contracts
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
with a non-public school for teaching
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's clearly covered in a 31 and then
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
the the one that presumably we all
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know believed was there is a school
 
01:38:54.159 --> 01:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
you know believed was there is a school
district

01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
who employs a teacher directly to teach
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's cool
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's pierce that you're driving down the
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
road of the efas here
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
et cetera and and uh
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
where you're going that's not that's not
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
but it is it's part of the law it's part
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
of a 31. well we've had this discussion
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
with the efas many many many times
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
and well again tomorrow and we and
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
exactly if there's going to be a whole
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
host of bills coming up tomorrow which
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we will have this discussion
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
but we've had it during the hearing
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
process as well and i don't believe that
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
we need to get into the discussion on
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
efas when we're discussing this
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill well it's it's efas it's
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
non-public schools it's it's um
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
77g um
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and obviously uh
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
public school districts that that
 
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
that employ teachers directly
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think it's uh it's i i
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a question it's it's
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's here black and white
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
very very plainly stated i know we've
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of discussions about efas but
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh but to be honest um mr chair i've
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
never heard
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
us talk about
 
01:40:10.639 --> 01:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
us talk about
this

01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.109 align:start position:0%
this
statue

01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
statue
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to efas and but from the
 
01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
with respect to efas and but from the
conversation

01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
here particularly on this side of the
 
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
here particularly on this side of the
room

01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
i would have to conclude that you'd want
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
that to apply
 
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:26.950 align:start position:0%
that to apply
to

01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.750 align:start position:0%
to
to

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
every type of
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
education that is regulated by the by
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:35.189 align:start position:0%
the state
so

01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-public school contracting with a
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
with a um with a public school uh uh uh
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
service provider contracting with an efa
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
i mean you wouldn't want them teaching
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
any of these things either right
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned 77g which is the tax
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
um similar to
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
efas the education freedom accounts
 
01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.189 align:start position:0%
efas the education freedom accounts
funds

01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
from either go to
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
the family
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
the family then
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
makes an agreement with a service
 
01:41:10.639 --> 01:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
makes an agreement with a service
provider

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund does not
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
contract with anyone
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing educational
 
01:41:19.679 --> 01:41:21.750 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing educational
services

01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
religious schools along the way
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
you should take a look at 354 a 18 which
 
01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.350 align:start position:0%
you should take a look at 354 a 18 which
is

01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
an exemption that has a
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court and all sorts of court
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
basis for exemptions for religious
 
01:41:39.119 --> 01:41:41.910 align:start position:0%
basis for exemptions for religious
organizations

01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.109 align:start position:0%
organizations
so

01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know i don't see that
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
the point is applicable to 354 for the
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization when it comes
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
to tax credit scholarships or to
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
the education freedom accounts so so um
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli so so the the earlier reference
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
that you said it's clearly not part of
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
this this block of of uh freedom from
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination um um
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
and um uh and i think and thank you very
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
much for the clarification with regards
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
to 77g
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship accounts i guess i was not
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
aware that that money went from the
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization directly to the
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
parent as opposed to through the
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to the the
 
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.669 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to the the
contracted

01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
education service provider that sort of
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
brings up
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
additional questions about the
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
scholarship program that would not be
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
relevant to 1576 but i think the um i
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
think the connection that um that that
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
that um that 354 a 31 has
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
um to um to to
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
as a requirement on public employers
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
which include the state or any
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
subdivision thereof
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the scholarship
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
organization is the subcontractor of the
 
01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.950 align:start position:0%
organization is the subcontractor of the
state

01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
and service providers are subcontractors
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization because
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony here that that's
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
in fact how how this is being done
 
01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.750 align:start position:0%
in fact how how this is being done
um

01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
there are certainly instances where
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
non-public schools are contracted by uh
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
which are clear enough um public
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
employers um as as a political
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
subdivision as defined in in a 30 that
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
um that that that this this is pretty
 
01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
um that that that this this is pretty
clear

01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we we haven't heard from i mean
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
we've we've we've heard from a lot of
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
organizations on um uh on the substance
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
of 1576 and the substance of the current
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
law you know including teachers we've
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
heard from aclu we've heard from new
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
futures we've heard from school board
 
01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.310 align:start position:0%
futures we've heard from school board
members

01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.669 align:start position:0%
members
um

01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:57.679 --> 01:43:59.189 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
and many others and um
 
01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:02.629 align:start position:0%
and many others and um
but

01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
but i i think it's it's it's very clear
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
here that um that the current law
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
also applies to uh non-public schools
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
and um and uh organ service providers
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
that are contracted through scholarship
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
organizations i don't see how you read
 
01:44:19.590 --> 01:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
it any other way
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
well just for a point of clarification
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
the education tax credit those monies
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
are not state monies to begin with
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
and when we're talking about the efas i
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
i think we need to sit down and
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
have an education lesson here on on on
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
how the money uh is transferred down
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
um that's worthy of another discussion i
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to try to
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh correct some of your insights or your
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
perspectives and how they're not
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
insights there were the words
 
01:44:50.719 --> 01:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
insights there were the words
well

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
words matter right
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
well we've heard that statement before
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
are you done here with uh we're on uh
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
1576 here so if we repeal if we repeal
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
this by passing this then then all of
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
that connection goes away
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%

i think that this
legislation

02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
confusion

02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
confusion
and

02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
would undermine the human rights
 
02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.149 align:start position:0%
would undermine the human rights
commission

02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
by transferring some

duties that now belong with the human
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%

of education
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know how they would
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
deal with what is proposed
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%

chair if um
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
if um and i know i know there's a the
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
the pending motion is itl and so
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
so we're not in a in a place where we
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
can introduce uh make a motion but you
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
may discuss but we may discuss so if if
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
if it's okay i'd like to
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
just pass it over to linda to do that
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:15.990 align:start position:0%
doing this
um

02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
has i have an amendment for it it was a
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
little confusing
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
in the beginning but the the amendment
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
that i passed around i hope makes it
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
clear that my
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
intention on this is to
 
02:05:30.079 --> 02:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
intention on this is to
extend

02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
extend
 
02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.149 align:start position:0%
extend
the

02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
protections for discrimination
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
not only to our public schools but to
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
any entity receiving public funding in
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh public school private school
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
approved schools for tuition programs or
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
educational vendors
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
the reason that this bill
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
was originally
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
set forth
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
takes what the public schools have to
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
abide by and what our state has to abide
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
by in employment and housing and extends
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
it uh to
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
wherever we're extending uh public
 
02:06:10.239 --> 02:06:11.669 align:start position:0%
wherever we're extending uh public
education

02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:06:11.679 --> 02:06:12.470 align:start position:0%
education
and

02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry that uh the person from the
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
human rights commission
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
and i didn't get a chance to actually
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
discuss this bill beforehand we we
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
played phone tag for about a month i
 
02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
played phone tag for about a month i
think

02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
and um essentially
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
is based on housing
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
and employment practices whereas the
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
department of education's job and the
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
school board's job
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
role is to protect students
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
and to oversee the public school system
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh and the public and the education of
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
our children
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i think that
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
um even though uh she went into quite an
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh explanation on things that certainly
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
this law does not interfere with her
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
work at all
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
in fact it complements it and extends it
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
and on the
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
reverse side of it
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
it gives the role of the state school
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
board and the department of education
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the role to oversee
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh that discrimination is not happening
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
within their purview so and um
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
i hope that this uh amendment clears
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
at least a little bit up on the
 
02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.390 align:start position:0%
at least a little bit up on the
intention

02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
intention
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh for the bill thank you
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh is there
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill we've we've had
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know on a amendment that's not been
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
introduced but it is available for you
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:07:43.679 --> 02:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
to look at
um

02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
allow in the discussion
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
discussion going either way either on
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
that you know amendment or or on
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
primarily we have to address the bill
 
02:07:54.639 --> 02:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
primarily we have to address the bill
itself

02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh we have spent a
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time this morning
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
how to make sure that people are not
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
discriminated against i think this bill
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
actually complements that discussion
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
by extending the
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
rights of non-discrimination to
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
places other than just the public
 
02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
places other than just the public
schools

02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and again i'm going to ask the same
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
question today that i asked during the
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
hearing last week and that is
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
why would we not expect the state board
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
of education
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
to follow the same anti-discrimination
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
language that we have placed into law in
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
a multitude of other places when i read
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's uh
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and the language in it
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
um the protected classes are the same
 
02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:56.149 align:start position:0%
um the protected classes are the same
that

02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
appear in any of the updated laws that
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
so it looks to me like this is a
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
housekeeping thing in terms of the state
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
board of ed
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:13.599 --> 02:09:15.350 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
lady that we heard from
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah was saying that it was that would
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
complicated or confusing because
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
education was added
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.639 --> 02:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
purview

02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
purview
 
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.589 align:start position:0%
purview
and

02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about oh we need to extend
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
this to all these places it exists
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere you need to go back to 354 a1
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
which says this chapter shall be known
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
as the law against discrimination it
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
will be deemed an exercise of the police
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
power of the state for the protection of
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
the public welfare health and peace of
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
the people of the state
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
and in fulfillment of the provisions of
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
the constitution of this state
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
concerning civil rights it then goes on
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and and lists all of the
 
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know the things that shall be
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
discriminated used to discriminate and
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
to say that they're therefore setting up
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
a state agency
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
created with the power to eliminate and
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
prevent discrimination
 
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.990 align:start position:0%
prevent discrimination
and

02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it does say places of public
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
accommodation housing accommodations etc
 
02:10:31.119 --> 02:10:31.990 align:start position:0%
accommodation housing accommodations etc
but

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
education was added to that and that's
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
what she said she's now in charge and
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
does deal with the education as well so
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
taking that away from the organization
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's set up to deal with this and
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
putting it back on the state board of
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
education obviously the state board of
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
education has some responsibility
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
anyways because we all do
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
based on this but
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
it should be in the purview of the
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
organization that was set up to deal
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
with it they have the lawyers they have
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
the expertise
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
they have the people that investigate
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
they have all that stuff yes she sat
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
here and gave us all of those things and
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
she said she was not in support of this
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
because she already does this and and um
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
we'd just be
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
messing it up
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
representing luna
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair uh first of
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
all director malika did not say that she
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
was not uh in support of it she she
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly brought up the fact that um
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
that 354
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
a has uh has a number of sections that
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
could potentially um
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
overlap with uh with with even the
 
02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.790 align:start position:0%
overlap with uh with with even the
existing

02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
law that uh that that that this bill
 
02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
law that uh that that that this bill
isn't

02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
intended to amend
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
but but when you take a look
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
specifically and director mallika did
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
did testify to this
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
that 354 a colon 27 the opportunity for
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
public education without discrimination
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
a civil right
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
only applies to public schools it does
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
not apply
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh the same way we were talking about
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
the last the last bill to public
 
02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:12.790 align:start position:0%
the last the last bill to public
employers

02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
and subdivisions and content
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
and organizations that contract to to uh
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
to the state and subdivisions this
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
the section that that the director uh
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
specified a colon 27
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
only applies to public schools the
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
in the the current statute that that
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is amending 86 colon 11
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
also currently applies to public schools
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
ensure that there shall be no unlawful
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination in any public school and
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
what the bill goes on to do is to amend
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
that so that it's not just in any public
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
school but any
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
private any entity that's receiving
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
public funding
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
public funding a public school private
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
school approved school for tuition
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
programs or an educational vendor
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
um so so in fact the the
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
does not overlap with the uh with the
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
human rights commission's um charge
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
and statutory um uh requirements in a27
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
it um specifically extends the existing
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that the state board has to
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's guaranteeing
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh no unlawful discrimination not just
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
in our public schools but in any of the
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
the educational environments that are
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
that are uh being paid for by public tax
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
dollars so so
 
02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:51.589 align:start position:0%
dollars so so
it's

02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's not inconsistent with um with the
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
human rights commission's work it's not
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
in contradiction or in
 
02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
in contradiction or in
or

02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
or overlaps with it and it certainly is
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
something that uh is clearly an
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
oversight in the um in the existing
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
law uh for the state board so i i think
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
we should all i hope we can all support
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelia
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:22.149 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:22.159 --> 02:14:23.589 align:start position:0%
um
by

02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
putting this language into statute
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
and applying it to private schools and
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.599 --> 02:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.750 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's fuzzy the way it's written the
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment makes sense
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm looking at it right i
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand yes right um it would it
 
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:50.709 align:start position:0%
understand yes right um it would it
would

02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
in uh in effect
 
02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:53.669 align:start position:0%
in uh in effect
um

02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
do away with the
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
exemption for religious organization
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's in the human rights
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
statutes 354 a18
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
that is well founded in court decisions
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
and basically
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
i can read it to you if that's all right
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it's not too long
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
354 a18 exemption for religious
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
organizations nothing contained in this
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be construed to bar any
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
religious or denominational institution
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
or organization or organization operated
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
for charitable or educational purposes
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is operated supervised or
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
controlled by or in connection with a
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
religious organization from limited
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
to or giving preference to persons of
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
the same religion or denomination or
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
from making such selection as is
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
calculated by such organization to
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
promote the original religious
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
principles for which it is established
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
or maintained
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
by implementing
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
or moving forward with 1607
 
02:16:06.550 --> 02:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to education um this
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
exemption for uh religious organization
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
would uh basically be bypassed and um
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i i think that based on
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
on on that um based on the fact that um
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know i i don't know if
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else has heard any problems um
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
anyone has uh complained about with the
 
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
operation of the human rights commission
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
um but i
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
i see no reason for um 1607.
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative tanner
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then representative waltz
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair and under 186
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
colon 11 the duties of the state school
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
board of education
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
under sections 33
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
it clearly states discrimination the
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
school board and i'll just it it says
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
the state board of education shall at
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the chapter ensure that
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
there shall be no
 
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
unlawful discrimination in any public
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
school against and it goes into all the
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
different areas that i've gone in so
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
obviously between that and title ix
 
02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
obviously between that and title ix
discrimination

02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
statutes the school district and the
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
department of education has dealt with
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
and deals with this issue and refers
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
these issues to
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission if they feel
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but it should not be
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
passed the the ideal on this should not
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
be based on the fact that the department
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
of education cannot handle this or the
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
state school board cannot handle it i
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
would also remind us that
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
in our constitution uh in part one
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:51.509 align:start position:0%
there's um
there's

02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
a section that says that no person shall
 
02:17:54.319 --> 02:17:55.910 align:start position:0%
a section that says that no person shall
be

02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
no citizen shall pay for religious
 
02:17:58.399 --> 02:18:00.230 align:start position:0%
no citizen shall pay for religious
education

02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so there's some question that there
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
are some hazy areas
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is talking about
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
public education paid for through the
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
state so thank you
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
representative waltz thank you um i'd
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
just like to address what representative
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
cordelli said and that is
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment here that's before me in
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
no way abrogates section 18 that
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli read to us it's
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
still fully in effect however
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
if an institution chooses to cha take
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
public monies then there are limitations
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
on discrimination but if they don't take
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
the public monies section 18 is fully in
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
effect this does not make section 18 go
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
away in any way
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
so i think that was misleading and i'd
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
just like to make clear that we're only
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
talking here institutions that take
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
public monies and we as a governmental
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
body have an institut have an interest
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
in regulating people who take public
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
monies in the kind of discrimination
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
does public money include public
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
services in a private school i'll give
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
you an example the fire department comes
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
to a private school
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
the fire department is paid by
 
02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:25.589 align:start position:0%
the fire department is paid by
taxpayers

02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
issue i don't believe so i think money
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
means money well they have
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
so that would you wouldn't have a
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
problem with that happening with the
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
fire department going to a school
 
02:19:43.439 --> 02:19:44.950 align:start position:0%
fire department going to a school
correct

02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay now one other example if you don't
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
mind uh for our full declaration my
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
son's a catholic priest
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
and his church put on
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
a shelter in the church for the homeless
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay i know it's a little different from
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
schools but if a school also goes on and
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
collects money to give
 
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
collects money to give
to

02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.070 align:start position:0%
to
a

02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
black orphanage or some particular group
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that a problem too if they take some
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
money from something crazy i don't know
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
buying a new projector or new safety
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
defibrillator or something
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
so i you lost me a little bit in this
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
between collecting money and and taking
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
money i mean so for example
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
if a school accepts money for example to
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
pay say a physical therapist that's
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
clearly taking money okay if you've got
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
a local volunteer fire department coming
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
in and doing an anti
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know a stop drop enroll program for
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
first graders
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think that is accepting public
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
money but i do think that if we've got
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
public money paying say for a physical
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
therapist at a school that is accepting
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
public money and and i'm not quite sure
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
where you're i couldn't understand your
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
question to see where you were trying to
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
draw the line but i hope that clarifies
 
02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
draw the line but i hope that clarifies
it

02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you i i can understand where i'm
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
very confusing i apologize for that to
 
02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:01.670 align:start position:0%
very confusing i apologize for that to
everybody

02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
but just concerned where this would lead
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
where you draw the line from public
 
02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:07.510 align:start position:0%
where you draw the line from public
money

02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
and money that is used by a private
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
school you're encouraging somebody if
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
they accept the money don't or don't
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't take any uh student who could have
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
reading this uh you know you don't want
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
anybody who has a mentally disability
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
because uh you take public funding if
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
you got some on a private school they
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
gave you some money or a teacher goes in
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
and if if you had somebody severely
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
emotionally ill severely do they have to
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
take a student in if they take money at
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
private school
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
and you're somebody with severe psych
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
i've seen this
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
on a special ed teacher most of my
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
career some severe psychological issues
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
because it'll be money indirectly you
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
know what i'm not over my skis and i'm
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
not going to answer that because i don't
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
know the the short answer to that and
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
and you know i i i don't know
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
to answer that special one has special
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
rules and i i don't know how they apply
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
and if if i understood that you know i'd
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
answer it but i just don't know that's
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
fine i accept that
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah just uh clarification on
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
on that and i'm not an expert on in this
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
area and um and i think this
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
conversation could probably benefit from
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
having somebody like attorneys ellen
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that but specifically to
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
represent nelson's question about
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
student with special with an iep
 
02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:32.309 align:start position:0%
student with special with an iep
that

02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
the district of residence is responsible
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
for those iep classes i wouldn't
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
consider that to be funding
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
a private school if if the student was
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
was was placed there
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
through something other than a parental
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know i think a parental placement
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
negates that but then that's not public
 
02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
negates that but then that's not public
funded

02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
in that case but um
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
but but i think the i think the the
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
here and representative tanner correct
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
me if i'm if i'm
 
02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
me if i'm if i'm
mis

02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
mis
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
if i misstate this but any entity
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
receiving public funding
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
so so um and that's that's not through
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know candy sales or or something
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
like that but um but you know with a a
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
contract with a um with a
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
let's say a school district to provide
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
services for those um uh for those
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
students and being being funded to
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
provide those services as opposed to um
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know paying to have those those
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
services provided by the resident
 
02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.469 align:start position:0%
services provided by the resident
district

02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'd need a little clarification i can
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
remember as a
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
school principal i received title 1
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
monies which are federal dollars
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
and within the requirements or the
 
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:57.349 align:start position:0%
and within the requirements or the
regulations

02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
i was required to provide service to the
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
private school up the road with some of
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
those dollars some service
 
02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:06.389 align:start position:0%
those dollars some service
now

02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
the dollar stopped at my door
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i employed
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
a remedial reading teacher
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
with title one
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
some of those dollars i believe at that
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
time required may not be now but
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
in years ago i then had to provide some
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
support to the private school which was
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
just up the road
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
is that is that that's a service though
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
but that's not
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
money flowing
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that would not come underneath
 
02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:37.670 align:start position:0%
so that's that would not come underneath
this

02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
as you're you're you're okay
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
okay represent like us
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
is an unintended consequence of this
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
let's say a private school
 
02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:54.150 align:start position:0%
let's say a private school
is

02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
has taken in placement students
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
who have
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
certain disabilities and they're fine
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then but now they're taking public
 
02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
and then but now they're taking public
money

02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
because they have students who are going
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
there that are be paid for publicly that
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
they have taken in
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
if i'm incorrect let me know but if
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're taking students that are paid for
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
by the district
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
is that not public money
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then if you you then cannot turn
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
down a student that you don't feel you
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
have the you that you could
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
address properly right and so
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
when we put this law in the unintended
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
consequences if you say no you have to
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
take this student because you take
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
public money that those private schools
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
are going to say fine we won't take any
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
students so that then we won't be taking
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
public money and that's going to hurt
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
all the students that they turn away
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to have to take
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
every student regardless representative
 
02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:59.590 align:start position:0%
every student regardless representative

02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i would disagree with the
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
thinking of representatives because
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
it can't turn away that's not what
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're talking about they're talking
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
about they can't discriminate
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i find this this i'm looking at the
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
amendment which clarified the original
 
02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:13.429 align:start position:0%
amendment which clarified the original
bill

02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
that makes it a little clearer i i just
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
have a really hard time to understand
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
why would we want to not pass this when
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
all it says is as a group we don't want
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination for any reason in schools
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
public or private that's what this says
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
so if you don't agree with that then say
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay let's discriminate
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's the part that really concerns me
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is really a simple piece that's
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
just expanding that everyone's covered
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i was so it's just that's i find it
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
hard to understand why would we why we
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
would not want to embrace this uh
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
representation's original bill and
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
particularly her amendment
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you

02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of public monies and
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:06.550 align:start position:0%
going to
religious

02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
religious
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
educational organizations and the
 
02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:10.389 align:start position:0%
educational organizations and the
exemption

02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
section 189 colon 49
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%

02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
school board of any school district to
 
02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.190 align:start position:0%
school board of any school district to
provide

02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
funds to
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
any non-public school in in the area for
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
nurse services etc
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
and that does happen
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
in hampton
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
sacred heart school has
 
02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.190 align:start position:0%
sacred heart school has
been

02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
awarded in the 40 45 000 range
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
annually based on a school warrant
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh article
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
money um
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
from this description of one of the
 
02:27:55.359 --> 02:28:00.389 align:start position:0%
from this description of one of the
articles

02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
it specifies funds to help cover a nurse
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
education technology supplies and
 
02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
education technology supplies and
textbooks

02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
textbooks
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
so they received
 
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.429 align:start position:0%
so they received
uh

02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
clearly public funds
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
um and they are a religious institution
 
02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:21.270 align:start position:0%
um and they are a religious institution
um

02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
again i i think that
 
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.429 align:start position:0%
again i i think that
um

02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
the exemption in 354 18
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
would certainly be in question whether
 
02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
that would apply in this case if this
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
legislation is passed
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
we would have a lot of
 
02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
legal difficulties
 
02:28:46.399 --> 02:28:47.429 align:start position:0%
legal difficulties
if

02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so does this does that mean
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
that that those institutions
 
02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:58.150 align:start position:0%
that that those institutions
are

02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
are discriminating or against uh the
 
02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
protected classes under new hampshire's
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
no but
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
in hiring for instance
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want to hire
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
someone with um
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
a belief system contrary to their
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs
 
02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs
um

02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
issues like like that there there is in
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
all sorts of legal precedent um
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
this exemption for religious
 
02:29:42.399 --> 02:29:49.110 align:start position:0%
this exemption for religious
organization

02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh represent tanner can you please
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
what what do you mean by educational
 
02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:56.950 align:start position:0%
what what do you mean by educational
vendor

02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
is there a definition for that term
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i haven't
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
researched back through
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
ols did not research back through but
 
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
typically vendors are people that
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
are organizations that are contracted
 
02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:13.349 align:start position:0%
are organizations that are contracted
services

02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
by a school district and
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
we know that now school districts can
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
contract out and and
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh do provide educational services
 
02:30:23.439 --> 02:30:24.389 align:start position:0%
uh do provide educational services
through

02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:30:24.399 --> 02:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
through
um

02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
non-profit and for-profit vendors vendor
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
is a commercial entity i would say that
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
offers services
 
02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:35.830 align:start position:0%
offers services
okay

02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative mullen then would i can
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
answer that question uh
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
with regards to what an educational
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
vendor is yeah we
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
have tutoring agencies in town
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
that offer after-school tutoring
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
services to parents but they also
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes offer programmatic things
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that a school district could actually
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to work
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
with a student if they were
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
so inclined to need a math tutor or a
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
science tutor or whatever
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
that would be considered to be an
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
educational vendor because they wouldn't
 
02:31:14.319 --> 02:31:15.030 align:start position:0%
educational vendor because they wouldn't
be

02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
an employee of the public school system
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
but they would be hired by the public
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
school system to perform some sort of
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
task or skill with a student
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you see represent woodcock then
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
represent moffitt i want to thank
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative mullen for taking my
 
02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
representative mullen for taking my
answer

02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
but beyond that but beyond that we won't
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
hold any grudges later
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
but be honest the other part is as
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative and we all are well aware
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
many school districts
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh contract with private particularly in
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns private schools and
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to send a youngster
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
from a public school to a private school
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
under the school board authority we know
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
that but once again i want to go back to
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
this this is talking about why would we
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:32:04.870 --> 02:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
send a student to a school a school
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
public or private with our funding
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
knowing they discriminate that's the
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
whole point this just says you can't
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate this is really simple this
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
just says you can't discriminate
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're either for discrimination or
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're against it it's simple this is
 
02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:21.429 align:start position:0%
you're against it it's simple this is

02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.439 --> 02:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
um it's a type of bill or legislation
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
that weaponizes uh attorneys to uh you
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
know target certain schools or programs
 
02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:33.910 align:start position:0%
know target certain schools or programs
uh

02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the hearing it came up i brought it
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
up there were a couple of uh small
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
public charter schools that only cater
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
or allow girls
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
so if this were to pass speaking of
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis's point about
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's i don't know that would happen
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
hope it would not but i could easily see
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who identified this admits his
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
gender identity so someone who
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
identifies as a female wanting to go to
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
that school but forget that
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
if this school is exclusive to males
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
a flat out male could cite the statute
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
and say i need to be in this school i
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
want to be in this school it's in my
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that's where i want to be
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
and this law says i need to be at this
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
girl school that's
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah that that was my point is
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not just discriminate or not
 
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
discriminate because it has that phrase
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
shall be no denial
 
02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:32.710 align:start position:0%
shall be no denial
which

02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:33.750 align:start position:0%
which
um

02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the benefits of their programs or
 
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
activities and that's the sticking point
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
and for me it's it's and i know there
 
02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
and for me it's it's and i know there
are

02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
still girls schools i believe
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
i was told there are still some girl
 
02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:48.750 align:start position:0%
schools in the state
 
02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
schools in the state
[Music]

02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
but for me it's more the
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the mental or
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
physical disability because some schools
 
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
are not prepared
 
02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with certain
 
02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
to deal with certain
disabilities

02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:06.550 align:start position:0%
disabilities
and

02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
we've seen we've heard from parents
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
who've said that their child was turned
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
down from this public school and that
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
public school and then that private
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
school it happens there are school
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
schools just say i can't we don't have
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
the facilities we don't have the setup
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
we can't do a good job educating that
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
child based on that child's particular
 
02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:29.349 align:start position:0%
child based on that child's particular
disabilities

02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
and so the concern is
 
02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
if this passes because they then can't
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
deny based on that
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
that they will just say all right i'm
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
taking no public money which means i'm
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
not taking those kids that i can service
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's the point that's the critical
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
piece that's in here that makes it
 
02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:51.990 align:start position:0%
piece that's in here that makes it
untenable

02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
untenable
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
is the no denial to any person
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of the program
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and so it says either you have to take
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
everybody whether you can handle them or
 
02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
everybody whether you can handle them or
not

02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:05.349 align:start position:0%
not
or

02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
schools are likely to say then i'll take
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
nobody and that's the limiting that's
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequence and that's
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
the language in this that isn't just
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate or not discriminate
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes we just can't handle
 
02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:21.270 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes we just can't handle
certain

02:35:21.270 --> 02:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
certain disabilities we've seen it we
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
know we've heard one mom multiple times
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh opposition is to words that are
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
already in statute
 
02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
already in statute
but

02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh director malachi clearly stated that
 
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are exemptions for same-sex
 
02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:44.230 align:start position:0%
there are exemptions for same-sex
schools

02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh that there are exemptions under the
 
02:35:46.479 --> 02:35:47.270 align:start position:0%
uh that there are exemptions under the
law

02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
and and exemptions that people can apply
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
for to run an all-girls school or an
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
all-boys school so i think that that
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
kind of covers that little area of it
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
and as far as disabilities are concerned
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
we have the americans for disability act
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
and we have special education
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and i think what you just
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
described would be illegal
 
02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
if a public school denied
 
02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.830 align:start position:0%
if a public school denied
the

02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
person to come in because they had a
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
special need they have to find
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
accommodations for that that is that is
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
under the law the the sending
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
organization sending district and
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but i believe
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
this sending district has to provide
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
accommodations in some respect maybe not
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
at that public school maybe they send
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
them they have out of
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
out of uh school tuition programs for
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
them but they they have to take care of
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
that child they can't just throw them
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
out on the street because they aren't a
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent likus
 
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's not what we've heard and that's
 
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
not i mean one mom who came and
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
testified multiple times but i've heard
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
it from other parents and read it from
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
other parents as well that their kids
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
are denied
 
02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
from public schools
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then from private schools that mom
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
said her school
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take her son
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
the neighboring public schools wouldn't
 
02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
take her son
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the private school wouldn't take her
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
son because none of them could
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
accommodate him
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
and she's now homeschooling so
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
if it's the law it sure isn't being
 
02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:28.150 align:start position:0%
if it's the law it sure isn't being
enforced

02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
our open enrollment
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
states

02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
open enrollment schools may select
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
pupils on the basis of aptitude academic
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
achievement or need
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
provided that this is selection is
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
directly related to the academic goals
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:55.670 align:start position:0%
of the school
so

02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
so
that's

02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%

yes i do
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
first off i don't see an amendment and
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
one of the issues was within three days
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
of receipt is that school days or not
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
but the other part in the part that for
 
02:40:50.610 --> 02:40:50.620 align:start position:0%
me is the most compelling
 
02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:52.710 align:start position:0%
me is the most compelling
[Music]

02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
the parent is supposed to go first by
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
law now to the superintendent
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
and if the superintendent is the one
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
initiating the discrimination
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
as we have seen happening
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
in a number of school districts and we
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
did have that one speaker come in with
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
scads of of um documentation and she
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
sent us a whole bunch of stuff if we
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
the parent will not want to go to the
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent for fear of retribution
 
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
against their child
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
and the other thing we keep talking
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
about oh well these civil suits and
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
whatever let me tell you a parent is
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to do everything they can first
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
because civil suits cost money you have
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
to hire a lawyer etc they're not just
 
02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to indiscriminately say oh i'm
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
just going to go do a civil suit no
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
there have been plenty of people already
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
upset at
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
school districts etc who have not
 
02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
a filed suit because it costs money that
 
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
so they are going to go through all the
 
02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:06.150 align:start position:0%
so they are going to go through all the
appropriate

02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
and if it's not the local superintendent
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
they will go there first because they
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend that money unless
 
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
they're not getting satisfied any other
 
02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:19.750 align:start position:0%
they're not getting satisfied any other
way

02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
way
but

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
this would make into law that they need
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
to go first
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
and if the superintendent
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
as i said is the one
 
02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
as i said is the one
pushing

02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:35.030 align:start position:0%
pushing
then

02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
and there have been parents who have
 
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
spoken and said that then their child
 
02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:43.190 align:start position:0%
spoken and said that then their child
was

02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
given a hard time discriminated against
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
bullied whatever because the parent came
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
and complained
 
02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:51.990 align:start position:0%
and complained
so

02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to make it law that they
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
have to go to the superintendent that's
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative hobson do you have any
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion no i have nothing to
 
02:43:03.359 --> 02:43:04.150 align:start position:0%
further discussion no i have nothing to
add

02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
add
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh luna thank you very
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
much mr chair so you know this this
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
certainly built um
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
1638 builds on a lot of our discussions
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
that we've had throughout the morning
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i think it does so in a very
 
02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
practical and pragmatic way
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
it provides a um
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
a process
 
02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:34.389 align:start position:0%
a process
for

02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who feels aggrieved in terms of
 
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
their their um
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
in term
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
somebody that feels aggrieved
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to um
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
their local school board to the
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent to the state board of
 
02:43:53.349 --> 02:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
education and then to the civil rights
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh commission
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
should um should any of the um the the
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%

uh you know
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
have been taught or they feel they feel
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
like they've been aggrieved in those
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
those those earlier sections
 
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
and it really and it replaces the uh
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
really the the part that i think puts
 
02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
the greatest chill
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
in um in the band in the band content
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
um in the censorship is the onerous
 
02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
remedy that's currently in statute in
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%

02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
parts gets repealed and um and and what
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
gets put in place i think is a very well
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
thought out um
 
02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:10.950 align:start position:0%
thought out um
um

02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
escalation through your local school
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
board the superintendent state board of
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
education and the civil rights
 
02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
commission to um uh to have your um your
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
your your your case adjudicated and um
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that will help take the
 
02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:26.070 align:start position:0%
and i think that will help take the
chill

02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
chill
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
out of um out of these the banned cons
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
concepts act thank you thank you
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative mullin
 
02:45:35.269 --> 02:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:45:35.279 --> 02:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
sitting here listening to the argument
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
i'm struck by the idea that certainly
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
there have to be cases where
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents parents find fault with
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and there has to be
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan at the local level in
 
02:45:56.309 --> 02:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
place for situations like that i would
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
ask representative litchfield if she
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
would mind
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
putting on her school current school
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
board hat
 
02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
board hat
and

02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
educating us about what happens in your
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
if a parent has a gripe against the
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent does it go to the school
 
02:46:18.870 --> 02:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
board is there a mechanism for that
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer that but you're
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
can i restate it has has anything ever
 
02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:30.710 align:start position:0%

hampshire law right thank you
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative hobson has anything has
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
there ever been a situation or if
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
anybody else is on a school board that's
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:52.710 align:start position:0%
in the room
um

02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
has there been a situation in which
 
02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:57.349 align:start position:0%
has there been a situation in which
the

02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
offending party was the superintendent
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
because i can speak a little bit to what
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
has happened
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
in the past in bedford but i'm not a
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh uh we have the department
 
02:47:15.359 --> 02:47:16.150 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh uh we have the department
here

02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
do you have you ever had a parent
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
come and say i'm i'm just having a tough
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
a tough time you know or there's an
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
issue that's come up and i don't agree
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
with what the superintendent is doing do
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
you advise them to go see their school
 
02:47:36.389 --> 02:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
board or is there any assistance that's
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
given from the department as far as
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.070 --> 02:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative luna with that
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
contingency thing
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
for a lawyer who's never had a client i
 
02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
was pretty good um
 
02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:58.710 align:start position:0%
was pretty good um
so

02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
frank doesn't know that i'm billing him
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i am
 
02:48:04.469 --> 02:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
i see you frank um so yes the the
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
department gets a lot of complaints your
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
question's very uh
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
broad in general um
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
but yes we get complaints about uh
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
superintendents and complaints about
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
individual educators
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
so we would have to narrow down what the
 
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
exact complaint is but yes we have
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
received complaints over the years
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
about individual superintendents and
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking depending on what the
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
we can either assist in that sometimes
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
we assist in having that conversation
 
02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
we assist in having that conversation
um

02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
kind of facilitating that informally
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
or we will refer them to their school
 
02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:46.070 align:start position:0%
or we will refer them to their school
board

02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
so if i have agreements
 
02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and it's dealing with discrimination of
 
02:48:52.389 --> 02:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
some kind and i'm not getting resolved
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
through the superintendent
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
if i contact your office or somebody at
 
02:48:57.439 --> 02:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
if i contact your office or somebody at
doe

02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
doe
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
you may want to set up a meeting would
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
facilitate a meeting with a
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent or would you act as sort
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
of like a mediator in that or so
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
under the current law if it deals with
 
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination we would refer them to
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission okay
 
02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
and that is the that is
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
how the law is currently written and
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
interpreted and the attorney general's
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
office put out an opinion on that in
 
02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:22.790 align:start position:0%
office put out an opinion on that in
july

02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
july
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so that is where all those
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
grievances uh whether they involve the
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent or not would be directed
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
i see and so i don't even know if we
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
would um
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
drill down to the level of who this
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
grievance is actually about
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
those matters
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
under the law is currently written are
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
handled exclusively by the human rights
 
02:49:44.950 --> 02:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
commission thank you does anybody else
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a question representative of the
 
02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
doe yes representative tanner uh thank
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
how many
 
02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
superintendents are there currently in
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire just
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
approximate oh my gosh i'm going how
 
02:50:00.309 --> 02:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
many sausages i'm going to phone a
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
friend and reach out to the nea
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
how many superintendents are there
 
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's got to be over 100 i would say
 
02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i honestly i don't know the number off
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i'm i'm happy to get
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
back to you but but let's say let's say
 
02:50:17.190 --> 02:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's over i think it's over 100 because
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
i think you know the sau numbers at
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
least go up to 90s
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
it goes up to about 120 but some of
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
these are not all of them
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
some of them have superintendent
 
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
services having presented to all of the
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents i can tell you it's at
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
least a hundred if not more okay so um
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
could you give me you say that you do
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
get uh complaints could you kind of
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
quantify that a little bit better uh
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
like on a yearly average would you say
 
02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
one to five five to ten
 
02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.269 align:start position:0%
one to five five to ten
fifty

02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
fifty
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
a 100 how many do you think you get
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to go broadly outside of
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
the claim of discrimination no just
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination just discrimination which
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
i it's hard to give a number because
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
those complaints are given to another
 
02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:10.870 align:start position:0%
those complaints are given to another
agency

02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
we just don't have that
 
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
that number but if i were to
 
02:51:17.429 --> 02:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
based on the very limited interaction
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
and this is an estimate
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm asking for a ballpark figure one to
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
five five to ten i'd say ten to ten to
 
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
twenty okay
 
02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
but again i want to be clear on
 
02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
but again i want to be clear on
discrimination

02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
on discrimination i feel i feel that's
 
02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:38.309 align:start position:0%
on discrimination i feel i feel that's
maybe

02:51:38.309 --> 02:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 okay um but again
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
those complaints are sent to another
 
02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
agency they do not fall within the
 
02:51:48.150 --> 02:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the department of
 
02:51:50.150 --> 02:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
education to adjudicate the department
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
of education will impose discipline on a
 
02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
credential if there is a finding by the
 
02:51:58.230 --> 02:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
human rights commission so and when you
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
just follow
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
so when you talk about that
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
um are
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
are those complaints like
 
02:52:05.279 --> 02:52:06.469 align:start position:0%
are those complaints like
uh

02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:08.469 --> 02:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
that discrimination happened within the
 
02:52:08.479 --> 02:52:09.910 align:start position:0%
that discrimination happened within the
school

02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
came to the superintendent's office
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
didn't um
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that the way
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
the per person that was discriminated
 
02:52:20.319 --> 02:52:21.510 align:start position:0%
the per person that was discriminated
against

02:52:21.510 --> 02:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
so therefore the complaint is against
 
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
the superintendent rather than where the
 
02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
based on that particular fact pattern i
 
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
think there are far less
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay complaints thank you
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other uh
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent hobson
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
fenton for taking my question
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
so currently if discrimination is
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
believed to be going on
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
a person can go right to the human
 
02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
rights commission and fill out a
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
complaint i think we heard miss malachi
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
testify that it was immediately taken up
 
02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:03.910 align:start position:0%
testify that it was immediately taken up
correct

02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if you i can't speak okay
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
or her testimony okay
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
this process would add a significant
 
02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
amount of time to that discrimination
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
accusation for lack of a better word do
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how long this process
 
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
might take compared to
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
going through the civil rights
 
02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
going through the civil rights
commission

02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding i i don't have a set
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
i think you alluded to the answer in
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
your question it
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
as written that law would add an
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
additional step but in terms of
 
02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
comparing the time uh that exists
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
currently to what is proposed i i'm not
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
any other yes represent tanner
 
02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:54.230 align:start position:0%
any other yes represent tanner
so

02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:56.230 --> 02:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so as
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is written
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
what happens to charter schools
 
02:54:01.830 --> 02:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
because there isn't a superintendent in
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
a charter school is there
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh so charter schools as you know have a
 
02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's a
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
coo or ceo i forget to have a laws
 
02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
written without my book i'm useless uh
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
apparently but um no they do not have a
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent but they have the
 
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of one
 
02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:21.750 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of one
so

02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
so would they in in order to be
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh covered by this law since they are a
 
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
public school as well would the would
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
the would this bill have to be
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh amended to include a procedure for
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
specifically for charter schools that go
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
through whatever um and i'm not sure
 
02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:42.710 align:start position:0%
through whatever um and i'm not sure
that

02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
that there are schools perhaps that that
 
02:54:46.830 --> 02:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
same that we contract with maybe that
 
02:54:51.670 --> 02:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't have this have the same structure
 
02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:54:54.309 --> 02:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
as the public schools with
 
02:54:56.469 --> 02:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
superintendents in other words this this
 
02:54:58.710 --> 02:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
has a you know a series going through
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a school board for
 
02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:05.349 align:start position:0%
they don't have a school board for
example

02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
if you were to apply it to charter
 
02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
schools and i i do not have the language
 
02:55:10.469 --> 02:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
of the bill in front of me and i
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but if you were to
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
apply it to charter schools 194b is very
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
clear that unless explicitly stated in
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
other areas of the law
 
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
those laws are not
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
equally applicable to charter schools
 
02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools have their own carve out
 
02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:26.150 align:start position:0%
charter schools have their own carve out
and

02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
this legislative body has dealt with
 
02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
that in a variety of areas
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
making those laws applicable to charter
 
02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:33.990 align:start position:0%
making those laws applicable to charter
schools

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of your other question as to
 
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
other entities in which that can be
 
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
applicable to i'm not in a position to
 
02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:41.030 align:start position:0%
applicable to i'm not in a position to
say

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
we would have to take them
 
02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
on each individual situation
 
02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:46.870 align:start position:0%
on each individual situation
but

02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:47.830 align:start position:0%
but
certainly

02:55:47.830 --> 02:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
the language as written sounds narrowly
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
tailored to involve superintendents in
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
your right to identify that there are
 
02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
other entities that have different
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
terminology thank you so uh in your
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
legal opinion
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh you wouldn't think that this applied
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.790 --> 02:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's not really my legal opinion 194b
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
says very clearly
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
that if a lot were to apply it it i
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact language with me
 
02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
but i i can point you to that language
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
um and it's something this legislative
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
body has dealt with anytime charter
 
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
schools are brought up
 
02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way 194b was was written it
 
02:56:29.110 --> 02:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
has to be clearly uh stated that it is
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
applicable to charter schools okay thank
 
02:56:31.439 --> 02:56:32.389 align:start position:0%
applicable to charter schools okay thank

representative hopson thank you
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman would you like to uh
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
offer some comments yeah we've had a lot
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
of discussion on um discrimination in
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
education today
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
and this uh bill is uh relevant to
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
and at this point in time i i think it's
 
04:20:10.630 --> 04:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's not timely it's uh
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to move forward it with it
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
for several reasons we're going through
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of organization restructuring
 
04:20:20.469 --> 04:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of movement in terms of
 
04:20:20.479 --> 04:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of movement in terms of
administration

04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
we have the president of
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
of unh now becoming the chancellor of
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
the school system as well as being
 
04:20:29.520 --> 04:20:30.790 align:start position:0%
the school system as well as being
president

04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
president
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh with that there's also a lot of need
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
for further understanding of the
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
academic freedom that exists at the
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
university level and uh instruction that
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
results from it and i i think would be
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
premature in our acting on this bill at
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:20:51.269 --> 04:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
hopson any comments no i i would agree
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%

04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative lad's motion for interim
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%

04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill is ready for for prime time
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
i am most likely going to support the
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%

04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
itl on uh on 1313 as well knowing that
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
if uh if in fact there are problems and
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
that are that are a situation that needs
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be addressed that uh that this bill
 
04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
would require substantial amount of work
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh in in um uh in cooperation with um
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%

uh briefly mr chair i actually was

initially going to make an otp
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this this bill if you
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
remember if you look at it
 
04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh would have made it or would make it
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%

right now
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
irsa 195 colon 22 requires a proposal to
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
show signatures of 10
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
of a cooperative district's qualified
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
voters which i i some of us thought was
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
daunting especially some
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
districts would have hunt you'd need
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of signatures
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm not gonna motion otp there are
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
some like uh
 
04:24:20.239 --> 04:24:21.349 align:start position:0%

sb2 towns
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
that may have some different dynamics so
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
anyway uh for that reason i think we
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
need to look at some pieces of this a
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%

04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from a cooperative school
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
districts as we all know is a very very
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
complex issue
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
disillusionment properties
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
where kids go to school et cetera et
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera we've all discussed it
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
and um all these bills uh
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
to act on them singularly is going to be
 
04:26:49.349 --> 04:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
04:26:49.359 --> 04:26:50.309 align:start position:0%
a problem
to

04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:50.319 --> 04:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
to
uh

04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
we need to look at them all and and do a
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
thorough interim study i believe interim
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
study right now would even be better
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
than a so-called commission scene that
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
we could start this right off in the
 
04:27:01.840 --> 04:27:02.710 align:start position:0%
we could start this right off in the
spring

04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
spring
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
comp forward and have people participate
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily on that
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
particular committee as we usually do
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
and get that input from
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
those people have ownership in the
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts be
 
04:27:18.790 --> 04:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
administration be it school board
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
members be it public parents cetera
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can get some resolution
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
on this we've been hacking away at this
 
04:27:28.389 --> 04:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
for years the last time we did it was in
 
04:27:28.399 --> 04:27:30.309 align:start position:0%
for years the last time we did it was in
2017

04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
2017
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
and even at the if you look at that
 
04:27:34.389 --> 04:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
commission report
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
there are still several recommendations
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with disillusionment depending
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
upon the size of your district the
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
number of districts within that
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
cooperative this needs further work so i
 
04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's why i've recommended interim
 
04:27:46.960 --> 04:27:48.550 align:start position:0%
that's why i've recommended interim
study

uh the next bill 1646
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
we have amendment coming here we have
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
not received this amendment this is a
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with cooperative school
 
04:29:07.600 --> 04:29:08.870 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with cooperative school
districts

04:29:08.870 --> 04:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
and let's say we have three districts
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
within the cooperative one district may
 
04:29:14.080 --> 04:29:15.670 align:start position:0%
within the cooperative one district may
have

04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
two representatives
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
the other two districts may have won
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
each the issue was should those people
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
be elected by the people within the
 
04:29:23.920 --> 04:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
be elected by the people within the
district

04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
rather than at large
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that's an issue that we had some
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
i would like us to have the opportunity
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
to look at that amendment and make the
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
decision on that when we get ahold of
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
that at a later date so my
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the group right here
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
is that we not take it up today
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock thank you
 
04:29:48.389 --> 04:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
chairman light can you give us an idea
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just tried to go with that that's
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
what was in the amendment that's it the
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
change in this okay and it does change
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
that and it's definitely a later date
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's in line with what we
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
had been discussing
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
so with that we will jump over this bill
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
and we will go to the next cooperative
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
school bill which is 1679
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the dissolution and repeal
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
of cooperative school districts
 
04:30:21.110 --> 04:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
this was a much uh larger bill
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so i'd like to call upon
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for a motion
 
04:30:25.760 --> 04:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for a motion

uh thank you mr chairman i would move
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
i second
 
04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli do you have any discussion on
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bill yes thank you
 
04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
um as you might recall
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
04:30:44.640 --> 04:30:46.229 align:start position:0%
the original bill
required

04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:30:46.239 --> 04:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
required
a

04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
dissolution of all cooperative school
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
districts and a repeal of the statute
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
by mid-year 2025.
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
i passed out an amendment
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
that i'll just mention
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
that basically makes it optional
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
there would be a vote of the
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district if they
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
voted to
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
remain a cooperative school district
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
fine they can go on
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
within the district if they voted for
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
dissolution they would then
 
04:31:25.590 --> 04:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
be able to follow the withdrawal process
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so it's a uh optional rather than
 
04:31:28.960 --> 04:31:30.309 align:start position:0%
um so it's a uh optional rather than
mandatory

04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh but i i think some of the
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
same issues that uh representative
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd mentioned in terms of 1399
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
apply um here
 
04:31:41.920 --> 04:31:42.870 align:start position:0%
apply um here
um

04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:31:44.000 --> 04:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
and it
could

04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
especially with the amendment uh take
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
more discussion and so that is the
 
04:31:53.110 --> 04:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
reason for my interim study motion
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
is there further comment
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%

your motion
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
famous you briefly uh
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
some concerns about some
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequences with
 
04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
some alternative education
 
04:33:43.600 --> 04:33:44.869 align:start position:0%
some alternative education
uh

04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
situations uh one example
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
in this came up a bit during the uh the
 
04:33:50.480 --> 04:33:51.670 align:start position:0%
in this came up a bit during the uh the
hearing

04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh some alternative education situations
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
involve an apprentice-like situation
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
where in a trade
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
environment where
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
a student would be getting
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you name it whatever
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
special experience they wanted at a mill
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
or a
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
factory or
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
so with this to pass
 
04:34:16.709 --> 04:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
there's a question about whether
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
anyone or everyone that the apprentice
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
type student or someone's getting a
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
trade experience
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
they may come in contact with a good
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
number of people at the
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
trade venue or the factory or the mill
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever you want to call it so
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
because of some
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequences and
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions about that that's why
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:47.109 --> 04:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
i believe there
 
04:34:53.429 --> 04:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
there was an issue also in
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
section 3 lines 15 to 17
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the tax credit scholarship program
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
and someone
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
getting a tax credit scholarship and
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of home education
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
it seems to indicate that
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know i guess the parent in the
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
home would have to get a criminal
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
which i don't think is is going to
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
fly too well with most people and um for
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
that and
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
the reasons mentioned by representative
 
04:35:26.639 --> 04:35:27.590 align:start position:0%
the reasons mentioned by representative
moffat

04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
moffat
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
i agree with the motion
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion from the
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative luno
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%

sort of stunned
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
that um that we're not
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
out to passing this 19 to nothing
 
04:35:44.799 --> 04:35:45.750 align:start position:0%
out to passing this 19 to nothing
um

04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of minors being
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
with adults
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
am i missing something here am i missing
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
something even following the governor's
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
state of the state speech last week
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if members of this

committee are aware i certainly know
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative wallace is aware of what
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences the
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of minors being
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
with adults
 
04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
are now presenting to the state of new
 
04:36:13.279 --> 04:36:14.949 align:start position:0%
are now presenting to the state of new
hampshire

04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
and it's not insignificant
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm
 
04:36:20.551 --> 04:36:20.561 align:start position:0%
really taken back
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
really pain um to to try to think that
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is going to apply to parents of
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
home that are homeschooling their kids
 
04:36:34.719 --> 04:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
home that are homeschooling their kids
um

04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
but but certainly certainly should apply
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to um to students that might be in uh be
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
in apprenticeship programs
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
with um these are kids
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
with with grown-ups with adults and i i
 
04:36:50.561 --> 04:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
with with grown-ups with adults and i i
i'm

04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
i can't believe we're going this route
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative mullin
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know how we can take a a
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
chance on a situation where a child is
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
is alone particularly with an adult
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
for any instructional purposes
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
i mean we have been talking about
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
our uh sort of menu of educational
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities now for a couple of years
 
04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
and it keeps coming up over and over and
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
over again that we need to do something
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
with the background checks
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the unintended
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
consequence isn't a child being harmed
 
04:37:37.750 --> 04:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
i would certainly like to reconsider
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
itlling this bill
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion representatives
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
i agree with all of this the problem is
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
04:37:52.470 --> 04:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know how to do background
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
checks on some of these people excuse me
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's not as we know it's as you know in
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
04:38:01.590 --> 04:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
um it had to do with discussion we had
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
before this entire committee as given by
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
the safety officer
 
04:38:08.551 --> 04:38:08.561 align:start position:0%
so i hope we know it since we all heard
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
it and sat here while he explained it to
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
us so i'm sorry as i know
 
04:38:14.799 --> 04:38:15.510 align:start position:0%
us so i'm sorry as i know
and

04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
some of the rest of us know
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult we don't have that
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
procedure yet for some people because it
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
has to be a government agency
 
04:38:27.189 --> 04:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
that does the background check and if
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
you recall
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
and we've worked on this as you said
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative mullen for a long time we
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a bill in now
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to do this all through
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
the education
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
department it's not done yet we're still
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
working on it when it is done this bill
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
would be very appropriate because then
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
we would have a means and we could say
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
all these people need to go through the
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
doe and get their background check so i
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with the principles
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
of this or anything it's just right now
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we would do it until we
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
get that other bill
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
worked out and then we will have a
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
method and then this will be very
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward and that's my only issue
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we've dealt with that issue for
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
going on four years now
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
we will get it done so that we can have
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
the guy on the construction site
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
know who he goes and gets a
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
and not the supervisor not the one but
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
the other guys on the construction site
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
go and get their background checks and
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
where and how to do it
 
04:39:37.039 --> 04:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
where and how to do it
and

04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
at any rate thank you
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me my only concern is the
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers how to work around the term
 
04:39:49.520 --> 04:39:51.110 align:start position:0%
volunteers how to work around the term
volunteer

04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
and that's my only concern but i agree
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
with a lot of points that both sides
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
have made
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you represent tanner
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes we've been working on
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
this a long time and we've uh in statute
 
04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's actually
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
some explanation about how to deal with
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
volunteers basically what we're looking
 
04:40:09.840 --> 04:40:10.628 align:start position:0%
volunteers basically what we're looking
at

04:40:10.628 --> 04:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
is when a person has
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
contact with a child where they're the
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
only person there
 
04:40:18.788 --> 04:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
or if they're a volunteer if they're
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
there every week
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
working with the same child
 
04:40:22.240 --> 04:40:23.110 align:start position:0%
working with the same child
um

04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
worked this is a this is again
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative lake it's a work in
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
progress it really is and we've we've
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
worked on school bus drivers uh we've
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
talked about substitute teachers in
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
multiple districts
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
not having
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
not having a set
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
procedure in place right now
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
hasn't stopped everybody working on it
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
and getting a procedure in place
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
and it has very much pointed towards the
 
04:40:54.390 --> 04:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
being the clearinghouse for this and i
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
think we can do parallel lines i don't
 
04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
think it's one or the other i think we
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
do parallel lines because that puts
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
pressure on the department of education
 
04:41:06.718 --> 04:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
pressure on the department of education
to

04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:07.840 --> 04:41:09.190 align:start position:0%
to
work

04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
diligently and quickly to get this in
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
place because we're talking about
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know aces we're talking about
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
that literally change the trajectory and
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
the life of these kids
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and we know that there's predators
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
and we know that they
 
04:41:28.798 --> 04:41:29.590 align:start position:0%
and we know that they
see

04:41:29.590 --> 04:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
working with kids and working with kids
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
alone in different areas
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
are you know
 
04:41:36.718 --> 04:41:37.590 align:start position:0%
are you know
prime

04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
prime
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
prime spots for them so uh and we also
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of the companies
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
um for example the construction guy
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
or the automotive technician
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
that their supervisor does background
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
checks but they don't do the chapter
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
five that the ones that we want
 
04:41:59.190 --> 04:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
um they do you know they're worried that
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have uh
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
somebody there that's murdered somebody
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
or somebody there that's you know
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh robbed or
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know that sort of thing they they
 
04:42:12.550 --> 04:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily um have the background
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
checks that hit the different areas that
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with so
 
04:42:19.510 --> 04:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we pass this um
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
and you know let's go forward with this
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and let's you know it's like you
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
said four years let's it's time and
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
we've missed kids
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%

woodcock
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chairmanland i'd like to just
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
to add to the the group from this side
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh i recognize register representative
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
nelson's concern about the volunteerism
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure it's going to be structured
 
04:42:51.030 --> 04:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
expected bill as it is now for
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
volunteers in the school the same way i
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean that's how they do it i i do have i
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
understand also representatives is
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the background check
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the state program the next bill is
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
doing but that bill is a compilation of
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
all the
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
processes and all the all the uh keeping
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
them logged in versus the checking um so
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
that that sort of nullifies that but
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
regardless i do think representation is
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
correct if we pass this now which we
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
should then now just expedite the doe
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
working on that and completing that
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
activity for us
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh and then uh i do respond to
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's interpretation
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
or home school programs or maybe rather
 
04:43:32.070 --> 04:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
than muffin which one but this is the
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
programs that accept students so it's
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
not like a home schooler with mom and
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
dad this is a program where they have a
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
multiple youngsters in their house if
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
they have multiple youngsters in their
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
house they then have an adult with
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
minors and yes they should be
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
back on check there's this this almost
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
to me like the discrimination suit from
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
before this change is nothing this is
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
something very simple
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock yes sir um
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
does the state in this bill that
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the house has to have multiple
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
students or can they be their own
 
04:44:07.280 --> 04:44:09.270 align:start position:0%
students or can they be their own
children

04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
and if it's a person doing their own own
 
04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
children do they have to have a criminal
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
background check or if does it state
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
that if there's other children coming in
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
from let's say the neighbor's house
 
04:44:20.718 --> 04:44:21.430 align:start position:0%
from let's say the neighbor's house
do

04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
do you now have to have a background
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
check well as i read this which is
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
different obviously representative
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
cordelli as i read this it says home
 
04:44:31.590 --> 04:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
education programs that accept students
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
so that means i'm accepting students in
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
my program my children already they're
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the program just because i have 17
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
children that doesn't matter i have a
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
very happy family but those have less
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
children if we bring people in from the
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that's hard to explain
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
rather than what
 
04:44:47.110 --> 04:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
so if i bring children in from the
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor's house i'm gonna have to have
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
a background check that's correct you
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
are now an adult in charge of a minor
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
101 or more than that however yes that's
 
04:44:58.708 --> 04:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
a program you are now benefiting from
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
that like any other contractor which is
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
fine it's probably a great job in your
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
house i'm saying you should have a
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
background check not you particularly
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
okay i i got one other question for the
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee here
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
04:45:16.070 --> 04:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
does that online provider have to have a
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
background check when there does have
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
they have no physical contact with each
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
other now that is a great question
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's the best question today
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
really coming from another principle
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
wow we're elevating ourselves here we
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
know what happens on the internet
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
answered it for me you know part of the
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
predatory uh
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
modus operandi of
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
people who are uh
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
going after children it's often through
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and that's where they groom them
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
until they can meet them so
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's uh definitely should
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
be covered in this
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative waltz and then represent
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
like us
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
just something real quick of an online
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
or a real life application and that is
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
my husband is a merit badge counselor
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
for the boy scouts of course i've had
 
04:46:18.788 --> 04:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
their issues
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
and he cannot do
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
an online zoom meeting with the kids
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get the merit badge without
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody else in the room so i often
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
just i'm sitting in the room so he has
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
another adult in the room but the boy
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
scouts are very strict about that that
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
even an online presence you have to have
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
another adult in the room
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
jefferson like us
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of the homeschool groups it's the
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
same way there's always two peop two
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
adults but i wanted to know if we could
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
have diana fenton come up so that i
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
if she's willing
 
04:46:55.040 --> 04:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
if she's willing
chairman

04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
why the uh general is coming up i think
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
freestyle today on our way up the on
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
line 24
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
it does it does um talk about in-person
 
04:47:05.040 --> 04:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
it does it does um talk about in-person
instruction

04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
so the video piece would be uh
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
in line five yeah both like in person in
 
04:47:11.760 --> 04:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
in line five yeah both like in person in
person

04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you now what what what lines
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
are you talking about there
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
five and 24 representative we're talking
 
04:47:20.240 --> 04:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
five and 24 representative we're talking
about

04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh the in-person instruction as we talk
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
about the video piece
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't mean in prison i mean
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
physically present would be my
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
assumption but perhaps attorney can
 
04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative leakers have the question
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um you've been through all of this
 
04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
and met with the safety people
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
and everything we don't have the safety
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
guy with us today so i was hoping you
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
could answer this question
 
04:47:47.280 --> 04:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
could answer this question
if

04:47:48.550 --> 04:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
for instance we had somebody who's just
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
a homeschooler and they have a group of
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
parents who are homeschoolers
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the parents is meeting doing
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
chemistry say
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
how would they get a background check
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
who would they go to
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
i mean how would we comply with this law
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for the question so my
 
04:48:14.240 --> 04:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for the question so my
understanding

04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:48:17.670 --> 04:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the regulations that govern the
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety and i have to say
 
04:48:21.750 --> 04:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
as a caveat i do not represent the
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
department of safety i just
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
have worked in this area
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
very closely my understanding is that
 
04:48:32.550 --> 04:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
anyone can access the new hampshire
 
04:48:32.560 --> 04:48:34.070 align:start position:0%
anyone can access the new hampshire
record

04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
you could
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
via their portal that they have now they
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
have an internet portal
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
you can look at anyone's record you
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
could go home and look at my record if
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
you'd like to and you're welcome to do
 
04:48:44.878 --> 04:48:46.310 align:start position:0%
you'd like to and you're welcome to do
so

04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
so you can get the new hampshire state
 
04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
record for any purpose
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
when we shift our focus to the federal
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
fbi record which is the nationwide
 
04:48:57.520 --> 04:48:58.708 align:start position:0%
fbi record which is the nationwide
database

04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
database
 
04:49:02.470 --> 04:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
um the regulations that pertain to
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
non-criminal justice purposes and that's
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
the term my understanding again with my
 
04:49:09.430 --> 04:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
caveat still in place is that the
 
04:49:12.150 --> 04:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
dissemination of the fbi record for
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
non-criminal justice purposes is as
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
limited to only governmental entities
 
04:49:18.480 --> 04:49:19.510 align:start position:0%
limited to only governmental entities
so

04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
based on that understanding
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
group of homeschool parents could access
 
04:49:27.680 --> 04:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
group of homeschool parents could access
that

04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
that fbi record they can access the new
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire record
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
i've been wrong before yes a lawyer's
 
04:49:37.590 --> 04:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
been wrong before
 
04:49:37.600 --> 04:49:38.708 align:start position:0%
been wrong before
um

04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
but that is my understanding of how the
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
and will us pushing this bill
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
make you work any faster at the other
 
04:49:50.718 --> 04:49:52.310 align:start position:0%
make you work any faster at the other
one

04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.320 --> 04:49:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
that to me is the best question of the
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
day uh will this make me work faster
 
04:50:09.110 --> 04:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:14.638 --> 04:50:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
here is so
 
04:50:22.550 --> 04:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.310 --> 04:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
this is a role as this committee is well
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
aware that the department is starting to
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
take on
 
04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
the depart the department is starting to
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
take on this role of uh being a
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse house for criminal records
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the idea um
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
the impetus for this came from the
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
recognition that the department um prior
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
to the law passing was issuing
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
licenses credentials to people to teach
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
without running a criminal background
 
04:50:51.120 --> 04:50:51.990 align:start position:0%
without running a criminal background
check

04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
check
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check process
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
was part of their employment but that
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
still put the state agency issuing a
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
license to someone granting them that
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
authority without doing a background
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
check and as a state agency under the
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
leadership of commercial edible
 
04:51:09.350 --> 04:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
we felt as a state agency that that was
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
simply inappropriate
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
licensing people who might not be
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
employable under the section 5
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
violations so we have taken great steps
 
04:51:20.708 --> 04:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
with the help of this legislative body
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
to pass laws to allow us to do that
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
and we are certainly in the process
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
of starting that process
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we are taking the steps to implement
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure by which we do that
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
because anything we take on such as
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
running background checks we have to
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
have the accompanying infrastructure to
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
do it and to do it successfully
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
i think that there is a significant
 
04:51:44.958 --> 04:51:46.070 align:start position:0%
i think that there is a significant
potential

04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
potential
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the department to take on these
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
additional roles
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
um and and i always hesitate to speak on
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of commissioner edelblut but i
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable saying that he would be
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable taking on those additional
 
04:51:57.920 --> 04:51:59.270 align:start position:0%
comfortable taking on those additional
roles

04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
roles
 
04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
my caveat has always been and i've said
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
this to
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we have to have the
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place and up and
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
running effectively
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
before we take on too much
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i say that in this area in
 
04:52:19.520 --> 04:52:21.270 align:start position:0%
and i say that in this area in
particular

04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
because this deals with the safety of
 
04:52:23.520 --> 04:52:24.628 align:start position:0%
because this deals with the safety of
children

04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
and so while i agree with all the
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
comments that have been going back and
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
forth about the safety of children we
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
all agree with that
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
um my concern is simply if the
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
department is tasked with too much too
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
quickly uh
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
and something falls through the through
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
the cracks um
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
children will be harmed and and no one
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
in this room is okay with that
 
04:52:50.150 --> 04:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
so while i think that potential is there
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative tanner and i have have
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
worked on this
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and we know the the bottom
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
line no matter where you come down on
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
the aisle is it is a complicated
 
04:53:02.000 --> 04:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
the aisle is it is a complicated
issue

04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
and so yes
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
the department has that potential i
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
think is a role the department is
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
willing to play um but again i would
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
request for whatever that's worth uh i
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
would request that we just simply have
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
the time to build that infrastructure
 
04:53:17.920 --> 04:53:18.868 align:start position:0%
the time to build that infrastructure
and

04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
happily we'll report back to the
 
04:53:22.470 --> 04:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
committee as to how that is but we just
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
had that law passed this past january
 
04:53:26.310 --> 04:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
january 1st
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we have our rules in place and we're
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
working with our partners at the
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
hurdles to to overcome to make sure that
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
that process can
 
04:53:40.150 --> 04:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen thank you mr
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you attorney fenton for
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question how long has the
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire used the fbi
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
check as part of the background check
 
04:53:54.240 --> 04:53:56.150 align:start position:0%
check as part of the background check
process

04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire or the
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
department of education the department
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
of education
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
so again uh prior to last legislative
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
last legislative session
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the department did not do anything
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
with background checks before we issued
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
a a license or a credential to teach
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether it was state or federal
 
04:54:19.840 --> 04:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
whether it was state or federal
follow-up

04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
so um were school districts
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
accessing the fbi background check or
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
they were able to access yes so pursuant
 
04:54:33.670 --> 04:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
to 189 13 a
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
the law was set up that the background
 
04:54:38.550 --> 04:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
check federal and state
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh transmitting thank you i have two
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions i'll put it on front so i'll
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
have to ask for permission um the first
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
one is
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh just a clarity uh on our
 
04:54:58.868 --> 04:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
interpretation if we get your
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this line
 
04:55:03.430 --> 04:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
where it says home education programs
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
that accept students
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what you think that
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
means and what line are you referring to
 
04:55:08.958 --> 04:55:09.670 align:start position:0%
means and what line are you referring to
uh

04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:09.680 --> 04:55:11.670 align:start position:0%
uh
15

04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
15
 
04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.638 --> 04:55:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.550 --> 04:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
so uh i want to just add on one quick
 
04:55:28.948 --> 04:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
item to representative mullins
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
question so representative mullen school
 
04:55:33.270 --> 04:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
districts could receive the background
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
check federal and state because they are
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
a governmental entity so they fell
 
04:55:40.230 --> 04:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
within that very broad bucket
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
to address your question representative
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
woodcock in terms of your interpretation
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the home education program that
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
accepts students benefiting from
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
scholarships grants or tax credits the
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
if i am teaching my own child
 
04:55:55.110 --> 04:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
would i be subject to this that's a
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
question correct
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
well the question is if you are teaching
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
well the question actually is except
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
students that's the fortunate concern if
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
you accept students from
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
susan's house to come to my house to do
 
04:56:06.160 --> 04:56:08.788 align:start position:0%
susan's house to come to my house to do
that

04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think the way
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's written and it's again this is just
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
one lawyer granting their um giving
 
04:56:17.350 --> 04:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
their interpretation
 
04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
the way i read it common sense wise and
 
04:56:21.430 --> 04:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative waltz you can certainly
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
weigh in um
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
when i read this
 
04:56:27.750 --> 04:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
based on just on its face statutory
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation that i've certainly done
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
given its common meaning except students
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
my argument would be that falls outside
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
of your own
 
04:56:37.920 --> 04:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
of your own
family

04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:56:39.040 --> 04:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
family
but

04:56:40.550 --> 04:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be fair
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
could it be argued
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
that this applies to my own children
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
yes the way it is written there is a
 
04:56:50.390 --> 04:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
valid argument to make that
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you okay follow the second
 
04:56:52.160 --> 04:56:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you okay follow the second
question

04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:56:54.310 --> 04:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of time frames the
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
department's working on the
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
the the start of the thinking of
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
enlarging their infrastructure and
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
framework if this bill uh
 
04:57:06.708 --> 04:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
was cleaned up based on what you're
 
04:57:08.788 --> 04:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the time frame for pat for uh act was
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
701 23
 
04:57:18.310 --> 04:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
instead of 60 days from now
 
04:57:20.150 --> 04:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
would that would that be would that be a
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
figure in your best getting i know you
 
04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
can't commit for the commissioner or doe
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm asking is that a reasonable
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time for you do you think for
 
04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that question and i
 
04:57:31.990 --> 04:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the generosity of the
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
time um yeah the reality is is this
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
the department um has a law in place by
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
which we have to get up to speed um and
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes i think giving us that
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
let's say year and a half
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh i think that is a fair
 
04:57:48.718 --> 04:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
uh i think that is a fair
um

04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of time for the department
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
to get that infrastructure in place
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i would appreciate that thank you
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman you're welcome and
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
while you're here uh diana um
 
04:58:04.230 --> 04:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
what's the definition of volunteer
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
so the definition of volunteer in
 
04:58:06.240 --> 04:58:08.948 align:start position:0%
so the definition of volunteer in
rsa18913a

04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
rsa18913a
 
04:58:08.958 --> 04:58:09.910 align:start position:0%
rsa18913a
is

04:58:09.910 --> 04:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:58:09.920 --> 04:58:10.948 align:start position:0%
is
that

04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:12.550 --> 04:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
that term
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
is not defined in statute
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
that term is defined by each individual
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
school district so there is the term
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
volunteer and designated volunteer and i
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
use those uh terms in quotes
 
04:58:28.150 --> 04:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
a designated volunteer
 
04:58:30.628 --> 04:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
in general terms is someone who has
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
consistent access and opportunity to
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
have access with children
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
in a school district
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
each district defines those terms and
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
their own policy
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so you will see a wide variety of
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
definitions but by a general rule of
 
04:58:46.080 --> 04:58:46.868 align:start position:0%
definitions but by a general rule of
thumb

04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
thumb
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
if i were to go into my my child's
 
04:58:49.120 --> 04:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
if i were to go into my my child's
school

04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
to help with the
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
st patrick's day party
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
i would be a volunteer therefore not
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
subject to the background check
 
04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
if however i were to volunteer on a
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
regular basis teaching
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i would have consistent constant
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
contact with children presumably
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
one-on-one then i would be a designated
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer and i would be subject to the
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
background check and the background
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
check would have the federal and the
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
state component to it
 
04:59:27.750 --> 04:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
so whereas this bill says volunteer not
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer or vote you know
 
04:59:34.550 --> 04:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
is there some confusion as to
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
what type of person we're dealing with
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.440 --> 04:59:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:43.280 --> 04:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

04:59:45.030 --> 04:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
not to add on to the words matter debate
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
but the terminology
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
the terminology is critical and what
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen time and time again
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
especially in education is the
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
terminology is sometimes not consistent
 
05:00:04.230 --> 05:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
and when there is that inconsistency
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
then it causes problems later on and so
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
18913a uses the terms volunteer and
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer and those are given
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
deference to the the local districts to
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
define those as they see fit
 
05:00:20.788 --> 05:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
um and so when we
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
look at this bill
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
using the term volunteer is there
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
possibility for confusion
 
05:00:28.320 --> 05:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
possibility for confusion
and

05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent terminology
 
05:00:34.390 --> 05:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:00:37.990 --> 05:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
question are there other departments in
 
05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state government
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
that actually handle
 
05:00:47.590 --> 05:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
these types of criminal background
 
05:00:47.600 --> 05:00:48.390 align:start position:0%
these types of criminal background
checks

05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
checks
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
like health and human services for child
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
care or
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
does the transportation department of
 
05:00:54.878 --> 05:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
does the transportation department of
transportation

05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
handle for
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
their group and i think
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
department of environmental s
 
05:01:04.948 --> 05:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
maybe does camps somebody does camps
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's not under d.o.e but aren't there
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
a few
 
05:01:11.590 --> 05:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question um
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge the
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
does oversee child care licensing
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that is for i think it
 
05:01:24.550 --> 05:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
is for not only the entity
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
but also for individual providers i know
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
that that particular area falls outside
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
the purview of the department of
 
05:01:29.920 --> 05:01:31.110 align:start position:0%
the purview of the department of
education

05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:01:33.750 --> 05:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
um the issue is to camps that was moved
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
recently from dhhs and i think it is you
 
05:01:38.470 --> 05:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
are correct with environmental services
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
the other agency that popped into my
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
head during this during your question
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
was the office of public licensure
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they actively are
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
involved in doing the criminal
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
background checks i don't know if they
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
are but they work with groups
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
that do those so for example the nursing
 
05:01:53.360 --> 05:01:54.550 align:start position:0%
that do those so for example the nursing
board

05:01:54.550 --> 05:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
the nursing board would would run a
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
background check before issuing a
 
05:01:57.760 --> 05:01:59.110 align:start position:0%
background check before issuing a
license

05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
to a nurse and oplc is a regulatory body
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
that oversees any complaints
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up um so
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are procedures in in place people
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
in different departments have been doing
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
this for
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
quite a while right and and the
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
department of education actually
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't completely devoid of doing
 
05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
background or getting involved with
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of at least training the
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
superintendents how to read the
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
background the criminal background
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
checks as they came in or when they were
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
getting a yes or no kind of thing
 
05:02:35.670 --> 05:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
so as the law has changed
 
05:02:35.680 --> 05:02:36.788 align:start position:0%
so as the law has changed
um

05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
we have recognized that need to provide
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
trainings to the superintendents and so
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it was representative mullen
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
who successfully passed a bill last
 
05:02:45.680 --> 05:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
who successfully passed a bill last
session

05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
to require the department of education
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
to do trainings for superintendents that
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill had come up previously to
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
representative mullen bringing it
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
forward and it was itled i believe um
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
it was not successful in its passage
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you are correct that the department
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
is playing a more active role in this
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
general area but i would
 
05:03:11.430 --> 05:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
i would put forward that
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
doing a training on how to read a
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
background check
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
is very different
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
than receiving
 
05:03:21.430 --> 05:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of background
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
checks and having to process those those
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
are two very separate entities
 
05:03:28.708 --> 05:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
um and one of them requires significant
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for it to be successful
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i thoroughly appreciate that i just
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
felt as though your other statement kind
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
of sounded like we didn't do anything
 
05:03:39.270 --> 05:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
with them but you did so
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
well you know i think anyone who knows
 
05:03:41.760 --> 05:03:42.550 align:start position:0%
well you know i think anyone who knows
me

05:03:42.550 --> 05:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:03:44.708 --> 05:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
knows that this has been near and dear
 
05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
to my heart for many years and when i
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
started at the department
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
i was very taken back taken up back at
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
the information that was being
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh provided to school districts to make
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
these important decisions pertaining to
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
who has access to children um
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
that was troubling and the department's
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
role in
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
issuing a credential
 
05:04:09.510 --> 05:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
to an individual to teach without doing
 
05:04:11.670 --> 05:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
the background check i found equally
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
troubling and everyone in this room can
 
05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
agree with that concept so we have taken
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of active steps
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
to involve ourselves in this process and
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
you are absolutely correct about that
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
my hesitation to which that's what
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
you're picking up on is simply
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is a new task
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
being given to the department
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to succeed at it and this
 
05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body wants us to succeed in
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
it and to do so we need time to just
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
create that infrastructure to make sure
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to fall through the
 
05:04:46.868 --> 05:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
cracks i don't like when state
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
government builds the plane as we're
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
flying it
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
and that's just based on my own
 
05:04:51.280 --> 05:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
and that's just based on my own
experience

05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead um just thank you for all the
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
work that you've done on this issue
 
05:04:58.320 --> 05:04:59.430 align:start position:0%
work that you've done on this issue
really

05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
it is my pleasure and despite uh our uh
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
lack of success it was very fun to work
 
05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
with you on that committee on criminal
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
criminal histories
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
just to wrap this thing up with you
 
05:05:10.638 --> 05:05:11.910 align:start position:0%
just to wrap this thing up with you
diana

05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
diana
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of your
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
i cannot i cannot opine
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
as to this bill
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
to do so would be just to step outside
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
of my lane
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up on that yes go ahead so
 
05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
i guess the flip side of that then with
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
the programs that this bill applies to
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
where where there are no criminal
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
background checks being being provided
 
05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
on on for adults who are working with
 
05:05:51.430 --> 05:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
children are those programs ready
 
05:05:54.070 --> 05:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that statement of no
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
background checks are being provided to
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
adults i don't know if that is across
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
the board
 
05:06:02.550 --> 05:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
accurate i think that this area is very
 
05:06:02.560 --> 05:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
accurate i think that this area is very
complex

05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
complex
 
05:06:06.550 --> 05:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the ability to break this bill into
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
its its various parts to identify the
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
concerns of this legislative body is
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
a task worth undertaking
 
05:06:18.390 --> 05:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up on that yes so would it
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
would it make sense then ms fenton to
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
maybe tap the brakes
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
on on some of these programs if um if in
 
05:06:28.550 --> 05:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
fact the department cannot unequivocally
 
05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
say that that
 
05:06:30.638 --> 05:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
say that that
no

05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences are going to
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
happen to children who are in the
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
presence of adults
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
well as i've testified previously
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
commercial edelblut and i have this
 
05:06:44.550 --> 05:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
discussion anytime we roll out any of
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
these new programs so i can assure you
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
that that is always our top priority um
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
but when you look at what can be housed
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
with the department of education
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
and what is being asked of the service
 
05:06:57.680 --> 05:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
and what is being asked of the service
provider

05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
those are nuanced questions and those
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
are certainly worth debate by this
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body but if
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
implication is that these programs are
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
rolled out with no thought to the safety
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
of children and the
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
implic implications of that that is not
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
an accurate statement and that is
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
something that each of these programs
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
has identified in various ways to
 
05:07:22.718 --> 05:07:23.670 align:start position:0%
has identified in various ways to
address

05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
sure sure but but what would be an
 
05:07:27.910 --> 05:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
accurate statement though is that the
 
05:07:29.830 --> 05:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
programs get rolled out while the
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
department is still trying to figure out
 
05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
what to do as far as compliance with or
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
as far as providing criminal background
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
checks and if
 
05:07:38.550 --> 05:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
and if
 
05:07:40.948 --> 05:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
a child's safety is
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
the primary concern
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh it seems at least from how the
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
department has has has been conducting
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
itself that rolling out the program is
 
05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
the primary concern and that the
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
too i'm not sure if there was a question
 
05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.550 --> 05:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
perfect okay well good i didn't hear a
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
question mark um
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna stick with my prior testimony
 
05:08:13.680 --> 05:08:15.350 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna stick with my prior testimony
uh

05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:15.360 --> 05:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
uh
and

05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
in all of our discussions um child
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
safety has always been the number one
 
05:08:21.920 --> 05:08:23.270 align:start position:0%
safety has always been the number one
priority

05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
priority
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
the role the department plays in that
 
05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think has shifted dramatically over
 
05:08:31.110 --> 05:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
the past five six seven years
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
and i think there's an enormous amount
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
of opportunity for what role the
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
department can play should play and will
 
05:08:38.868 --> 05:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
play in the future
 
05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to working with this
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
legislative body to enact that the
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
department's only request is that we are
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the fact that we are going
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
from the department plan zero role in
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks to taking on
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
a significant task
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
and while we stand ready and able to do
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we need the time and the resources
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
to do so successfully
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's the department's position okay i
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
got one last one for you here
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
sorry melissa
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
on lan line 19 it talks about
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
alternative programs for granting credit
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
leading toward
 
05:09:17.760 --> 05:09:20.708 align:start position:0%
leading toward
graduation

05:09:20.708 --> 05:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
when we're approving these when the
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
department is approving
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
a program
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
that will lead to
 
05:09:30.320 --> 05:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
that will lead to
credit

05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
is there not a process which also vets
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
you know as we do every public school
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
are the employees
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
are background checked
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes that's part of the rules yes that we
 
05:09:49.670 --> 05:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
have absolutely and i think when i
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
testified previously on this i brought
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
up the
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
the rules for that particular program i
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
don't have them in front of me right i
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
understand yes i understand that thank
 
05:09:58.400 --> 05:09:59.910 align:start position:0%
understand yes i understand that thank
you

05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
chairman just just to be clear for me um
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
so on that last question chairman ladd
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
the rules that under the uh alternative
 
05:10:12.550 --> 05:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
program you folks just discussing the
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
rules are full background checks for
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
state police that type of piece
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
or it's just a partial doe review
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
i would have to look at those rules but
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
a requirement for
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
background checks pursuant to 18913a
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
because that is always our standard
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is to the best of my understanding
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
incorporated within the rules
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you very much
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions of uh
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
tourney fenton
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
you got your fourth star today
 
05:10:46.150 --> 05:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you well uh representative ford
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
said i should ask that what be in
 
05:10:50.110 --> 05:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
writing not just verbal so
 
05:10:50.120 --> 05:10:52.390 align:start position:0%
writing not just verbal so
[Laughter]

05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay we're back to discussion as a
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee here is there any further
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
discussion on this representative mullen
 
05:11:03.910 --> 05:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is whether or not um
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
we have a motion is the motion itl
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
my question is whether or not we're
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
delivering the wrong message by
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
indicating that this is an inexpedient
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation without considering
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
interim study and just at least keeping
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
it on the burner
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
as a priority area
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
for not only this committee but also for
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
the department of ed i and i'm open to
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
that suggestion um there's
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
we all want to have children safe
 
05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
but you know i in looking this initially
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
my first was overlooked at 60 days
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
getting this done can't do that
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the terminology that
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
i couldn't explain
 
05:11:49.110 --> 05:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
but i think after this discussion it'd
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
be wise that we would draw the itl
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
motion and put forth an interim study
 
05:11:56.948 --> 05:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion but the
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
makers the motion would be the ones to
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
have to pull that back
 
05:12:02.550 --> 05:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
who made that motion mr chair you
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be putting words in my mouth
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
would you uh
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
you made it mike
 
05:12:10.150 --> 05:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh as a maker of motion i i uh
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
given reps and moans comments and also
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton's uh i would withdraw
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
the itl motion in favor of an is motion
 
05:12:19.510 --> 05:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
if i could get a second
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah who made the second
 
05:12:22.560 --> 05:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
yeah who made the second
gun

05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
gun
 
05:12:26.550 --> 05:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
i can care okay so the motion's off the
 
05:12:26.560 --> 05:12:27.670 align:start position:0%
i can care okay so the motion's off the
table

05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
table
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
so you withdrew it right
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay so
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
represent would you like to make a
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
motion please
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh no no no yes sir i i make the motion
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
for interim study thank you very much
 
05:12:45.430 --> 05:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
is there a second to the interim emotion
 
05:12:47.760 --> 05:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
is there a second to the interim emotion
reps

05:12:48.550 --> 05:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
reps
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
represent hops and you made the motion
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the table for
 
05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
interim study made by represent mullen

05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
sure oh no no just just just real quick
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
um um we we were
 
05:13:15.830 --> 05:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
um representative tanner and i were
 
05:13:18.070 --> 05:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
knocking around this idea for a little
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
bit as well
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
and um and uh i personally i feel very
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
strongly about
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
that we should um move forward with an
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and if there are little tweaks or i mean
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
or or put this off and bring back an
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to push the um push the
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
effective date out 90 days
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
um or push it out till
 
05:13:40.718 --> 05:13:41.830 align:start position:0%
um or push it out till
to

05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
july 1st
 
05:13:43.280 --> 05:13:44.788 align:start position:0%
july 1st
2022

05:13:44.788 --> 05:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
2022
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
that could certainly be done
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think the other material parts in the
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
bill i think are very strong and and put
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
child safety first
 
05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
um but that all said
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
um uh i'll i'll support the um the
 
05:14:01.590 --> 05:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
05:14:01.600 --> 05:14:02.390 align:start position:0%
interim study
uh

05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can um because we're
 
05:14:07.270 --> 05:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'll support the interim study just
 
05:14:09.030 --> 05:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
because i think an itl is just a
 
05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
terrible um
 
05:14:10.958 --> 05:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
terrible um
uh

05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%

okay

05:15:30.550 --> 05:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah 1594 relative to assistance to
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
certain students with disabilities and
 
05:16:00.150 --> 05:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to open this up the discussion
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
first before we
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have a motion made on that
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and why i'm doing this is that
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
there are some strengths in this and
 
05:16:16.708 --> 05:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
there's also some issues and i'd like to
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
bring them forward
 
05:16:20.948 --> 05:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
i see section one or
 
05:16:23.350 --> 05:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's one a new section then you have
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
roman one and roman two within
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'm having some problems with roman 2
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
where if you comply with this
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
then you
 
05:16:38.788 --> 05:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
and if you offer assistance to
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
all kids in the school
 
05:16:41.760 --> 05:16:42.948 align:start position:0%
all kids in the school
then

05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have to necessarily
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
go through with
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.280 --> 05:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
we heard that there were a number of
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
schools that are probably doing this
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
right now i don't know if they're doing
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
it in their iep but i know they're doing
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
it and registering or getting kids
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with how to register
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the social studies programs
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the schools some are doing it some
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
are not
 
05:17:08.708 --> 05:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
so i just like to open it up right now
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
for a little bit more discussion on this
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill because you know there's some
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
things in it which are not bad yes
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
represent cornell
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think in testimony we heard that it
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
was a standard discussion in iep when
 
05:17:23.190 --> 05:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing transition
 
05:17:26.550 --> 05:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
when a student on an iep is is at that
 
05:17:26.560 --> 05:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
when a student on an iep is is at that
age

05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
age
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's standard
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
iep language to to talk with them and
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
about voting
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
so i i think
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
is it sop standard operating procedure
 
05:17:41.440 --> 05:17:42.150 align:start position:0%
is it sop standard operating procedure
for

05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
a kid that has
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
any kind of an iep or is for those that
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
are having
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think would be any high school
 
05:17:59.190 --> 05:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
not this one
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think it would be any any student
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
whose iep has a transition
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
program in it
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
not all ieps have transition good
 
05:18:10.400 --> 05:18:15.910 align:start position:0%
not all ieps have transition good
programs

05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:18.070 --> 05:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that in this bill represent
 
05:18:18.080 --> 05:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that in this bill represent
cornell

05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
cornell
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
a transition i plan program or a plan
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.440 --> 05:18:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:18:28.480 --> 05:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
chairman
yeah

05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
relative to that question i think on
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
line 14 maybe the answer
 
05:18:34.560 --> 05:18:35.990 align:start position:0%
line 14 maybe the answer
um

05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
because it talks about the youngsters
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
with ieps as long as they offered
 
05:18:41.190 --> 05:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate assistance by the school
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
which would be what we've been asking
 
05:18:42.878 --> 05:18:44.470 align:start position:0%
which would be what we've been asking
and

05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:48.320 --> 05:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
line 13 says students with disabilities
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
are going to be get the assistance they
 
05:18:52.958 --> 05:18:54.788 align:start position:0%
are going to be get the assistance they
need

05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead reps i'm on
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative vlad um
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
so when i read this
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
section one uh asks for
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
some very specific actions to be taken
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
and that is that when the iep team
 
05:19:17.680 --> 05:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
and that is that when the iep team
convenes

05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
convenes
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
so that would be all of the people that
 
05:19:22.550 --> 05:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
are knowledgeable about the student the
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
students parents and the student
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
that when that iep team convenes at the
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
time between the age of 17 and turning
 
05:19:32.480 --> 05:19:33.750 align:start position:0%
time between the age of 17 and turning
18

05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
18
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
that they shall excuse me shall discuss
 
05:19:38.788 --> 05:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not voter registration is
 
05:19:38.798 --> 05:19:41.190 align:start position:0%
whether or not voter registration is
appropriate

05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:19:44.070 --> 05:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
and if so when and how it's going to be
 
05:19:44.080 --> 05:19:45.670 align:start position:0%
and if so when and how it's going to be
accomplished

05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that a goal
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
and you know iep goals are specific
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
entities that a goal actually be written
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
into the iep it also references uh
 
05:19:56.718 --> 05:19:58.150 align:start position:0%
into the iep it also references uh
students

05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
who have section 504 plans as well
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that that is an important
 
05:20:08.550 --> 05:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
feature because uh
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of time kids who have 504 plans
 
05:20:14.230 --> 05:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
that don't have
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
a case manager that is dedicated to a
 
05:20:19.350 --> 05:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
small number of students sometimes it
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's the school counselor that has
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
75 kids on 504 plans i mean i think that
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
the idea that all kids who are in
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
special service programs are indicated
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
here is really quite important to this
 
05:20:33.600 --> 05:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
here is really quite important to this
bill

05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
i also
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
many of you know that in a previous
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
iteration of myself
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
that i ran uh the special olympics
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
program in the town of bedford so i
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
a ton
 
05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
of young adults who were transitioning
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
between high school
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
graduation and the workforce
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
and one of the classic complaints of
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
these young adults and their families
 
05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
was that sometimes people underestimate
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
the talents the strengths the
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and knowledge that our
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
disabled young adults have and i think
 
05:21:14.718 --> 05:21:15.590 align:start position:0%
disabled young adults have and i think
that

05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
making them part of their
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
civic privilege and responsibility of
 
05:21:20.160 --> 05:21:21.430 align:start position:0%
civic privilege and responsibility of
voting

05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
voting
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the most critical things that
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
for this age group
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative i i agree with you um
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
where i'm concerned is that in in the
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
first part we're addressing those
 
05:21:35.280 --> 05:21:36.868 align:start position:0%
first part we're addressing those
youngsters

05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
youngsters
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
that need to have a transition plan as
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
you've said
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
written right into the iep and that is
 
05:21:44.548 --> 05:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
help than i see in section two if you
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
have somebody coming in several times
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
during the course of the year
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
and working with all students right then
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
that will suffice i don't think that
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
does suffice for the i would agree i
 
05:21:59.670 --> 05:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
would agree with you wholeheartedly
 
05:22:01.830 --> 05:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill then i think that we're
 
05:22:03.750 --> 05:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
mixing kind of like apples and oranges
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
with the two areas there i would much
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
prefer and would support a bill that had
 
05:22:11.590 --> 05:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
section one alone
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then leave it up to the social
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
studies teacher in the administration
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
and locally decide whether we're going
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
to bring them in and i hope you do bring
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
somebody in to help with teaching kids
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
that voting is your constitutional right
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
and this is how you do it
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i i could support this it was
 
05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
amended to leave that second part out
 
05:22:31.990 --> 05:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and and stay with part one yeah if i
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
had to make a guess i would say that
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
that was put in
 
05:22:38.788 --> 05:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
as sort of a
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
nice nice consideration for schools that
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
are already doing some things but
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
i i section one i think is gold that's
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
the guts gold yeah
 
05:22:52.080 --> 05:22:54.310 align:start position:0%
the guts gold yeah
yeah

05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
so if the committee is supportive of
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
where i'm coming from i'd like to delay
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
any action on this bill until we can get
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
an amendment which deals representative
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
if you would
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
that addresses section one
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i do not see
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
if that if we have some concurrence on
 
05:23:18.240 --> 05:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
if that if we have some concurrence on
that

05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
rick i think that's yeah we're good with
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
