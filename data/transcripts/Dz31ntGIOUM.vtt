with this committee is
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of the participants that are on
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.830 align:start position:0%
the committee
have

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
rare diseases themselves
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
and because they're immunosuppressed uh
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh under the coveted uh problems that
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're having at the moment
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to do
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
administrative tasks
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
like passing
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
our minutes we review our minutes each

our minutes we review our minutes each
month

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
and make sure there's any corrections
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
but we can't vote on them because we
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
can't we'd have to have an in-person
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
quorum so our ask is that we can
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
officially meet
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%

introduce the bill
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
briefly the rationale for this bill is
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
listed in the bill itself
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
over half of the membership of the rare
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
disease advisory council is
immunocompromised

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
either from their disease or the
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
treatment for their disease
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
since the lift the lifting of the state
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
emergency we have done our business
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
and continue to meet in a hybrid fashion
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
but we've been unable to obtain a full
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
quorum in person while i don't recall a
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
single controversial vote ever being
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
taken in the history of the rare disease
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
we are not able to administer a function
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
such as approving the minutes
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
allowing this particular council the
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
ability to meet remotely would enable us
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
to continue the work we have been
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
charged to do
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%

thank you are there questions for
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh do you have any
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
idea what you would prefer to see
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
i i really wouldn't know the wording for
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.550 align:start position:0%
yes
so

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
i have no idea the size of the advisory
 
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.269 align:start position:0%
i have no idea the size of the advisory
board

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
but a quorum is
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
expected to be 51 of the membership
 
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
expected to be 51 of the membership
correct

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
just what's your reaction to say he said
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:20.230 align:start position:0%
something like
five

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
members or
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
what could you know physically president
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
could constitute
 
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.069 align:start position:0%
could constitute
or

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
would you rather see us say something
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:29.829 align:start position:0%
like uh
20

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the the size of the board
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
anything would be an improvement put it
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to to say that would be
 
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.710 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to to say that would be
adequate

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes that would be
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
to our advantage to have a lower number
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
what that number would be
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
any as i say anything would be an
 
00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
any as i say anything would be an
advantage

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll tell you we struggle with
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
that all summer we're going to struggle
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:21.509 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
sylvia

00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it was uh out of um house bill um
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
two through uh 237 in uh the 2000 or
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
well with covet it's certainly much more
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh much wider spread and uh
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the consequences of of covet is uh
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
much more sequential
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
consequential uh than the regular flu
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
but yes uh
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
even in the regular sessions there were
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
did not uh come and and meet uh
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis with us for this same
 
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.150 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis with us for this same
reason

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
i thought i got it um
 
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.190 align:start position:0%
i thought i got it um
so

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
the the members of this board um
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
do they not participate
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
in regular life go to doctor's offices
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh shopping um
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
are they are they
 
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
are they are they
so

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
incapacitated uh that they can't go out
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
in public
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
many of them are yes
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
they virtually do have during covid uh
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
they've been homebound they have home
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
delivery for groceries
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh and such uh they do telemedicine as
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
much as as at all possible uh for
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up care obviously some of them
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
get iv medications
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
and have to come to the medical centers
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
they do interact but many of them
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
that are really very seriously
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressed uh
 
00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressed uh
really

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
carry on a very restrictive
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
existence eve even outside the pandemic
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
much representative woods um
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
would you be uh
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
i mean would you be amenable
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
although i don't know whether this could
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
fly through the full house even the
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee to uh using this as a vehicle
 
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
committee to uh using this as a vehicle
for

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
restoring the remote meetings as was
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
done with the state of mercy's effect
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i think pretty successfully um
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
or do you feel like we should just
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
stick with this uh committee with it
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
which has like apparently unique
 
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
which has like apparently unique
considerations

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
my sense is that the council would not
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
like to to
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
proffer themselves as as representing a
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
more general consideration but we have
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
very specific needs under these
 
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.150 align:start position:0%
very specific needs under these
circumstances

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
um and they're very well delineated and
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think pretty well understood by almost
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
everybody that aiming of suppression is
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
a rather significant player in this
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we'd like to leave it as is
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
the next book
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
we do have the prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
here i don't know if he would also like
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
to testify we did hear some of his
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony and
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
do you have a call upon representative
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
marsh to see if he has anything in
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
addition to add uh thank you mr chairman
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely aware of what you
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
already heard uh because i wasn't here
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the room i was introducing another
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill upstairs and i apologize for that i
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
can only be in one place at a time
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
the the this bill was submitted at the
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
request of the rare disease advisory
 
00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
request of the rare disease advisory
council

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
simply because the rare disease advisory
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
council has been unable to make a quorum
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
since the end of the state of emergency
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
because over half of our members are
 
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.069 align:start position:0%
because over half of our members are
immunocompromised

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
we've done our best to carry on the
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
business of the the council in a hybrid
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
fashion but we can't approve our minutes
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
and it would be very nice if we had a
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism of
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
doing the things that we need to get
 
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.310 align:start position:0%
doing the things that we need to get
done

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
done
uh

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
did you read the letter
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
i don't need to be any longer than that
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
because he read my testimony to you
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative marsh
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking my
 
00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.670 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking my
question

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.269 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
it was not officially asked for by the
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
board because we don't have a quorum to
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
hold a vote on anything but all the
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
members discussed it with me offline and
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
ask that we
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
submit it
 
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
submit it
so

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.509 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
i think that sounds like it
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%

any other questions for representative
marsh

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
i get to do
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
my one question is obviously the
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in place now
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
were in place prior to covid
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
the meeting requirements quorum
 
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.069 align:start position:0%
the meeting requirements quorum
requirements

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:49.110 align:start position:0%
requirements
and

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
was getting a
 
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.629 align:start position:0%
was getting a
quorum

00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
problematic before covid
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh no having aquarium quorum is never a
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
problematic before cor before coveted
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
actually we've come pretty close we've
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
come within one
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh attendee of having a physical quorum
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
present where the meeting was held but
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't actually made that quorum
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative marsh
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%

immuno compromise group of participants
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
support their participation and work in
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
which we have seen the work happening
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
during the whole emergency and we feel
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
that that's an option to provide that
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
services for that group so we are in
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%

the bill
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
at this point of time 13 members
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%

the formation of this council
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
how did dhhs look at
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
rare diseases and what was the process
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
we never had a we never had a forum to
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
look at the rare disease this was our
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
beginning of the process
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
and that's where we have put some of our
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
rare disease advisory council has our
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
starting point to look at understanding
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
prevalence of rare disease in new
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well as thinking about how
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
we educate our
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
general public as well as our medical
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
providers and also working with our
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
health insurance providers on how we
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%

know new hampshire and we do not support
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
hb 1013 relative to changing the format
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
of meetings of the new hampshire rare
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
disease advisory council
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
while we are sympathetic to board
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
members that are autoimmune compromised
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
a physical location must be provided for
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
all public meetings
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
this new paragraph amendment to rsa
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
126-a colon 79 allows no physical
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
location to be available
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
additionally if only electronic means
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
are provided this may limit attendance
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
of some members of the public in remote
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
areas that do not have access to
 
00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
areas that do not have access to
technology

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
in nashua the physical location is a
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
critical component of our public
 
00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
critical component of our public
meetings

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
very often before the start of a meeting
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
and after adjournment members of the
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
public engage their ward representatives
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
in dialogue on the business of the board
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
not all members of the public are
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable speaking and participating
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
on the record some choose a more
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
personal face-to-face approach to
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
discuss city matters
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
these social connections are an
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
important part of doing business and a
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
physical location provides a means for
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
this to happen
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
additionally conducting business and
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
negotiating which often happens with new
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislation consists of verbal and
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
non-verbal cueing the body language of
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
our board members signals messaging on
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
voting positions this type of
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
communication can only be captured when
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
meetings maintain a physical location
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
remote access through video means does
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
not always capture the room and
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
telephonic remote access completely
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
eliminates all interpersonal connections
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
and non-verbal communication
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
public business will be practiced like
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
oz the man behind the curtain
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
seeing and hearing the entire elected
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
body is an important part of public
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
meetings for these reasons right to know
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supports public meetings
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
to include one a physical location must
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
be provided
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
two the quorum of the board present in
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
the physical location must be defined by
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
the committee and i'll pause here to say
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
that ordinarily we have supported the
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
physical quorum to be uh 50 plus one
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
half the body
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm sympathetic to what this
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee is saying
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe the gentleman who spoke
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that about half the people
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
could attend but not quite get to the
 
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.149 align:start position:0%
could attend but not quite get to the
quorum

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i would like to think that everyone
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
who can physically be in attendance
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be in attendance
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
board members participating remotely
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
must give a reason why remote
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
participation is required any member
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
participating in such fashion shall
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
identify the location from which the

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%

the committee if access if they cannot

the pandemic hit in 2019 that they were
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
have these meetings and it seems to me
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the situation of having a quorum or
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
getting together is a result of the
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic and i i personally don't
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
support that a pandemic environment is
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
going to be here forever
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
um you know i hate to see legislation
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
enacted that
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
allows this type of remote meeting
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
forever when it might not be necessary
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
there are a number i think there are
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
four or five bills like this for remote
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
meetings and the message from right to
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire is going to be very
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
consistent on all of them to oppose
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
meetings not having a physical location
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.789 align:start position:0%
any questions for
octalano

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
octalano
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um having experienced
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
the the zoom meeting world last year um
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
i did not find the technology
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
actually capable of doing simultaneous
 
00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
actually capable of doing simultaneous
um

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
speaking and hearing it was there's
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
always a delay it's almost
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
impossible to
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
have a real-time kind of conversation
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
like we have here is is that a concern
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
that you have yes definitely and down in
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
nashua where technology is pretty good
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
those problems exist
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
particularly telephonic you have a lag
 
00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:39.909 align:start position:0%
particularly telephonic you have a lag
time

00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
that's significant and um
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know the video has been problematic
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
even a week ago we had major video
 
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
even a week ago we had major video
problems

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
in our meeting and uh you you know
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're just delayed and so it's not a
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
surefire thing and i'm concerned that
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
people from all different areas or more
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
remote areas of the state would have
 
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.230 align:start position:0%
remote areas of the state would have
issues

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.149 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
simpson

00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
simpson
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.870 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
when you were speaking about nonverbal
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
cues and meetings and social
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
interactions that happened before and
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
after meetings i'm
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you can tell me is that
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the right to know statutes that those
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
things are protected in the same way
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
that the verbal speaking is no
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i have another question as well you
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
may follow up
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is actually a
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
different question um and your you said
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
your group is opposed to all bills about
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
rem remote meetings
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if you talked at all about
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
um the difference between a commission
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
like this that has particular members
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
and meets on particular issues to solve
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
particular problems versus
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
a meeting like the nashua town city
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
council that would be um
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
i assume you have a city council sorry
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
if that's not right
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
that would be open to um board of
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
aldermen right
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
would be open to uh all members of the
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
public as opposed to a specific 13
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
members who absolutely needed to discuss
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
business that of course is open to the
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
public but in a different way than maybe
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
a board of aldermen no we consider that
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
all the same way because if it meets
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
the requirements of 91a to be a public
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
meeting and a buy to the law then
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
blanket it falls under that doesn't
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
matter if it's advisory or an authority
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
set up or an agency or a public elected
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
body whether they're appointed or
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
elected if they have to comply with 91a
 
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.470 align:start position:0%
elected if they have to comply with 91a
we

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
that's how we look at this
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chair thank
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
you mr ortolano um
 
00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.230 align:start position:0%
you mr ortolano um
when

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.630 align:start position:0%
when
uh

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
i've um i've seen in your testimony
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
today which and um others they talk
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
about the uh
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
speak informally with uh
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
members of the public body before and
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
after but isn't
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
does that doesn't conflict potentially
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
with 91a which is designed to minimize
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
sort of uh
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
off record uh
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
informal discussion try to get things
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
hashed out as much as possible
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
in public
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
no not at all
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
um because 91a
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
controls communications between the
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
boards such that quorums of the board
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
can't do business outside of meetings
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
but individual members of the public
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
that come in to speak to an individual
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
board member whether it's their ward rep
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
even if they email them those emails are
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
not subject to public disclosure
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
any individual member of the public
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
emailing a ward rep you cannot put in a
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
right to know and get those
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
communications those are communications
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
that are considered private and not
 
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.470 align:start position:0%
that are considered private and not
disclosable

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
disclosable
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
so it's only when it goes to the full
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
body that it becomes disclosed
 
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.590 align:start position:0%
body that it becomes disclosed
so

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
that in communication beforehand is very
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
valuable i came in here and asked not
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
relative to this but several questions
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
before the meeting started to a couple
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the members that were in here
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
super helpful i could get some
 
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.190 align:start position:0%
super helpful i could get some
information

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
a little more about the legislative body
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
a little more about the legislative body
and

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
i did exactly what i would do in a
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
public meeting down in nashua
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
those physical locations apply
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
provide that communication and i can
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
tell you in nashua at the beginning and
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
end of meetings there's a lot of public
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
circulation to individual members of the
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
board to say something or share
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
something many times it may not be an
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
item on the agenda it might be something
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.870 align:start position:0%
coming up
so

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.669 align:start position:0%
so
no

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
unless they're trying to hurt a whole
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
group of the board together and say i
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to influence your vote on something
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's on the agenda today that would be
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
a problem and the board would know to
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
shut that down i've actually never
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
witnessed that so individual
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
communication does not violate the
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
question mr orlano you know i am
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
i am a stroke survivor and i have some
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
physical limitations and i know how hard
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
it is to get around
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
this group
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
the rare disease
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
group um it sounds like
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of the folks that are on that
 
00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:37.430 align:start position:0%
a lot of the folks that are on that
council

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
have mobility issues and mobility
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
problems which are
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
exasperated by the pandemic so i think
 
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.389 align:start position:0%
exasperated by the pandemic so i think
that

00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
these folks should be able to get a
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation to
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
attend and view
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
zoom

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
those are my comments thank you
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily disagree with you
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
because what we wrote here was that we
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
just believe that a physical location
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
should be provided
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
okay and um some level of a remote we
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
support the legislation i can't remember
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
the bill number that allows virtual
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
meetings for the public to participate
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
in we still want the elected body to
 
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.830 align:start position:0%
in we still want the elected body to
have

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
a physical location and if members of
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
that elected body choose to use
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
zoom or telephonic they have to identify
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
why they're doing that
 
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.389 align:start position:0%
why they're doing that
um

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we're very we love the broadened
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
scope of public participation in
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
meetings that has come through
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
telecommunications that's been pretty
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
terrific um
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm sympathetic when i wrote this up
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
i really had no details on this i wasn't
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
able to hear what the size of this
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee is and we i'd had no
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
information on what the struggle was or
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
how close the quorum was it sounds like
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
they're pretty close to getting a quorum
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
and and maybe there should be
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
some board members added that can be
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
that don't are not health compromised
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
that can make that quorum up sometimes
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
bodies are too big
 
00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.630 align:start position:0%
bodies are too big
um

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
to get the quorum you need because
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's 20 or 30 people on them and at a
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
time like this
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
you're struggling to get a quorum
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
because you've made a legislative body
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's too big to get it
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
you got to revisit that and decide
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
whether your commission or your
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
appointed advisory group needs to be
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
langley thank you
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and good morning
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
i you just alluded to some flexibility
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of how you would take a look at
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
the meeting structure
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
i was wondering would you consider some
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
type of a hybrid model that would
 
00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.909 align:start position:0%
type of a hybrid model that would
incorporate

00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
the cheer perhaps of the committee
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
making a decision those who were immune
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
compromised or at high risk for coming
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
into a physical
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
place could attend via video or whatever
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
the form was that was developed and the
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
remaining members would attend a
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
physical location
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
would that be something that you would
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
even consider i can't really speak to
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
that because i'd have to bring it to the
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
group and address that with the group i
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to address it as an
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
individual because i am representing
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
right to know new hampshire any other
 
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:33.990 align:start position:0%
right to know new hampshire any other
questions

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%

testify

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%

you sign a piece of paper and thank you
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
you you're now an athlete agent
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
i looked uh
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the last session to repeal that since
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.150 align:start position:0%
that is
um

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
not a good use of
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
of our time
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
but there was some value in the fact
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
unh the people that will be speaking
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
next i'm sure
 
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.270 align:start position:0%
next i'm sure
um

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
an athlete agent has the potential to
 
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.710 align:start position:0%
an athlete agent has the potential to
harm

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
harm
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
a college through inter indirect means
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
which they wouldn't
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
um which the college would have no
 
00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:51.190 align:start position:0%
um which the college would have no
recourse

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
recourse
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
to that athlete agent without this the
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh the statute
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
which gives them a cause of action
 
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:05.190 align:start position:0%
which gives them a cause of action
because

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.150 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
there are certain
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh rules by the ncaa
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
and other organizations that
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
do things like punish the school if the
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
student does something to become
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
make them eligible
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
an athlete agent
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
depending what they talk about depending
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
what the athlete agent gives the student
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
can put the school in breach of that
 
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.349 align:start position:0%
can put the school in breach of that
contract

00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
this schools wanted to be able to
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a recourse
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
against the athlete agent when the
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
is the cause of those
 
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.710 align:start position:0%
is the cause of those
damages

00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
damages
 
00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.510 align:start position:0%
damages
so

00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
what i'm proposing in this bill
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that we remove the requirement
 
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.630 align:start position:0%
is that we remove the requirement
of

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
of signing up for a registration and
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
renewal of registration and just
 
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.990 align:start position:0%
renewal of registration and just
allow

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that schools to
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
still

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
recuperate the damages
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
so this this will
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
continue to keep the
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
the damages
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
being able to be sued
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
also it strengthens the student athletes
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
also it strengthens the student athletes
right

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
to sue
 
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.190 align:start position:0%
to sue
if

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.630 align:start position:0%
if
the

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
athlete agent does something
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
without warning them ahead of time that
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
this is going to affect their
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility and it harms the athlete
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
they would also be able to sue
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
in this example or in this in this bill
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
but we wouldn't so all of the
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
kind of the point of this is
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
if someone is harmed that they should be
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
to sue
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
and but there's no need to assume that
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
the person is going to be dangerous or
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
anything that the government needs to
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
have the registration for beforehand
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm removing i want seeking
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
to remove the registration
 
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
to remove the registration
aspect

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.430 align:start position:0%
aspect
of

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
this the uh rsa
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
332 j
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
questions for representative ocala
 
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.349 align:start position:0%
questions for representative ocala
yes

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative walper
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question i am some confused
 
00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.109 align:start position:0%
taking my question i am some confused
here

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay because it sounded to me as if you
 
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
okay because it sounded to me as if you
said

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.109 align:start position:0%
said
that

00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
the school could be punished
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
for actions of which it had no knowledge
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
yep or participation yep
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense to me
 
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.430 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense to me
well

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh the ncaa
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
ncaa i'm not sure uh intends to make
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
sense so that is
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh not
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
that is beyond my purview but the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
the school essentially
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
has a contract with ncaa that says you
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
know these students
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
that that you say are eligible at the
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
time of you know the beginning of the
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
school year or whatever
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
they're not going to take any actions to
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
make themselves ineligible if you
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
do then you're going to be punished both
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
this the student can be punished and the
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
school can be punished that they are
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
a part of and
 
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.870 align:start position:0%
a part of and
um

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
the interactions between the athlete
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
student athlete
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
can have the effect of making them
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
ineligible and so the school
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement in this to um
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
or in the current statute to let to let
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the school know within a certain
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time and if
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's damages
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
um be on the hook for them currently
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's how it is written
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
much less of an expert than the people
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
that are from unh and know and know
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
about the intricacies of these contracts
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
and be able to
 
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.829 align:start position:0%
and be able to
maybe

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
give you more information about how
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're indirectly being punished
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
or they're they're
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're being punished for no actions
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
that they've directly taken
 
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.349 align:start position:0%
that they've directly taken
that

00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
is the main reason why they did not want
 
00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:53.430 align:start position:0%
is the main reason why they did not want
this

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
whole statute to be repealed they just
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
want they um
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
rep representative simpson
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
my question representative
 
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.910 align:start position:0%
my question representative
um

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
do i'm not very familiar with this as
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
well but i'm wondering is there a kind
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
of like an education or certification
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
process for um agents of athletes
 
00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:27.109 align:start position:0%
process for um agents of athletes
no

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:28.150 align:start position:0%
no
so

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
i guess that's
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement or education
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
require education requirement or
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
anything for the
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
for getting a license in new hampshire
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
however there are
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
programs for
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to be an nfl athlete agent
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
then yes there is a very expensive and
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
and time-consuming
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
process to become an athlete agent for
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
the nfl or any major team
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
sports however there is
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
now with opportunity of
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
high school and college students to be
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
under the new ncaa rules make money
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
there can be
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
like i could go to an athlete and say
 
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.710 align:start position:0%
like i could go to an athlete and say
hey

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
bob's pizza shop wants to give you 50 or
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
free pizza once a week if you go on
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
their you know uh flyer or something
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
like that and they can make those money
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
deals now without being ineligible and
 
00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
deals now without being ineligible and
so

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
the there's no real education
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for something like that
 
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
requirement for something like that
but

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to be at a high level
 
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.630 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to be at a high level
like

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
in a um
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
mba or something like that there's going
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be requirements to be an athlete
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
agent for those people yes thank you for
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
i guess the question that i have is it
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
if i heard your testimony correctly
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
you want to do away with the requirement
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
current requirement that
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
athletic agents be registered right for
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.990 align:start position:0%
the state
and

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.430 align:start position:0%
and
but

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
the other part your other intent is to
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
make them
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh accountable right for harm
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
that they make because yes retain the
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
accountability right now they're
 
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
accountability right now they're
accountable

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
and in kind of a
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the schools can
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
can recoup damages and the state can
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
can impose fines
 
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
can impose fines
but

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
going forward i'm saying that
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
the school could
 
00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
the school could
or

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
the school could
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
get damages or the athlete agent could
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
get damages the state doesn't really
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
need to be involved
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
with that yeah
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
well i guess it gets to my question
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
right and that is
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
who is an athletic agent
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
so if they're not in some manner
 
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.589 align:start position:0%
so if they're not in some manner
identified

00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
joe

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
joe
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
schmoe who
 
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.670 align:start position:0%
schmoe who
just

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
runs the pizza parlor and gives the kid
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
does he become an athletic agent yes
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
well is that defined someplace in the
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
statute well it's defined yes
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
happy to read the
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
definition section
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
the the definition section is on line
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
one through three of the bill
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
um so all
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
if you just look it's crossing out the
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
yes any person in the name of any person
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
who is compensated because the athlete
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
so if they sign a contract with that
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
person to
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
be paid royalties essentially or a fee
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
part of that contract to benefit from
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
the contract let's say with the
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know pizza parlor if you get a cut
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
of that then you would be the athlete
 
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
of that then you would be the athlete
agent

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
agent
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay and i don't want to
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
sound anal but it sounds like you have
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
to sign a contract
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
which means which implies there needs to
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
written contract
 
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:26.950 align:start position:0%
written contract
so

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
joe pizza man and i give somebody i tell
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
the kid i'm going to give you 50 bucks
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
would that not would that fall within
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
are you are you
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
saying that the pizza place would be
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
they the the
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
because they signed the paper is that
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
well i i thought when i asked a question
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
earlier and he said if joe pizza right
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
gives a kid fifty dollars right to have
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
his face on the flyer
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
does that make him
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
and i thought you said yes to the
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
earlier question so i'm trying so
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
are you are you talking about the pizza
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
person or the pre like uh someone that's
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
facilitating the contract
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
no i was talking about the pizza person
 
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
no i was talking about the pizza person
okay

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
no because
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
under this definition they would need to
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
be compensated so the pizza person would
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
as part of the contract i mean unless
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
they wanted to that's
 
00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:52.470 align:start position:0%
they wanted to that's
don't

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.270 align:start position:0%
don't
they

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think joe pizza is gonna
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
say okay i'm gonna get ten dollars you
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
get fifty dollars for you being on the
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
on the flyer right
 
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
on the flyer right
well

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm presuming that miss pizza man
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
is putting the kid's face on the flyer
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
because he's
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
indicates he's going to get more
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
business right and
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
in that manner be compensated some type
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
why don't i ask a different question and
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
is there a need to do away with the
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
registration does the registration cause
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
any harm in any manner
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.670 align:start position:0%
i mean
harm

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
harm
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the fact that it creates a barrier to
 
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.510 align:start position:0%
in the fact that it creates a barrier to
entry

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
entry
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that there's a fee
 
00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.790 align:start position:0%
and that there's a fee
that

00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
that would also
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
let's say if you want to go around
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
paying fifty dollars for
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
for you know this high school player to
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
be on your
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
on your uh pizza place
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
or you or you want to be an athlete
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
agent for this high school that the kids
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
are only going to get fifty dollars then
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
even a 50
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
and you're gonna get some percentage of
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe ten dollars
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
even a fifty dollar fee
 
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.829 align:start position:0%
even a fifty dollar fee
is

00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
like all of your profits right so or a
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the profits for
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
for an entire school so it would create
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
a barrier to entry to
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
what's going to be a much more
 
00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
what's going to be a much more
um

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
with the new rules a much
 
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.510 align:start position:0%
with the new rules a much
more

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.390 align:start position:0%
more
more

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
down the street or the auto body shop or
 
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.349 align:start position:0%
down the street or the auto body shop or
whatever

00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
those those opportunities
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
may be to
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
to younger or
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
high school students or
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
or what have you and they may now be
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
paid a significant amount of money so
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
the athlete agent trying to get them
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
would also not be making that much money
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
doing that so there is
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
that barrier to entry and obviously
 
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.589 align:start position:0%
that barrier to entry and obviously
anytime

00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
i i think that it's
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
any time that we can remove those
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry into the workplace is
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
good if if they're not necessary
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
for your calendar take my question i'm
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit twisted in my mind
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
here um and the way that i envision what
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
this law says or this lsr says is that
 
00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.030 align:start position:0%
this law says or this lsr says is that
um

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
the athlete
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
can have an agent
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
the agent would be the person getting
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
the residuals for the athlete
 
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.470 align:start position:0%
the residuals for the athlete
correct

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
they

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the age the athlete could go
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
directly to the pizza shop for example
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
and get their fifty dollars directly
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the value add from the athlete agent
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
is trying to go track down those pizza
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay the person that just said hey go
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
talk to the guy that went up that down
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
at the pizza shop right um
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
follow it may i follow up okay so um
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
can an athlete under this bill have more
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.109 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
you might have you know a t
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
tv agent you might have you know an an
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
agent that is trying to
 
00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
agent that is trying to
um

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
get you radio spots maybe they have more
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
connections in that field you could be
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get you sponsorships there
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.349 align:start position:0%
could be
but

00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
there just like any other thing any
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
other thing there can be specialized
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
fields where you know you really want to
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
go to this guy for your pizza shop ones
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
but the auto dealers he doesn't have any
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
connections with so you want to go to
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
talk to someone else right thank you
 
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.950 align:start position:0%
talk to someone else right thank you
absolutely

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
ocala

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
ocala
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks thanks absolutely
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
i have a card which says tom cronin and
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
committee my name is tom cronin i'm the
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
university system i'm here with my
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
colleague sean green who is the
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
associate athletic director for
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
compliance at the university of new
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh thank you for the
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak for a few minutes
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
today on house bill 1023
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe just to clarify at the start
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
so current state statute rsa 332 colon j
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
is a set of regulations that governs the
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
activity of athlete agents those are the
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
folks who have the authority to act as
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
intermediaries essentially between an
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
athlete a student athlete and a business
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
seeking to do business with that athlete
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
right so somebody who can enter into
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
contracts on behalf of etc
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
up until relatively recently it's been a
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
has really sort of changed uh the game
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
no pun intended for uh college athletes
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
right they now have significantly more
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities to develop revenue off of
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
their abilities off of their images like
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
this etc
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
at unh and across the university system
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly supportive of this
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our athletes uh sean and
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
his team have worked diligently to put
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
policies in place that provide a really
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
a broad latitude of opportunity for
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
athletes to take advantage of this
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to changes to nil
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
that has sort of almost broken a dam if
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the ncaa
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
sorry nil's name image and likeness it's
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
sort of a vernacular around that issue
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
broken a dam for the uh ncaa in terms of
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
really just looking at how they govern
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
all of athletics across the country in
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
every division uh we expect i think next
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
week the ncaa is looking at a relatively
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
wholesale rewrite of their constitution
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
that is going to result in uh reviews of
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
policies across the board in college
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
athletics so with all that said i think
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
our biggest ask of the committee on this
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill is perhaps just a little bit of
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
caution before moving forward on this
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
section knowing there is still so much
 
00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.549 align:start position:0%
section knowing there is still so much
change

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
if i could just maybe speak to a couple
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
points first
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
really a thanks to the sponsor uh as you
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned he's been working on this bill
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years and has been
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly communicative with us um and
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to kind of develop what
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
you have before you today
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
we are not necessarily opposed to i
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
think the sponsor's main purpose which
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
remove a barrier of entry to somebody
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
who might want to be an athlete agent um
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the degree the state needs to
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
regulate this you know there probably is
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
some benefit if you read 332 j
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
particularly the first few sections it
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
does talk a bit about an application
 
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.270 align:start position:0%
does talk a bit about an application
process

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
requires agents to talk about their
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
is working with an agent that this
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
person is reputable there's something to
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
be said for that for sure um
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
in its place the way the representative
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
has drafted 1023 does provide we think
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
significant legal recourse both for
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
institutions and for athletes who might
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
be harmed there's no doubt about that so
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly appreciate it he did
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
mention um a new section of statute that
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
actually does create a cause of action
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
for students as well that did not exist
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
before we certainly would be supportive
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
um with that said we'd maybe urge a
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
particular caution on two repeal
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
sections at the bottom of the bill
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
332 j12
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
that requires agents to maintain
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
contract records for five years
 
00:55:43.359 --> 00:55:44.470 align:start position:0%
contract records for five years
um

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know if if the committee moves
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
forward with repealing the other
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
sections of statute
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
or athletes really would have no
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
simple way of doing due diligence on
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
somebody seeking to represent them um
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
requiring an agent to as the current law
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
stands maintain contracts make those
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
contracts uh publicly accessible does at
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
least give a student who might want to
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
engage in an agent an opportunity to do
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
some due diligence
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
not sure that would really be a full
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
substitute for the existing regulation
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
requirement but we do think it would be
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
an important piece to try and leave in
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
there and second is j15 again the
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned right now in
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
law there is a significant civil penalty
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state can enforce
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
currently this section is enforced by
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office i think
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's 25 000 for violation uh again we
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh institutions and
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
athletes would have the opportunity to
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
pursue a case in the court system uh
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
obviously a significant monetary fine is
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
another you know deterrent towards a bad
 
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.390 align:start position:0%
another you know deterrent towards a bad
actor

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
actor
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know i think maybe in summary i
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
would just say
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
while there's a lot of new opportunity
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of confusion as i
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
think some of the questions have uh sort
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
of brought about and at least right now
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
there is a very very thin line
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
between an athlete pursuing nil
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities so the opportunity to put
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
a face on a flyer for the pizza shop and
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
return for 50
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
and a a small misstep that can result in
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
that athlete losing their eligibility in
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
the ncaa entirely that is essentially
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
any conversation somebody that that
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
athlete trusts to resent represent them
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
has with
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a professional
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
career in athletics inadvertently or
 
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.390 align:start position:0%
career in athletics inadvertently or
purposefully

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
purposefully
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
right now i think the monetary benefit
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
for agents as again was discussed is
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
pretty low on some of our nil deals and
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
sean can speak a little bit more to that
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
if there's questions about them the real
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity for agents is that next step
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's bringing an athlete into the
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
professional market that is where an
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
agent can make money there is a
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
incredible incentive for agents to have
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
that in the back of their mind where any
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
misstep before an athlete is allowed to
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
do that can severely jeopardize that
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
athlete's future could jeopardize the
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
prospect of our athletic teams and any
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
other athletic teams in the ncaa so with
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
all that said i think our our urging
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
really is just a little bit more caution
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time to see how the
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
ncaa moves on these um and then some
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
degree of
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps looking at this and other
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
statutes in the future um i miss
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
anything that you'd add to that or
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
if not lesser specific questions yeah
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative silvia
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sharon thank you for taking
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
i see here that this
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
legislation was put in place in 2006
 
00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:29.510 align:start position:0%
legislation was put in place in 2006
2007

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
2007
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
it looks to be untouched since do you
 
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:32.789 align:start position:0%
it looks to be untouched since do you
know

00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
what inspired this legislation in the
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
first place
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's free my time
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's pretty my time as well thank you
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
for the question uh
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
i i do not know the answer to that
 
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.670 align:start position:0%
i i do not know the answer to that
question

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo did you have a
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chair and i have a
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
during um
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:04.950 align:start position:0%
your testimony
um

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
you had said that we should proceed with
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
caution about
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
writing any legislation or um
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
voting on any legislation in in relation
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
to this and is that because of the ncaa
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
changing their rules
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
so this i think is maybe the third time
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the last few years there's been a
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation related to uh ncaa
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
regulations particularly around nil
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
right certainly following the california
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
case a few years ago and as the ncaa has
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
continued to try and figure out the
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
right path forward and i think we would
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
agree with anybody who is frustrated
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
with how long that is taking and how
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
challenging it is for folks like shawn
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
and compliance and our athletes trying
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
to understand the rules they
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
nevertheless are the rules that we need
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
to play by and any changes we make at a
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
local level that put us in conflict with
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately where those bodies come down
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
could be a challenge for our athletes in
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
the future so it is until that
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
environment settles a little bit that is
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that is sort of our request and if i
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
could mr chair a question a question i
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
think you asked at the end of the
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
previous speaker's testimony to our
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
knowledge there
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
isn't a problem right now we agree that
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps a 50 fee uh is maybe burdensome
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
for some but we have we are not hearing
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
from students who wish to have agents
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
who can't as a result of the state's
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
current uh regime around this um
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
and so i think again
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
without a clear and present issue that
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think we would caution that doing
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
anything moving in one direction that
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
then we need to come back and suggest to
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
this or another committee down the line
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
if i could jump in to answer to
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
contribute to that as well
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um i would say the short answer to your
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
question is probably yes the ncaa
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
convention actually convenes today um
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
and as uh thomas pointed out they'll be
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
rewriting the entire constitution the
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
draft has already been published they're
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
not rewriting it they're actually voting
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
to approve it and then once that
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
constitution is approved
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
they will begin rewriting
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
entire sections of the ncaa rule book
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we all have to follow um and so as
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
a result of that there will be a lot of
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
change coming in the next few months
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me i thought do you have a
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
they have stated that these rules would
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
be in place by august 1st of 2022.
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chair and
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr cronin and mr
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
green um
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
so i've seen your i've seen your sign
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
i've seen your sign on the door in the
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
first door of the uh first floor of the
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
london home gymnasium but never actually
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
seen you till today
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
and probably because you're working so
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
hard um
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is a uh this bill is a
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
perennial i think it's been around as
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
long as i've been a member of the
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
legislature since 14 years and
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
um it seems like the uh rationale for
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
the rationale against it uh against
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
licensing agents in the past was
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
supposedly that it's unnecessary because
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
so few athletes are signing
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
pro-contracts from new hampshire um
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
and now suddenly it's been flipped the
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
other way around so now we're we're
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
cutting off a great uh because of the
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
nao and they i'll change this which is a
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
major change the ncaa rules now suddenly
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're cutting off this great growth
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity so
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
and actually get to a question here of
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
course um
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
so with the traditional function of the
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
athlete's agents um how pervasive how
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
how critical is that to a university
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
university like unh which uh
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
does have uh
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
usually does produce a few pro hockey
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
players every year but in a football
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
player every ten five or ten years but
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know the basketball program for
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
example is
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
except for an assistant coach who became
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
a head coach in the nba we've never had
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
anybody affiliated with the program make
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
it to the nba although certainly is
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
there a question there yes so how
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
um how many
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
athletes agents are you know trolling
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
around the campus of unh and other new
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based institutions looking for
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
clients and uh where would those clients
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
be be playing if they were placed in a
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
professional job so
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
i would say that while you don't see a
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous number of unh student
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
athletes playing and as you pointed out
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
for example the nba a couple in the nfl
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
certainly several in the nhl primarily
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually european for us for
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
both men's and women's basketball and
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
men's and women's hockey um where they
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
do go professionally overseas and and
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
there are agents involved in that
 
01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:45.990 align:start position:0%
there are agents involved in that
process

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and i've i've seen those
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
agents sitting in the stands at the
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
gymnasium in fact so um
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
a softball for you probably but
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we we register lobbyists
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
here so we know who's getting paid for
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
providing their services
 
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
providing their services
we

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
register real estate agents so people
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
can feel comfortable that
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
the person at least has some level of
 
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.789 align:start position:0%
the person at least has some level of
skill

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
skill
 
01:04:18.799 --> 01:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
skill
and

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
i know you uh representative ukela and
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
the application registration process
 
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
the application registration process
might

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
form some type of barrier
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
but do you think it also provides some
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
protection for the students
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
yes for certainly um
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
and honestly
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
at the risk of in any way undermining
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
argument i think there is a question
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
that we would have should agents become
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
more prevalent in this state what the
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
state can do to perhaps better enforce
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
the statute as written if we if we do
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
leave it on the books i think we have at
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
least one example of a student
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
a former student who went on to become
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
an agent paid the fee did what the state
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
asked him to do but then was
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
largely heard saw nothing from the state
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
in follow-up so to the degree that the
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
ncaa continues to open the door to these
 
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.710 align:start position:0%
ncaa continues to open the door to these
opportunities

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is a piece of law that we think
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
really could protect students and
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
student athletes and institutions of
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
higher education in the state
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
i just had one other follow-up and that
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
is is there any res there's
 
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.910 align:start position:0%
is is there any res there's
no

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions or limits on liability for
 
01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.309 align:start position:0%
restrictions or limits on liability for
agents

01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
agents
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
and that i'm aware of is
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any reason why a
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
student today could not file suit
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
against an agent if
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
if they were caused harmed by the
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
agent's activities
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't think so i'll let sean
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
comment i guess the one thing is it's
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
not specifically enumerated in statute
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
the way uh the opportunity for an
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
institution to do so is
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
right i do think that there is certainly
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for a student athlete
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
who's been harmed who potentially lost
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
eligibility because of the actions of an
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
agent to uh to pursue that um that's one
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the pieces that i think we like here
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
is that representative uk has added that
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
in specifically in this um but i
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on the law when it
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
comes to that aspect of things so i
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't know under the current law if they
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that but i think
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
they could
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you for your testimony
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
today thank you thank you
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
i don't have any other pink cards is
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who would like to
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%

that the committee may have regarding
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%

01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%

next we have
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%

and that it has a comma that is
 
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
and that it has a comma that is
misplaced

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
the comma should be removed after
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary and placed after
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
ministerial in order for the sentence to
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%

uh bob bevel i'm a resident of merrimack
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire representative bill boyd
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
also of merrimack sponsored this bill
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
for me in the hopes of bringing rsa 507b
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
bodily injury actions against government
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
units into compliance under current case
 
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
units into compliance under current case
law

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
by amending the definitions paragraph of
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
the statute we can hope to eliminate
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
further ambiguity or frustration of
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
purpose when citizens in file tort
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
actions against the appropriate state
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
actors for bodily injury
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
on the whole rsa507b has confusing
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
stipulations defined within his
 
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.229 align:start position:0%
stipulations defined within his
paragraphs

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and making heads or tales as to which
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
state actors have immunity is very
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to unravel at this time
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
some sections when read together could
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
be read as prohibiting any claim that
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're not based on municipal's use of
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles or premises
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
of course if the statute were read that
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
way it would lead to the unreasonable
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
sort of quote blanket immunity unquote
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
that was struck down by the supreme
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
court in merrell versus manchester
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
nevertheless state actors have seized
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
upon the confusing language of the
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
statute on an attempt to shield
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
themselves from liability
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
the supreme court recognizes that quote
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
leaving an injured citizen exposed
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
without resource is foreign to the
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
spirit of our constitutional guarantee
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that every subject is entitled to a
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
legal remedy for injuries he may receive
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
in his person or property unquote
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
if state actors are allowed to argue
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
that rsa 507 b5 allows them complete and
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
total immunity from negligence claims
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
then rsa 507b as read becomes
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional because it violates the
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
state constitution for remedy and equal
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
protection simply because quote the
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
defendant is a municipality unquote
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
the court has previously concluded that
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities are subject to the same
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
rules of liability as private
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
corporations so technically there should
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
be no ambiguity
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
however several supreme court decisions
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh the court has lost sight of its own
 
01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh the court has lost sight of its own
rulings

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
rulings
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
but to redeem itself in fairly versus
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
city of concord the court noted that
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
quote it has not interpreted 507b as
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
completely occupying the field of
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
municipal immunity so as to preempt the
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
common law doctrine
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in everett versus general electric
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
the court set to distinguish the
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
difference between qualified immunity
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
and official immunity
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
the everett court quotes on that quote
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
the goal of official immunity is to
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
protect public officials from the fear
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
of personal liability which might deter
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
independent action and impair effective
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
performance in their duties unquote
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
so how do we resolve the ambiguities of
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 507b without creating a
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional crisis and without
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
rewriting the entire statute
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has been signaling the
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislature in several of its rulings
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
looking for this clarification
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court has
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
consistently held that the municipal
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
immunity in rs-75507b
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
is based on planning or discretionary
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
functions and not on ministerial
 
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.510 align:start position:0%
functions and not on ministerial
functions

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
functions
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
and what is most important is the court
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
strongly points out that our
 
01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.030 align:start position:0%
strongly points out that our
rsa

01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
chapter 507b does not address
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
discretionary or ministerial function
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
immunity anywhere
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
so what is the difference between
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
discretionary decisions and ministerial
 
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.189 align:start position:0%
discretionary decisions and ministerial
one

01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
again we turn to the decision in everett
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
wherein the court states quote a
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
discretionary decision act or omission
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
involves the exercise of personal
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
deliberation and individual professional
 
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.430 align:start position:0%
deliberation and individual professional
judgment

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
that necessarily reflects the facts of
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
and the professional goal
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
an official's decision act or a mission
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
that is ministerial is when it is
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
absolute certain and imperative
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%

in the mayoral decision the court
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
recognized the distinction that
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
discretionary function immunity was
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
still afforded to those state officials
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%

again remember that rsa chapter 507b
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
does not currently address discretionary
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%

it
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
most recently an effort the court
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
clarified to whom municipal immunity was
 
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.630 align:start position:0%
clarified to whom municipal immunity was

entitled

stating that quote accordingly we hold
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
that municipal police officers are
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
immune from personal liability for

not made in a wanton or reckless manner
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's everett at 219.
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
so how do we resolve the ambiguities of
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
rsa 507b in order to simplify which
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
state actors are entitled to immunity in
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
i propose that the legislature repair
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
this confusion by simply narrowing the
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
definition of state actors defined under
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
this statute based on the court's
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
previous interpretations in the five
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
cases i've listed
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
therefore i have asked that house bill
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
103 for be approved to amend rsa
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
b1 1a to include the following phrase
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
provided he or she
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
her official duties to

and is in his
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
her decisions acts or omissions are
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary rather than
 
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.310 align:start position:0%
discretionary rather than
ministerial

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
ministerial
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
comma and three not made in a wanton or
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
reckless manner such as in the language
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%

company
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
one final point i wish to leave with you
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
and if as some state actors would have
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
you believe that rsa 507b grants all
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
state employees complete immunity from
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
liability for tort claims against them
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
then why do municipalities pave into the
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
pooled risk liability insurance when you
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
purchase a home or auto insurance you
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
expect to be able to collect on your
 
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.189 align:start position:0%
expect to be able to collect on your
damages

01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
in fact if the law said that you didn't
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
that no one could sue you you'd quit
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
paying for life insurance or for car
 
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.550 align:start position:0%
paying for life insurance or for car
insurance

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
the fact municipalities continue to
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
purchase liability insurance is their
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
tacit submission that they are indeed
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
liable for those state actors whose
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
actions or inactions are ministerial or
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
are made in a wanton or reckless manner
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%

shifting the immunity to simply

discretionary function immunity rather
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.790 align:start position:0%
sections of that chapter i should say
and

01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
we understand we understand that
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated area
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
it is something that's been subject to
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
several court opinions
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
defining exactly
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
what the immunity is that the
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislature granted but
 
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
legislature granted but
effectively

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
what this statute
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
no long it would eliminate the
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
immunity provisions in statute for
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
officials and employees doing their
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
day-to-day activities
 
01:20:36.719 --> 01:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
day-to-day activities
and

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
shift the focus entirely on to
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
the policy making portions of those
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
how the statute currently functions
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
which is to allow a broader immunity
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
um and so that would
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
that would potentially cause
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
greater liability on the part of
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and therefore we oppose
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.669 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.679 --> 01:21:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
i understood you correctly
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
and just as you summarized you ended
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
you indicated that this would create a
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
broader immunity
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry uh
 
01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.709 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry uh
the

01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill would limit the immunity
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
provided to municipal officials and
 
01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
provided to municipal officials and
employees

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
sorry if i misstated that
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
01:21:42.639 --> 01:21:47.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
you

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.030 align:start position:0%
excuse me
yeah

01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
today my name is marissa chase i'm the
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
executive director for the new hampshire
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
association for justice
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
which is a statewide trial associate
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
statewide trial lawyers association
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
our members have
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of practice areas
 
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.430 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of practice areas
and

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because this is not the
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
testimony i thought i would be giving
 
01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.750 align:start position:0%
testimony i thought i would be giving
today

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
when our members read this bill we
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
thought it codified and expanded the
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
holding in everett
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
but it seems that
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
mr the attorney who first spoke the
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
constituent of representative boyd
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
everything he said we completely agree
 
01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.470 align:start position:0%
everything he said we completely agree
with

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
we just think that this bill is very
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
confusing our reading of it was that
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
again it expanded immunity
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the municipal association
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
clearly has a different view of it i
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
think that just goes to show how
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
confusing this whole statutory framework
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
in rsa 507b is
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
i mean our members would like to see it
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
repealed completely
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that probably won't happen
 
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.229 align:start position:0%
understanding that probably won't happen
but

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
we really got hung up with the
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
difference of provided or unless
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
provided currently in the statute this
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill changed this bill um
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
would say unless would be a better a
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
better word
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
than provided as currently in the
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
statute before the changes the bill
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeks to make
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
because the underlying problem with rsa
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
507b is that as interpreted by the new
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court it does insulate
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
public employers from common law
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
liability for intentional or reckless
 
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.350 align:start position:0%
liability for intentional or reckless
actions

01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
actions
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
but if you think of a ministerial duty
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
think of a school bus driver employed by
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know the town
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
strap in a handicapped child to a car
 
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.629 align:start position:0%
strap in a handicapped child to a car
seat

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
seat
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
what if they don't do that then to avoid
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
a crash the school bus driver slams on
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
their brakes the child is severely
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
injured there's no accountability we
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe under this bill
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
as it as our reading of it is that it
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
applies to ministerial actions as well
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that's the intent at all
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
especially after hearing from the first
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
speaker but would happy to work with any
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
party on this to um
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's a confused very confusing area
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1034.
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
and we are i expected we'd have a lot
 
01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:16.470 align:start position:0%
and we are i expected we'd have a lot
more

01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
given the history of the issue
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
so our next hearing is scheduled for 11
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
o'clock when the committee will be in
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's a ministerial duty
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
and it should absolutely be covered i
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
mean they should be subject to us
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
should he personally
 
01:26:32.239 --> 01:26:33.669 align:start position:0%
should he personally
maybe

01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
i was totally confused by the time we
 
01:26:49.679 --> 02:02:46.790 align:start position:0%
i was totally confused by the time we
were

02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
want to call it an unnecessary bill but
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's not unnecessary
 
02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
it's not unnecessary
because

02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
a public employee
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
who was seriously
 
02:03:31.679 --> 02:03:33.669 align:start position:0%
who was seriously
abused

02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
abused
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
by violations of the right to know act
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
which already
 
02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.629 align:start position:0%
which already
says

02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
that a public employee has the right to
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
be notified
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
and to attend
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
and even to request open hearings and be
 
02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.470 align:start position:0%
and even to request open hearings and be
represented

02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
represented
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
at a meeting a closed meeting
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
which is affecting that person or about
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
and this individual was denied all of
 
02:04:01.119 --> 02:04:02.709 align:start position:0%
and this individual was denied all of
that

02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
and and abused in the process but we i
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
don't you don't need to go down that
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
rabbit trail
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
right the fact is that the law was was
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
violated and it was in a serious way and
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our discussion
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
i said to him so what do you want me to
 
02:04:17.210 --> 02:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
do about it
 
02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
do about it
[Laughter]

02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a done deal what do you
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
want me to do
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
and he said well
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
what can you do i said well how about if
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
we just reword
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
the sentence that's already there
 
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
to make it clearer
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
what's required
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so all i did was i took the sentence
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
in the existing law
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
and instead of saying you're supposed to
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
notify the republic the individual has
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
the right to be notified
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
i said no much such meaning shall occur
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
unless the person is notified
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's it and it's just an attempt to
 
02:04:56.639 --> 02:04:57.750 align:start position:0%
that's it and it's just an attempt to
strengthen

02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
strengthen
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
the language not to change any of the
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
requirements doesn't do that
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
it just puts it in a little stronger
 
02:05:05.599 --> 02:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
it just puts it in a little stronger
sense

02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's what that's why the bill
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative wolper
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.229 align:start position:0%
so my question
this

02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
section of 91a
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
appears to be about
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:38.709 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
yet i recall an incident where
 
02:05:41.599 --> 02:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
yet i recall an incident where
under

02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
so is this to be read to be exclusively
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
about public employees
 
02:05:57.199 --> 02:05:59.030 align:start position:0%
about public employees
so

02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
question the answer to your question is
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that i emailed you this
 
02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:07.830 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that i emailed you this
morning

02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
which adds similar
 
02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
which adds similar
language

02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
to another
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
part of the 91a
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
to cover individuals private individuals
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
so those private individuals will have
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
the same protections
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think that the the lawyers in the room
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
would probably um
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
ask about uh notifying and what sort of
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
time frame uh
 
02:06:42.719 --> 02:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
time frame uh
notice

02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
notice
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
would require do you have a concept of
 
02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.189 align:start position:0%
would require do you have a concept of
that

02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that the notification
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
period were
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat longer
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
but i recognize that
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
in at least some of these i can easily
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
envision cases
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
where the notification period would be
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily quite short
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so i didn't add a time
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
reference in it
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
mr member
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually i have not
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
seen the uh seen the amendment i was
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
probably busy waking up and driving to
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
concord when he sent it out but um
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and i guess that applies to the part the
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
other party added like what happened
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
what do we do
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
if there's good reason for not telling
 
02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.550 align:start position:0%
if there's good reason for not telling
the

02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
employee or the other person in fans
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
maybe because they're
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
threatening another person maybe they
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they might be dangerous if they
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
knew they were about to be fired or
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
disciplined or what if they're pulling
 
02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:50.470 align:start position:0%
disciplined or what if they're pulling
some

02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
well if they're putting some some some
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
scam and you need to catch them unaware
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
say if they're embezzling money or
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
whatever so
 
02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:59.669 align:start position:0%
whatever so
um

02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
this seems to leave no exception for
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
cases uh where there's a good reason for
 
02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:06.069 align:start position:0%
cases uh where there's a good reason for
not

02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
not informing the uh employees so that
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
was it was that your intent to
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate such meetings or
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
or do you feel there's a safeguard
 
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere else the law or are you or do
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
you need to amend the bill again so like
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
what's your response to that because as
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
i said there are
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
often good reasons why you want to meet
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
to talk about somebody before you let
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
him know that he's being talked about
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
just so
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
especially when you're dismissing
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
somebody which can be a very emotional
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
very dangerous
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
moment thanks
 
02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:39.669 align:start position:0%
moment thanks
so

02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh all i can say to you is
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
i changed nothing
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the existing statute
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
anything all i did was reword the
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
existing sentence so if you think that
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
there should be some additional
 
02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.709 align:start position:0%
there should be some additional
exemption

02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
right now the law is blanket it says a
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
person shall be notified
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
before you have the meeting and has
 
02:09:02.239 --> 02:09:04.790 align:start position:0%
before you have the meeting and has
rights

02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what it says after
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
my bill is adopted it says the person
 
02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
should be notified and has rights
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
the difference only difference is mine
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
says you cannot have the meeting
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
unless you've met the requirements of
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
the law
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
right which is really what the other one
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
meant too
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
um representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um representative walper
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
i thought that a few minutes ago
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
i heard in this room that
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
this would cover private
 
02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.990 align:start position:0%
this would cover private
people

02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh yes i sent you an amendment this
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
morning okay that would
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
establish the private individuals are
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
not currently
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
protected in the law in this way
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is only for public employees
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
so my amendment
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually does add the protections for
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see that i have the
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
if you have if all you're doing is
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill it won't be there
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
because it's in i'm looking at the
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment you're reading the amendment
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%

new hampshire municipal association
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
i have not seen the amendment uh that
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative wolfer uh spoke about it
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%

02:10:59.040 --> 02:10:59.910 align:start position:0%

um

02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
preliminarily i will say that we are
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
more likely than not to object to the
 
02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:05.830 align:start position:0%
more likely than not to object to the
amendment

02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
extending um
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of uh
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
process to private individuals but as i
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it i can't speak
 
02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:15.510 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it i can't speak
definitively

02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
definitively
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
um as far as the introduced bill
 
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.189 align:start position:0%
um as far as the introduced bill
i

02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
nhma is neither for it nor against it we
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
read it
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
as representative walter
 
02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:28.709 align:start position:0%
as representative walter
uh

02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
proposed it which is that it simply
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies the language um
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
and the way this functions now is that
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
if a
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
public employee
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
has a right to a meeting and
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
presumably the governing body but
 
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.510 align:start position:0%
presumably the governing body but
whatever

02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
body is meeting about them
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
to regard the dismissal promotion
 
02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:53.189 align:start position:0%
to regard the dismissal promotion
compensation

02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
disciplining or investigation of charges
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
is going to meet and that would
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
implicate the right to a meeting
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
that employee is supposed to be noticed
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
and have a right to attend and allow
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
that meeting or i guess request that the
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
meeting be an open meeting rather than a
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
non-public session occurring at the
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
meeting um so it wouldn't change the way
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
that the law functions
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
um it would just clarify some of that
 
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:20.550 align:start position:0%
um it would just clarify some of that
language

02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
any questions questions for attorney
 
02:12:24.239 --> 02:12:27.589 align:start position:0%
any questions questions for attorney
grace

02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony

my name is lori ordolano i live in

nashua i'm vice president for right to

know new hampshire
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
right to know new hampshire is
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
supporting h.b 1036 with an amendment
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
which would require citizens to be
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
notified if they wish to participate in
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
a non-public meeting when it involves
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
their reputation we are requesting that
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the law change this amendment apply to
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 91 dash a colon 3 section c
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
matters which affect the reputation of
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
others other than
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
section a which
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to section a which was
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
originally proposed i became actively
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
involved in the work done by the nashua
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
assessing office questioning the
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
practices and consistency of assessments
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
created through right-to-know requests
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
prior to attending board of assessor
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
meetings the board rarely entered
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
non-public session or produced any
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
records of such meetings in 2019
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions became a regular
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
occurrence once i started going and now
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
the board spends two-thirds of their
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
meeting time in non-public session
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
100 of the 2021 meetings of which there
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
were 20 had a non-public session using
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
exemption c
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
matters which likely would affect the
 
02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
reputation of others i believe a number
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
of these sessions involved matters that
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
could affect my reputation and involved
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
my request for information and research
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the office i have never been notified
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
by the board to request an open meeting
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
on this matter
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
boards often operate at the behest of
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
the administration and can be kept in
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
the dark on
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
certain citizen issues
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
these non-public sections lack about a
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
lack balanced perspective
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to be notified
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
when discussions regarding my reputation
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
are the topic of a non-public session
 
02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
and be given the choice for the public
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
meeting for a public meeting or
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
to participate in that public session
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i've attached amended a language to
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
section c
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
rsa 91a colon 3
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
which is matters which if discussed in
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
public would likely
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
adversely affect adversely the
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
reputation of any person other than a
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
member of the public body itself unless
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
such person requests an open meeting
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's the standing language we're
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
adding a person may request a non-public
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
session if they believe a topic will
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
affect their reputation the person to be
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
discussed by the board shall be notified
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
in writing at least 48 hours prior to
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
the non-public session provided that
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
notification may be waived upon written
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
agreement of the parties such person
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
shall be afforded the opportunity to a
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
be present at the session during
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
discussions and decisions which involve
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
the person b have counsel or a
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative of his or her own
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
choosing present and attending for the
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
purpose of advising the individual and
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
not for the purpose of active
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
participation in the session three speak
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
on his or her own behalf
 
02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
on his or her own behalf
d

02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
d
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was c
 
02:16:19.199 --> 02:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
that was c
d

02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
d
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
at the person's option record the
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
session by auto recording for or
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
transcription at the person's expense
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
um item three was added that contractors
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
of bid business can't participate in a
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
non-public session based on issues of
 
02:16:33.439 --> 02:16:35.190 align:start position:0%
non-public session based on issues of
reputation

02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
reputation
 
02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
reputation
so

02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:37.669 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
and that last item was just added
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
because we were concerned that if by
 
02:16:42.719 --> 02:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
because we were concerned that if by
chance

02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
chance
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
a municipality has bid work out
 
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
a municipality has bid work out
um

02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
that if they um
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
invited one bidder in to discuss
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
something without in a non-public
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
session and didn't do it for another it
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
would be an unfair advantage and bid
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
business is different in that it's a
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
financial matter
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
to advance
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
the municipality on a project so we
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
didn't want to see this become an issue
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
of having bidders in these non-public
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
sessions it's really more geared towards
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
citizens that are concerned
 
02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:18.629 align:start position:0%
citizens that are concerned
um

02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i mean our our non-public sessions
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
have gone up tremendously every board
 
02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
have gone up tremendously every board
meeting

02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
literally two-thirds of the meeting is
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
now non-public
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
and since 2019
 
02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
and since 2019
um

02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 there has not been a set
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
of minutes unsealed
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
when they're spending 30 40 an hour an
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
hour and a half in a non-public nothing
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
comes out of it even if contract
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
negotiations are finalized on
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
let's say property appeals
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the um representative who asked
 
02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
and the um representative who asked
about

02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know what do you do when you have
 
02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:52.950 align:start position:0%
you know what do you do when you have
somebody

02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
who might pose a risk or has been
 
02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:56.790 align:start position:0%
who might pose a risk or has been
threatening

02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
threatening
that

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
wants to be in this meeting well as the
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
law is written now an employee under
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
section i think a is allowed to be there
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
whatever risk they um
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know present um that
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
those terms really cover union employees
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
who can have a union representative come
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
in to address uh a matter in non-public
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
that affects their reputation and
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately their job as an employee but
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
if a
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
organization feels threatened or
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
concerned by an employee that has been
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
in a scuffle let's say at work and is
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
being terminated i don't see what
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
precludes them from having a police
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
officer present in the room if they fear
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
for their safety there would be a
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism there but the law right now
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
allows these individuals no matter wow
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
if they're still gainfully employed and
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
in the building to be part of that
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
hearing i suppose if they were arrested
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
and thrown in jail that wouldn't be
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
happening but
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
if they're gainfully employed
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know your personal feeling of a
 
02:18:58.559 --> 02:18:59.429 align:start position:0%
you know your personal feeling of a
threat

02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
threat
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
has to be dealt with in a different
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
manner than denying them
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
their right to be present in a meeting i
 
02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.030 align:start position:0%
their right to be present in a meeting i
think

02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%

i was not planning on testifying on this
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
bill but some of the conversation made
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
me want to clarify a couple of things
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
first nhsb is not taking a position on
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill per se i have not seen the
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
amendments um from representative walper
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
or from uh
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
ms ordolano
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
with near capacity representing
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
right to know new hampshire uh i do want
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
to cause the committee to be very
 
02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:13.910 align:start position:0%
to cause the committee to be very
cautious

02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
cautious
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
about some of the language and the right
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
to know law and what some of the
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
meanings may particularly be
 
02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
meanings may particularly be
um

02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
specifically as it relates to the
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
non-public session statute
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph a speaks to employee having a
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
right to a meeting
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
nhsba has always taken the position that
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
that language to some degree has been
 
02:20:35.359 --> 02:20:36.790 align:start position:0%
that language to some degree has been
inappropriate

02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
nobody has a right to a meeting what you
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
may have a right to is a hearing
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
which may be held in an open meeting or
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
a non-public session the right to a
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
hearing has to be based under statutory
 
02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
hearing has to be based under statutory
law

02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
the constitution per se administrative
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
rules or perhaps a school board policy
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
may grant
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
a parent or a student a hearing before a
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
particular school board
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
the other concern that nhs so that's one
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
concern with with with paragraph a which
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
talks to a right to a meeting again you
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have a right to a
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
meeting you have a right to a hearing
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the impacted person the student or
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
in a school context has the choice of
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
having that an
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
open meeting or a non-public session
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
second relative to paragraph c
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
the reputation provision again i would
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
caution this committee
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be mindful about requiring a public
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
body to invite the person that the
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
public body is going to be speaking
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
about if that person's reputation is
 
02:21:43.349 --> 02:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
going to be impacted by way of example
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in the right to know
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
law the non-public chess the non-public
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
session statute
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
that speaks specifically about a school
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
board addressing student matters under a
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
non-public session because that
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
student's reputation is being impacted
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
so student disciplinary matters are all
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
we we advise our school boards to use
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph c for all student disciplinary
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
matters whatever that discipline may be
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
it seems very peculiar that in the
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
initial stages of an investigation
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
a student is alleged to have been
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
selling drugs a student is alleged to
 
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
have been engaged in some sort of
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing on school grounds where the
 
02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing on school grounds where the
superintendent

02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
the principal need to inform the school
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
board need to perhaps have the attorney
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
there because an investigation needs to
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
be done it seems very peculiar that we
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
would invite the alleged into that
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
non-public session when the school board
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
the superintendent
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
and perhaps an attorney perhaps an
 
02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:40.230 align:start position:0%
and perhaps an attorney perhaps an
investigator

02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
need to formulate the scope of how
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to proceed with that
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
particular incident so nhsb would be
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
very very would ask this community to be
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
very very cautious about commit
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
about including anything in the
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
non-public session statute that would
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
require the impacted person whose
 
02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.429 align:start position:0%
require the impacted person whose
reputation

02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
reputation
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
who the board may be talking about to be
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
allowed into that conversation it would
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
significantly inhibit public bodies from
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
investigating taking discipline against
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps employees speaking with
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
investigators and things of that nature
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
so to the bill itself again we're not
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
taking a position on it but
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the conversation with some of
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
these amendments i i felt it prudent to
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
provide this committee information about
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
one the difference between a mirror a
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
meeting and a hearing and two some of
 
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we may not want to um
 
02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:32.710 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we may not want to um
allow

02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the impacted individual into the
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
non-public session when the public body
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
needs to sort of sort these things out
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
initially and i'll conclude my testimony
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
the only question i have is the language
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the statute that's being amended
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
specifically refers to a meeting in this
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
case so are you suggesting that
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill be used to change
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
the language which was previously
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
adopted by the legislature
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chair um
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know it it
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
possibly it's one of those things in the
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
school context we've just sort of lived
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
with it and provided legal advice in a
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
manner that
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we thought made sense within the
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
the constraints of of of the statute so
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i mean i hadn't thought about an
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendment if you would be willing to
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
entertain that i can certainly work on
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
something with our staff attorney and
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps bring nhma in into the fold as
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
we could certainly make a suggestion
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir
 
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:47.190 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much sir
any

02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else have questions
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank you very much
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
now we'll close the hearing on house
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill 1036
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the committee will be in recess
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
until our next hearing which is
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled for one o'clock
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.520 --> 02:26:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.200 --> 02:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.560 --> 02:28:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.160 --> 02:29:10.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.359 --> 02:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.120 --> 02:37:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:13.270 align:start position:0%
there's no
is

02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i can do that
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.800 --> 04:01:33.429 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
it being one o'clock we'll
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
call the house judiciary committee to
 
04:01:38.160 --> 04:01:40.150 align:start position:0%

alrighty thank you mr chairman and
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%

my name is cam kenny
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
i am the prime sponsor of this bill i
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
represent durham and madbury which of
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
course includes the university of new
 
04:02:24.560 --> 04:02:26.150 align:start position:0%

hampshire

04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to um introduce hb 1291.
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
um so first the bill is only 14 lines so
 
04:02:35.349 --> 04:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
i'll just go over it briefly
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh lines three to about half of five
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
speaks to the intention of the bill
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
which is that a prospective tenant who
 
04:02:44.790 --> 04:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
participates in the housing choice
 
04:02:46.150 --> 04:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
voucher program
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
cannot be denied
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
for the sole purpose of being a
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
participant in this program
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
this is commonly known as a section 8
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
choice voucher
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
lines seven through thirteen provide
 
04:03:00.150 --> 04:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
two reasons where denying a prospective
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
tenant would not be in violation
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
lines seven through nine carves out the
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
first instance with the rent charged
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the unit is above that which the
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
housing authority can approve so long as
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
the rent price is comparable with
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
similar units
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through 13 discuss the second
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
exception which is instances that the
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
dwelling fails to meet the housing
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
quality standards so
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
not only do we have those two instances
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
carved up where you would not be in
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
violation but nothing prohibits the
 
04:03:36.150 --> 04:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
landlord to continue their screening
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
policies that all other applicants would
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
go through
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
i mean it can take five years or more
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%

04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
with multiple personal testimonies in
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
situations of long waiting periods even
 
04:04:00.550 --> 04:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
eight to nine years
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
to make it to the top of the waiting
 
04:04:02.479 --> 04:04:03.349 align:start position:0%
to make it to the top of the waiting
list

04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
after these low-income families make it
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
to the top of the list it is typical
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they will lose the voucher because
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot find a landlord who will
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
accept it
 
04:04:14.950 --> 04:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon that listing for
 
04:04:14.960 --> 04:04:16.070 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon that listing for
rentals

04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
rentals
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
will specify that they do not accept
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
section 8 choice vouchers
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
it is more than reasonable that
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
landlords should not be permitted to
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
deny low-income families who are in
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
desperate need of housing just because
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
they hold one of these vouchers there's
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
a stigma
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
that we do need to change
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
but you will hear other testimonies
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
after me
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat what they will
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
say so i will wrap it up i am happy to
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
there are experts and like i said
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
personal testimonies who will be
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
following me if i cannot answer any of
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
those questions thank you mr chairman
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:04:58.150 --> 04:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you for your testimony today
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much rep
 
04:05:19.110 --> 04:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative gordon and thank you very
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
much i guess you're thank you very much
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair and you're
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
revenue kenny covered it uh pretty well
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
so i probably have nothing to add but
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'll add something anyway
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
anyway it's section eight first of all
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's a federal program created in the
 
04:05:36.150 --> 04:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
mid 70s um
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think it was during
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
the uh presidency of richard m nixon
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
who's not exactly known as a
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
not exactly known as a flaming liberal
 
04:05:45.199 --> 04:05:46.710 align:start position:0%
not exactly known as a flaming liberal
although

04:05:46.710 --> 04:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
although
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
and it's uh
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
the services are provided by local
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
public housing authorities which here in
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire exist only in certain
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
towns and cities but the hampshire
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority does provide
 
04:05:56.080 --> 04:05:57.429 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority does provide
statewide

04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
oversight of section 8 programs and uh
 
04:05:59.680 --> 04:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
oversight of section 8 programs and uh
does

04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
the program does serve tenants who live
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
in towns other than those view which has
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
a which have a housing authority which
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
is mostly
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
mostly the larger ones but a few smaller
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
ones which do my
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
german madbury do neither them have a
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
housing authority there's one in dover
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
but there are some subsidized housing
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
even in our community
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
as was already mentioned the choice
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
housing choice voucher premiums it's
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
very popular with the tenants in fact
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
the latest is so long in many areas you
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
can't even get on the list and
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
then once ironically once you get the
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
voucher then that you'll have a few
 
04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
months to find a place to rent and um
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
and uh these
 
04:06:41.910 --> 04:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
vouchers are intended for tenants who
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
wish to try to rent a uh i guess a
 
04:06:43.840 --> 04:06:46.590 align:start position:0%
wish to try to rent a uh i guess a
non-subsidized

04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
non-subsidized
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
non-sub subsidized development there's
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
many that were subsidized with a um
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
with the tax the tax credit or other
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
programs in fact there's some landlords
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
who do nothing but build section 8
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
eligible housing but um but that doesn't
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
apply those are separate uh vouchers for
 
04:07:01.680 --> 04:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
apply those are separate uh vouchers for
those

04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
um you're going to hear a lot of
 
04:07:08.399 --> 04:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
um you're going to hear a lot of
anecdotes

04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
anecdotes
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
about how bad the tenants are and a
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
small percentage of sectioning tenants
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
are bad but this is true of all tenants
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
subsidized as well as unsubsidized and
 
04:07:20.309 --> 04:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
actually the actual data
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
that the housing and urban development
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
farm and housing for element is made
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
made available tends to show that the
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
tenants are preferable to non-voucher
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
tenants they are more likely to pay
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
their rent on time
 
04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
partially because some of it is being
 
04:07:35.110 --> 04:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
paid on time by uh
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
the local housing authority they take
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
better care of their units and they stay
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
longer they stay on average of eight and
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
three-quarters years which is much
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
longer than most tenants stay so
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
and we're also going to hear about the
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and actually
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
it is true that section 8 tenants have
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
more guaranteed rights and more
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
enforceable rights than regular tenants
 
04:07:53.600 --> 04:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
enforceable rights than regular tenants
and

04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the housing authorities do um
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
defend those rights pretty zealously in
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
many cases and sometimes
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes hud does too but that's not a
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
bad thing the section 8 housing
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
standards are detailed but
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
the reasonable and common sensical um
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's just uh
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing on there that every
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
every tenant regardless of whether or
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
not they qualify for a voucher uh should
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
be getting as a matter of course it's
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
just um there's a mechanism a place for
 
04:08:23.600 --> 04:08:25.110 align:start position:0%
just um there's a mechanism a place for
enforcing

04:08:25.110 --> 04:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
enforcing
 
04:08:26.790 --> 04:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
those standards and those rights which
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
other tenants don't have and that's uh
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
and that's so that's uh i think this is
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
04:08:35.590 --> 04:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good bill it'll
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
actually help i think all tenants
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
the things the inspectors
 
04:08:42.630 --> 04:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
um talk about as i said as i said
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's things every tenant should have
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and probably that would probably make
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
the landlords more uh
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
more aggressive about maintaining those
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
standards in their other units too so
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know anyway so that that's that's
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
what i have to add add to it so i also
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass the bill so and also
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of these anecdotes which we may or
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
may not be hearing i think we probably
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
just trying to listen to them listen to
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully but try to figure out if
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
you figure just try to
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
figure out what's being left out because
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in previous hearings lots of times
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
they'd say these things and they thought
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
it was a sectioning tenant sometimes not
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
sure they're not sure who came to
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
inspect it and not quite sure when these
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
things happened and uh
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know just
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's just something i urge the
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee to be be sensitive to so
 
04:09:31.600 --> 04:09:33.269 align:start position:0%
committee to be be sensitive to so
um

04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is this isn't this is a this is an
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
excellent program and uh it should be
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%

04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%

04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
how does a voucher fit into that
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
category of protected classes
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
quite fit in there but the body uh has
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
other duties other than enforcing that
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
laundry list of uh protected classes and
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
this would be uh
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually have the bill and the rsa
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
referred to right in front of me this
 
04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
would add a new paragraph 1a right after
 
04:10:38.000 --> 04:10:39.269 align:start position:0%
would add a new paragraph 1a right after
so

04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
so roman numeral 1 is just an
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
introduction um
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
and actually there are some
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
there already is some stuff about
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
rentals in there anyway so this is uh
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
decided to put in a separate paragraph
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
but that's uh that's the intent of it so
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's the body that would uh
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
enforce the complaints if the
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
tenants and landlord were unable to come
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
to agreement through through other means
 
04:11:05.680 --> 04:11:06.950 align:start position:0%
to agreement through through other means
and

04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
disputes are usually going to be about
 
04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
things that happen between other
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
landlords and other tenants too and then
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
04:11:15.110 --> 04:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
as i said before the standards in there
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
are pretty commonsensical there's just
 
04:11:17.040 --> 04:11:18.870 align:start position:0%
are pretty commonsensical there's just
not

04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
just most uh tenants don't don't have
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
anyone to help them enforce them but
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
these are all like fairly standard
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
standard things that the landlord is
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
expected to do even though not all do
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo did you have a
 
04:11:34.880 --> 04:11:37.269 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo did you have a
question

04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
um would you say that there's a lot of
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation about the section 8
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
program um absolutely and i'll try to
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
help to dispel some of my handing around
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
a fact sheet that hud uh
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
prints up
 
04:11:54.000 --> 04:11:55.110 align:start position:0%
prints up
and

04:11:55.110 --> 04:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
and actually if you look at the hud
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
website they have an excellent youtube
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
video with a conversation between a
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
small landlord and a slightly bigger
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
landlord and the
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
slightly bigger landlord is telling the
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
homeowner who has like an extra unit
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
why it's a good thing to participate in
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
and of course although that's somewhat
 
04:12:14.800 --> 04:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
and of course although that's somewhat
different

04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
housing market in the fictional scenario
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
in that youtube because they sort of
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
seem that uh
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
for example that it's
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to find tenants i talk about
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
how it's easier
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
is another avenue you can reach out to
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
find potential tenants which i'm pretty
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure our landlords here in answering
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
many problems but finding potential
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
tenants is probably pretty low in their
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
list at the moment but
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%

i'm here today to speak on behalf of the

disability community and to ask your
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
support of hb 1291
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination against
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
tenants using house choice vouchers
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
as the mother of a young man who
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
experiences autism it is my greatest
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
hope that he will experience as much
 
04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
independence as possible in his
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
community as he transitions to adulthood
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
the housing choice voucher program in
 
04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a critical piece
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
to a complex system
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that people with
 
04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities can be productive members
 
04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
of their home communities
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
hb 1291 would help remove discriminatory
 
04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
most new hampshire residents will
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
experience a disability at some point
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
during their lives either personally or
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
within their families
 
04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
we must protect the vision and integrity
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
of rsa 171 a
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%

closing institutions in new hampshire
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
helping to pass hb 1291 is one way that
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
we can ensure that we continue to
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
support our new hampshire citizens that
 
04:15:03.429 --> 04:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
experience a disability
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%

the next speaker would be elliot berry
 
04:16:14.790 --> 04:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i just would note that i have a
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
commitment to testify upstairs and i'm

representative sylvia to run the rest of
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
you'd think i'd know that by now thank
 
04:17:05.920 --> 04:17:10.149 align:start position:0%
you'd think i'd know that by now thank
you

04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you it's good to be back before
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is elliott berry
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh i've been a attorney at new hampshire
 
04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
legal assistance for over 40 years where
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
i've done an enormous amount of work and
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
probably most aspects of housing law
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
i have a few handouts with um
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i just want to run through
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh the first one
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
just gives you a little background about
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
we have a housing market in which the
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
median rent is
 
04:17:42.750 --> 04:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
including utilities is 1
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
498 for a two-bedroom apartment a
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of less than one percent
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the most staggering figure of all 27
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
more than 27 000 people
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
households in new hampshire are paying
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
more than half of their income for rent
 
04:18:02.399 --> 04:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
more than half of their income for rent
so

04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
the section 8 voucher program you have
 
04:18:06.000 --> 04:18:06.790 align:start position:0%
the section 8 voucher program you have
it's

04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
geared for people of a low income
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
largely people at 50 percent of median
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
income for the state or less
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
most people
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
who get these vouchers have been waiting
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the voucher for over five years
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
many of those people are the same people
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
who are paying over half their income
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
for rent and what happens when they do
 
04:18:29.920 --> 04:18:30.790 align:start position:0%
for rent and what happens when they do
that

04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
they get they fall behind they get
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
evicted and then when they go to apply
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
for a new apartment
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the question is have you been evicted
 
04:18:41.349 --> 04:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yeah i was paying more
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
than half of my income for rent
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
so they just get into a cycle of
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
eviction and homelessness
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
so the tenant is guaranteed in the
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
program to pay or i should say in the
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of cases because
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
of this federal subsidy that comes
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
through local and state housing
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
authorities the tenant pays 30 percent
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
of their income for shelter and
 
04:19:05.680 --> 04:19:07.189 align:start position:0%
of their income for shelter and
utilities

04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
and the housing authority pays the rest
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
is a public housing authority
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
creates a something called a payment
 
04:19:18.880 --> 04:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
creates a something called a payment
standard

04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is mostly set at about 110 percent
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the fair market rent
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh and what the landlord has to do to be
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
to continue to get paid is to keep the
 
04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
property up to hud's fair uh a hud's uh
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
housing quality standards
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
the what's
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
important to know about this is that the
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
housing quality standards aren't all
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
that different than what the local house
 
04:19:44.159 --> 04:19:45.189 align:start position:0%
that different than what the local house
the

04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
city of manchester the city of nashua
 
04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
the local housing codes are very very
 
04:19:50.000 --> 04:19:51.269 align:start position:0%
the local housing codes are very very
similar

04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
similar
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
and we also have the state law about you
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
know dealing with lead but it's a good
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
deal for landlords
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
because the rent
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
is all most of the rent is guaranteed if
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
the tenant misses a payment it's usually
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
a small portion of the contract rent so
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
even if the tenant doesn't pay the
 
04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
housing authority is going to pay most
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh most of the price
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
so here's the problem
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the vouchers are generally good for 60
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
days with a right to an extension for 30
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
days and perhaps another 30-day
 
04:20:28.000 --> 04:20:29.110 align:start position:0%
days and perhaps another 30-day
extension

04:20:29.110 --> 04:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
extension
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
we have we have personally conducted a
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
survey of most of the housing
 
04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
authorities in the state including the
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing finance authority
 
04:20:39.910 --> 04:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
which runs by far the largest in the
 
04:20:39.920 --> 04:20:41.189 align:start position:0%
which runs by far the largest in the
state

04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
we found that
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
over the past year these authorities and
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a chart in the materials
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i gave you
 
04:20:50.910 --> 04:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
they issued
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
1581 vouchers over the last uh in 2021
 
04:20:56.399 --> 04:20:57.389 align:start position:0%
1581 vouchers over the last uh in 2021
and

04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
294 of them expired that means that the
 
04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
holder of the voucher couldn't find any
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
landlord who was willing to take them
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that so after waiting five years or
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
more for that voucher they're right back
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
into the cycle of not being able to
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
afford the rent and the cycle of
 
04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
eviction that invariably follows
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
let me be really clear about that
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
could you just repeat that
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
with the 1591 vouchers were issued in
 
04:21:30.309 --> 04:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
1581 right and 294 expired
 
04:21:30.319 --> 04:21:31.349 align:start position:0%
1581 right and 294 expired
um

04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
how i won't
 
04:21:35.670 --> 04:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
please understand i know and you need to
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
know that house bill 1291 will not solve
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
the problem for all about your holders
 
04:21:43.110 --> 04:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it there are
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
other serious reasons why landlords have
 
04:21:47.110 --> 04:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
good reason
 
04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
not to participate in the program
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
the biggest one is that the rents are
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
too high for what hud will approve or
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
the local housing authority will approve
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
in many cases then there are a lot of
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
tenants who have spotty records and the
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill does not say and this is just
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly important the bill doesn't
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
say you have to rent to all voucher
 
04:22:06.960 --> 04:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
say you have to rent to all voucher
holders

04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
holders
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
the bill simply says you can't refuse
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
them because they're a voucher holder
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same thing as the
 
04:22:16.239 --> 04:22:17.510 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same thing as the
current

04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that you can't you can't
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
reject a person because they're a person
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
of color or because they have
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities or because they're children
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
or because they have children sorry so
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
the if the question is or the issue is
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
the landlord can simply can apply all of
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
their usual
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
admission standards that they would
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
apply to anybody else except they can't
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
say we're not going to rent to you
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
the landlord can charge as much rent
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
with that as they want and the law is
 
04:22:55.920 --> 04:22:57.510 align:start position:0%
with that as they want and the law is
explicit

04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely explicit that if the rent is
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
higher than what the housing authority
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
will approve
 
04:23:07.349 --> 04:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
you that is not discrimination the law
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
is or the bill is explicit
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
that if the
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
housing if the unit doesn't pass hud's
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
house and quality standards
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's not discrimination
 
04:23:20.319 --> 04:23:22.389 align:start position:0%
that's not discrimination
so

04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
you might ask
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
well won't landlords still be able to
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
get around this and the answer is some
 
04:23:28.880 --> 04:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
get around this and the answer is some
will

04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about it the same way
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
that there's still disability
 
04:23:33.520 --> 04:23:35.030 align:start position:0%
that there's still disability
discrimination

04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
race discrimination
 
04:23:39.429 --> 04:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
family status discrimination that all
 
04:23:41.830 --> 04:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
exists today notwithstanding the law but
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of landlords are out
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
there that if this bill passes they'll
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
do the right thing because it's the law
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that most landlords
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
are lawless
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
so i think it
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
with very with very little downside to
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
anybody i think the bill can help all
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
those people who have waited some of
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
those people who have waited so long to
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
get that voucher
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
to finally find secure housing that they
 
04:24:15.750 --> 04:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
can afford let me just add one other a
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
couple other things
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
every state in new england has what they
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
call source of income discrimination
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
except us
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
i made when i
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
got involved with this bill i made it
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
more specific to vouchers
 
04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
people want to expand it to other
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
sources of income uh they're welcome
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
number two like
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
the the discrimination law that's in
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
effect today 354 a
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia referred to all
 
04:24:47.680 --> 04:24:49.389 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia referred to all
exempts

04:24:49.389 --> 04:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
exempts
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
owner-occupied units of three three
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
units or less so your standard triple
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
decker that landlord who lives in that
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
building is not covered as is a anybody
 
04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
who is renting out a single family home
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
if they're not renting out other single
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
family homes as well
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
finally just one thing to note that new
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
which operates the statewide program
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
section 8 program
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
over 60 percent i think it's 66 percent
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the people who are the households
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
that are assisted by this terrific
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
program are persons with disabilities so
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
obviously um
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
the program's making a big difference
 
04:25:37.110 --> 04:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and at the end of the day house bill
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
1291 will simply give people a chance uh
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
to get a foot in the door to vouch
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
holders to get a foot in the door so
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
that the landlord will evaluate them
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
based on their inherent characteristics
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
based on their their tenant record based
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
on criminal records and everything else
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
but they get a foot in the door instead
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
of having it slammed in their face and
 
04:26:00.080 --> 04:26:01.269 align:start position:0%
of having it slammed in their face and
saying

04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
no we just don't take section 8.
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's a letter in there from paul
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
stewart who runs stewart property
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
management company he manages
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
2500 units in the state of new hampshire
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
and he hasn't fully supported the bill
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's other landlords who are as well
 
04:26:19.830 --> 04:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the packet also contained some
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
letters from people who have been the
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
victims of the kind of discrimination
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%

does the housing authority screen people
before

04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%

04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
actually represented dealer enzo they
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
used to when in the early days of the
 
04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
program uh they don't anymore and they
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
decided they would leave that up to the
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
individual landlord okay
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i i
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
just missed when you said what percent
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
of users of this voucher have uh
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities i dismissed what you said
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
yeah the um it's at least 60 percent and
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is just of the housing finance
 
04:27:25.030 --> 04:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
authority new hampshire housings program
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
but it's by far the biggest in the state
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think they told me 66 but i can
 
04:27:32.309 --> 04:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
guarantee you it's at least 60 percent
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
our head the head of the household is a
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
person with disabilities and that
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't count a special allocation
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's only for people with disabilities
 
04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr barry
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
could you tell me um you said that the
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
vouchers expired at uh 60 and 90 days
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the renewal for 30 days after
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
is there any particular reason for that
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
expiration date or i think and again
 
04:28:07.830 --> 04:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's 60 and then 30 30.
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
some authorities 30 and 30 30 and 30. if
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
again that's not an entitlement that's
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
based on whether the authorities think
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
you've been trying hard enough to get in
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
another place
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
but that does tell you when you have
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
those over 260 what did i say people who
 
04:28:24.630 --> 04:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
have been expired that means a lot of
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
them have been over 120 days they still
 
04:28:29.110 --> 04:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't find anything the reason for it
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think is that
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
hud realizes that at some point somebody
 
04:28:35.670 --> 04:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
else should use the voucher right that
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
this person is just
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's just not going to happen
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
for them i think you know
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
i don't really want to speak for hud but
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's the motivation behind it
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%

04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
tenants roughly 15 of my apartments are
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
rented to
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
section 8 people
 
04:29:35.590 --> 04:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
but those people
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
became my tenants because i made the
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
choice it wasn't forced upon me i took
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
on the added burden that section 8
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
program itself does add to us as
 
04:29:46.159 --> 04:29:51.349 align:start position:0%
program itself does add to us as
landlords

04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
and there it's clearly more work for us
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a landlord dealing with people on the
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
housing choice voucher program
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
than with people who are not and it is
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
not because of the tenants it's because
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the program itself
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
renting not only do we they come in with
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
a voucher we have to confirm the voucher
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
we do have extra forms we have to
 
04:30:13.359 --> 04:30:14.550 align:start position:0%
we do have extra forms we have to
complete

04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
complete
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
we have to go for the
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
modify our leases to incorporate by
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
references the h.a.p the housing
 
04:30:20.960 --> 04:30:22.229 align:start position:0%
references the h.a.p the housing
authority

04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
contract which itself is multi-page
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
fairly complicated to read document
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
we also become subject to all the rules
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
and regulations of the housing choice
 
04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
program however the housing authority
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
that enforces it does not join the lease
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
so that if a tenant leaves early
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
we cannot go back to the housing
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
authority and say we still are entitled
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
to rent for the rest of the lease as
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
with power private tenants
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
and they say no go chase the tenant
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
we also find out that i have run into
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
the situation where i have rules all of
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
a sudden that come up by the housing
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
authorities themselves
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
the handout that i gave you
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at i put numbers in the
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
upper right hand corner number one is a
 
04:31:11.110 --> 04:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
document that came from mr flanagan the
 
04:31:13.269 --> 04:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
inspector for the new hampshire housing
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
finance authority
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
prior to his starting somewhere around
 
04:31:17.680 --> 04:31:19.429 align:start position:0%
prior to his starting somewhere around
2017

04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
2017
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
i had never had any housing authority
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
ever asked to inspect my boilers my
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
basements my circuit breakers for the
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
buildings in the basement
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
and mr flanagan took it upon himself
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
decided that he was going to inspect all
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
of it handed out the letter that i gave
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
you sent it to me with a request which i
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
didn't copy that i either be at the
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
building or in the alternative secondly
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
that i have to certify to him
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
that i have complied with it
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
his idea of my being at the building is
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
he was going to inspect anywhere between
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
two and four in the afternoon i don't
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
have the time or at that time i did not
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
have the time i was working in excess of
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
60 hours a week on the buildings to
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
stand around waiting for him to come by
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
at his leisure
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
consequently i have to write them a
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
letter every year every inspection that
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
i comply with all of the requirements
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
set forth in on exhibit one and you'll
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
see a copy of the letter
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
um that i prepared as exhibit number two
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
showing all the things i had to go
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
through yes it's a letter but it's
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
another hour of work and when you're
 
04:32:28.950 --> 04:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
working 60 hours a week it's another
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
drain on resources that i have
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why i say i want to be able
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
to choose how many i have and who i have
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
also part of section 8 is that we can
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
have the rent allocation between the
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
tenant and the housing authority change
 
04:32:50.550 --> 04:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
time during the lease process
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
not least process during the lease
 
04:32:55.110 --> 04:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
itself if you look at exhibits three a b
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
and c there are letters all regarding
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
the same tenant
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
three times in the same period within a
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
number of months this tenant went in and
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
out of employment
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
i have to give him credit with his
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
disability he did does go back to work
 
04:33:11.910 --> 04:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it's bookkeeping
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's keeping track of the do different
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
rents it's more burden on me as a
 
04:33:16.480 --> 04:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
rents it's more burden on me as a
landlord

04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
to have to do this
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
i've also had an instance where we had a
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
woman by the name of lisa and she is
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
actually still a tenant
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
we contacted her about renewing the
 
04:33:28.240 --> 04:33:29.590 align:start position:0%
we contacted her about renewing the
lease

04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
lease
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
she agreed to it we contacted a section
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
eight they pushed us hard to take a
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
slightly lower rate than the maximum we
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
agreed to it
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
we start doing all the lease work lisa
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
went out and applied to subsidize
 
04:33:43.750 --> 04:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
housing and thought she was accepted
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
gave us notice said she wasn't going to
 
04:33:48.150 --> 04:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
stay with us we constantly put the mark
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
the unit on the market
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
had a new tenant had a much higher rent
 
04:33:53.830 --> 04:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
and then lisa found out there was
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
something in her background which i
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
don't remember what it was
 
04:33:59.830 --> 04:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
that got her denied in the subsidized
 
04:33:59.840 --> 04:34:01.029 align:start position:0%
that got her denied in the subsidized
housing

04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
now she was facing homelessness
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
we were agreeing to keep her there we
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
had to work with the tenant the
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
prospective tenant who was applied and
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
we had accepted and we were lucky he
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
didn't sue us for the difference between
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
what he
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
wore it
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
and we said to section 8 we want the
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
maximum rent we're helping you out we're
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
helping the tenant out new hampshire
 
04:34:23.109 --> 04:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
housing finance said no you accepted the
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
other rent you're stuck with it they
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
refuse to do deal with us they refuse to
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
our choice was to throw lisa out and go
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
through the eviction process or accept
 
04:34:33.760 --> 04:34:34.789 align:start position:0%
through the eviction process or accept
it

04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
the time fighting was a lot lisa is a
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
nice person i didn't want to do that too
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
we accepted it but again we took a a
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
loss financially on this because this
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
particular new hampshire housing finance
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
authority person decided we couldn't do
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
it we couldn't take the regular rent the
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
there are also other instances that i
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
can go through where we've had problems
 
04:35:02.709 --> 04:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
with the housing authorities i'm not
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
complaining about the tenants i'm
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning out the housing authorities but
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh because of the request disabled in
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
i also have
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
an issue with the construction of the
 
04:35:16.000 --> 04:35:16.949 align:start position:0%
an issue with the construction of the
bill

04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:35:19.510 --> 04:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
i know that attorney barry has stated
 
04:35:19.520 --> 04:35:20.470 align:start position:0%
i know that attorney barry has stated
that

04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
it does not say we are prohibited
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
from using any other
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
screening techniques that we have used
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
however i do have a problem with it
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
and i have that problem based on an
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation of rsa 540 colon 2 the
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
eviction statute by the supreme court
 
04:35:40.709 --> 04:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
it does not say in there we are
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
prohibited from using the end of a lease
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
as grounds for an eviction however the
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
supreme court has clearly ruled that if
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
a lease is ending you cannot use it as a
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
grounds for eviction there is a case
 
04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
directly on point on this
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore because the legislature
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
did not say you can do it we are
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
prohibiting it because this bill does
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
not specifically state that we can use
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
all other
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
screening techniques i am concerned that
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
we may have a ruling from the supreme
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
court and if that comes down we have no
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
way to screen these people for
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
a child molester going into a building
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
with minor children bad rent payments
 
04:36:21.990 --> 04:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
bad behavior and please understand not
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
only does screening help us as landlords
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
screening is very important to the other
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
tenants because i've had
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
made a mistake brought in a tenant who
 
04:36:30.240 --> 04:36:31.029 align:start position:0%
made a mistake brought in a tenant who
was

04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
totally disturbed everyone in the
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
building and even called the police on
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
four of the five other tenants in the
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
building and called the police on me
 
04:36:37.840 --> 04:36:38.709 align:start position:0%
building and called the police on me
twice

04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
twice
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
and every time the police
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
they i don't know why they didn't
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
serve her for filing false complaints
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
because nothing ever came of all of them
 
04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
but she was just very very difficult to
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
i also want to point out the two
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
categories that you're in there if you
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
do not want section 8 tenants one of the
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
ways is higher rents
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
that means you are now incentivizing 10
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
landlords to raise rents which hurts not
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
only the section 8s because they can't
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
get but everybody else who's in the
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
moderate income brand looking for
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
workforce housing because all the rents
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
are being pushed up even more the other
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
alternatives allow the building to
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
deteriorate for the less scrupulous
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
landlords i will not do that i
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
don't feel that's appropriate and make
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
sure you flunk every single housing
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
housing inspection
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
the solution is really not forcing us to
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
take section eight the solution is
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
building more subsidized housing and
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's where this legislation needs to
 
04:37:35.279 --> 04:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
that's where this legislation needs to
go

04:37:36.390 --> 04:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i also want to point out that that
 
04:37:39.510 --> 04:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
we talk about the length of the waiting
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
list to get the voucher that has nothing
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill that is because
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money available for
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
vouchers that's a federal government
 
04:37:46.240 --> 04:37:47.189 align:start position:0%
vouchers that's a federal government
issue

04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
so that cannot be placed on us as
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
landlords because we have nothing to do
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
with how that is funded
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
and for those vouchers that were granted
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
the 1580 that elliott uh referred to
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
20 percent roughly little less than 20
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
percent my quick calculation of those
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
that did not get apartments how many of
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
those people was their fault because
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
they didn't put in the effort to get the
 
04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
apartments we don't know we will never
 
04:38:15.750 --> 04:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
know but it isn't as bad of a problem as
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
making it sound the worst part of the
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
problem is lack of funding for more
 
04:38:19.199 --> 04:38:21.429 align:start position:0%
problem is lack of funding for more
vouchers

04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it if you would vote this
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
thing to be it expedient to legislate i
 
04:38:26.789 --> 04:38:26.799 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a good bill i think it
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
needs more work i think it should be
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
clarified and i actually don't feel that
 
04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
it's fair to us that we're being forced
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
to take tenants when we don't want to
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr klein for your
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
klein for taking my question mr klein
 
04:38:51.510 --> 04:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
when you passed out your handouts you
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
had your exhibit one
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
was a notice from uh
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
inspector flynn again
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i i have two questions the first is
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
do does your local housing does your
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
local city
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
require specific ordinances
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh housing having to meet
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
specific standards
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
as far as i know opportunities do and as
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
as attorney barry said mrs klein could
 
04:39:17.910 --> 04:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
you speak to the microphone my apologies
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
they all
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
most of the cities and towns do when
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
there is a state statute does have those
 
04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
requirements yes but no other
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
section 8 inspector has ever asked for
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
it and i've dealt with four housing
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
authorities rochester dover somersworth
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire housing and new
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing is the only one that
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
has come up with this it's a rule that
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
he himself
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
came up with not something that i've
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
seen statewide
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
so it's is it your testimony that these
 
04:39:45.360 --> 04:39:46.150 align:start position:0%
so it's is it your testimony that these
are

04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
separate from what the house the other
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
housing authorities request its specific
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
information yes i have never had that
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
request from any other housing authority
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
as i'm reviewing these i i guess my
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
question is that these from my
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
perception these appear to be basic
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
safety standards that one might expect
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of being a property owner is
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
that accurate or
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
i agree with you there and we comply
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
with all of them
 
04:40:16.798 --> 04:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
with all of them
fully

04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
fully
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
and in fact when map boiler was replaced
 
04:40:22.708 --> 04:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
we had the city of rochester in twice
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
inspecting the boiler during the
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
construction process to make sure we
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
complied with all codes
 
04:40:30.310 --> 04:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i intend to comply with all codes my
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue is not so much that he's asking
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
for my issue is that he comes up with
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
his own rules out of nowhere
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's fair to us that
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're getting different things from
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
different housing authorities
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
and different rules that the employees
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
make not even within i don't know if
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is even in hud i didn't have the
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
time to research it
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
you for the question for the questions
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
for mr klein

04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%

04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
we are in support of house bill 1291 the
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
housing choice voucher program is a
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
really important tool in our work to
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
prevent homelessness and homelessness
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
and address our housing crisis in the
 
04:41:40.320 --> 04:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
and address our housing crisis in the
state

04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:41:41.440 --> 04:41:43.670 align:start position:0%
state
when

04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
the the data that you received regarding
 
04:41:49.510 --> 04:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
the usage rates of vouchers should be
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
a warning to all of us concerned about
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
housing stability in the state
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
we call it a success rate how many
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
voucher holders are
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
successful in using their voucher in the
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
private market
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
that success rate used to be in the 90s
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
not that long ago i would say five six
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
now we're hovering around sixty percent
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
of success for a voucher holder
 
04:42:19.750 --> 04:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
to access a unit on the private market
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
as we've as you've heard again and again
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
below one percent vacancy rate there's
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
just not any market incentive for
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
landlords to take part in the program
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
the only way to really ensure that those
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
who need a voucher are able to use it in
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
the market is to pass a law like this
 
04:42:37.280 --> 04:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
the market is to pass a law like this
so

04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
as you know we our our members are those
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
who develop manage affordable housing
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
as well as public housing authorities
 
04:42:45.440 --> 04:42:46.550 align:start position:0%
as well as public housing authorities
and

04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
supportive housing agencies and homeless
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
service agencies they are
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
what the market
 
04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
can't sustain on its own this is a very
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
important tool to them
 
04:42:59.760 --> 04:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
important tool to them
and

04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
and the passage of
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1291 would be really an
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
important step forward to make this tool
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
viable again
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you happy to
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
take care of you
 
04:43:11.600 --> 04:43:14.550 align:start position:0%
take care of you
questions

04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:43:19.750 --> 04:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
next up will be uh nick norman uh asking
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
for six to ten minutes i am sure that we
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
got uh a good background from uh mr
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
klein and uh if you could
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
consolidate see what i can do to keep it
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
brief thank you very much my name is
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
nick norman i am the apartment
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
associated in new hampshire government
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
affairs chair i lead the landlord
 
04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
initiative on landlord-tenant law
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
you all know me quite well
 
04:43:43.680 --> 04:43:45.350 align:start position:0%
you all know me quite well
um

04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
so in a bill that's this large and has
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
so many extreme
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh bad consequences to both the real
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
estate market and to property owners
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's no way that i can
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
talk about all the bad points that are
 
04:43:59.600 --> 04:44:00.390 align:start position:0%
talk about all the bad points that are
here

04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
but i did send out
 
04:44:02.240 --> 04:44:03.190 align:start position:0%
but i did send out
a

04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:44:03.200 --> 04:44:04.310 align:start position:0%
a
email

04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
email
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit ago late this morning so
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's in your inbox if you haven't
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
picked it up already
 
04:44:11.670 --> 04:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
testimony here that i could pass around
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
so i'll cover as much as i can cover and
 
04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't have time to do the
 
04:44:24.638 --> 04:44:25.830 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't have time to do the
rest

04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
rest
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
so the section 8 program was always and
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
still is designed by the federal
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
government to be a voluntary program
 
04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
it needs to stay that way
 
04:44:36.560 --> 04:44:38.230 align:start position:0%
it needs to stay that way
the

04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
using the program
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
costs extra money time and effort from a
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
property owner you've heard some of that
 
04:44:45.120 --> 04:44:45.910 align:start position:0%
property owner you've heard some of that
from

04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
those costs are real
 
04:44:53.430 --> 04:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't know that there's
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
something called the rrp rule
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
the re repair renovate paint rule which
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
has to do with lead paint that rule has
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
two sides the epa side the hud side
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
when you have a section 8 tenant you're
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
forced into the hud side of the rule
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
the hud side of the rule has much more
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions costs and
 
04:45:15.440 --> 04:45:17.030 align:start position:0%
restrictions costs and
requirements

04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
than does the epa side
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
so immediately as soon as you have a
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
property built before 1978 which is
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
largely going to be the places that
 
04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
you'll probably find
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know lower income lower rents
 
04:45:31.760 --> 04:45:33.190 align:start position:0%
you know lower income lower rents
then

04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's more expensive
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
just for that reason alone
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're very concerned as david klein said
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the bill does not make it clear
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
that you can use normal screening
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
methods to screen your tenants
 
04:45:50.310 --> 04:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to make a landlord
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
hesitant to do the normal screening that
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
he would because it's not called out
 
04:45:54.638 --> 04:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
he would because it's not called out
that

04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
then not be held subject to a
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
the section 8 program comes with many
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
components contracts
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
lots of legalese
 
04:46:11.040 --> 04:46:12.788 align:start position:0%
lots of legalese
inspections

04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:46:12.798 --> 04:46:14.150 align:start position:0%
inspections
delays

04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
delays
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
another cost is the program
 
04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
will typically always have some delay in
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
getting a tenant placed versus just the
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
open market on the open normal market i
 
04:46:27.990 --> 04:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
can place a tenant within a day or two
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
in an apartment
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
with section 8 is probably going to be a
 
04:46:33.990 --> 04:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
week or two at best because of all the
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
inspections and extra paperwork and
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
contracts and things that have to be
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
gone through so that's an extra expense
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you're forcing that on property
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
owners that's just another thing that's
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
going to happen that's going to have to
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
increase rents and worsen our housing
 
04:46:47.840 --> 04:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
increase rents and worsen our housing
affordability

04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
the thing we need to do
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't it make sense the thing we need
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
to do is to fix the program and provide
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
incentive incentives
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
so that property owners will want to use
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
the program the program used to be
 
04:47:03.520 --> 04:47:04.390 align:start position:0%
the program the program used to be
better

04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:47:06.628 --> 04:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
decades ago than it is now
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
it used to be that you could
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
go into a section 8
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
tenancy and the housing authority would
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
guarantee you two months rent as a
 
04:47:15.200 --> 04:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
guarantee you two months rent as a
security

04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
that was taken away
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
now the tenant has to pay the security
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
deposit and it's only one month's rent
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
there was a study that hud put out on
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
landlords experiences with the
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
choice voucher program
 
04:47:36.310 --> 04:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
one of the key takeaways is that
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
property owners are largely frustrated
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
with the bureau
 
04:47:39.360 --> 04:47:40.628 align:start position:0%
with the bureau
bureaucratic

04:47:40.628 --> 04:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic
 
04:47:42.868 --> 04:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies and burdens of the
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
housing authority
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
landsale landlords also had more
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
negative experience with the voucher
 
04:47:48.240 --> 04:47:50.708 align:start position:0%
negative experience with the voucher
holders

04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
holders
 
04:47:50.718 --> 04:47:51.990 align:start position:0%
holders
so

04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's very clear if if you're a landlord
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
it is very undesirable to have
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
the program it's not the tenants
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's not the source of income to say
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
that you're protecting against a source
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
of income that's ridiculous what does a
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
landlord care
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
where the money comes from
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
the problem is the program itself the
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
government bureaucracy the forcing of a
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
landlord into a government contract they
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
have no absolutely no say over
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the talking points that i've emailed
 
04:48:27.990 --> 04:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
to you and in this one that was printed
 
04:48:29.910 --> 04:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
out there's
 
04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
two attachments i would encourage you to
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
look at those
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
one of them actually here you can pass
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
this around
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's one
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
page as a visual
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.868 --> 04:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
signing up a new tenant
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
on the regular open market
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't have big printers in ink
 
04:48:53.520 --> 04:48:54.550 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't have big printers in ink
this

04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
probably at least three times as
 
04:49:00.718 --> 04:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
probably at least three times as
complicated

04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
time consuming
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's the handout that's being given to
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
you now
 
04:49:08.878 --> 04:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
you now
the

04:49:10.230 --> 04:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
housing program has what's called the
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
a lease
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
hap contract the housing authority
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
program contract
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that's 12 or 13 pages of legalese
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
that has all kinds of objectionable
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
clauses that you are forced to sign into
 
04:49:29.360 --> 04:49:31.590 align:start position:0%
clauses that you are forced to sign into
that

04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
just restrict your property and you have
 
04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
no say over
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
some of them say things like
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
the hud the
 
04:49:39.600 --> 04:49:41.190 align:start position:0%
the hud the
authority

04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
will decide for their own sales if
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to sell the property to
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
your children
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
or family relatives
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
the the handout that i'm giving you is
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
in your email it just goes through point
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
by point this is incredible
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
i mean point after point page after pays
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
of a very objectionable contract details
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
i i guess i first
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
for time i won't go into all of them but
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
very objectionable
 
04:50:09.920 --> 04:50:12.550 align:start position:0%
very objectionable
so

04:50:12.550 --> 04:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm at a loss when we come
 
04:50:16.470 --> 04:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
to bills like this because there's so
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
much to say
 
04:50:20.550 --> 04:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
this negative about it
 
04:50:22.390 --> 04:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
i could go on for hours and i know we
 
04:50:23.830 --> 04:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to say
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'll stop there and
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
summarize that i please
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
would like you to read through
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
all the talking points that are there
 
04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's a program that's
 
04:50:40.230 --> 04:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
very objectionable
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
to landlords
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's not the source of the income it's
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
the strings that come with the program
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
and to have a law that forces a private
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
citizen into compliance with a
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
government contract that they have no
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
say over and dramatically affects their
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
income and business
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
i think should be unconstitutional and
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
illegal i don't know if it is but it
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
certainly should be
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you would vote in
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on this
 
04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i haven't covered as much as i
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
need to
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i would be very willing to take
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
questions because there's a lot of mis
 
04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
understanding about section 8.
 
04:51:23.190 --> 04:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr noman i appreciate you
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
keeping your comments
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
as tight as possible questions for mr
 
04:51:27.520 --> 04:51:30.310 align:start position:0%
as tight as possible questions for mr
norman

04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:41.910 --> 04:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
when you were giving your remarks you
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
made a comment about lead paid paint
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
abatement yes and how it was so much
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
more complex in terms of hot housing
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
do you know if there continues to be a
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
subsidy from hud
 
04:51:56.310 --> 04:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
to help owners of property so that
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're able to facilitate that
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
abatement i am very aware of that and so
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
does it continue to exist
 
04:52:03.680 --> 04:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
does it continue to exist
uh

04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:52:05.520 --> 04:52:06.868 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
sort of but that's
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
it's not the full picture
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
to start off with what i was saying is
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
not related to abatement
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is when you're doing
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
a renovation
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's not an abatement
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to do that using rrp
 
04:52:25.360 --> 04:52:26.868 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to do that using rrp
rules

04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
there's two sides to that rule with the
 
04:52:30.550 --> 04:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
section 8 tenant you're forced into the
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
hud side of the rule which has more
 
04:52:32.638 --> 04:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
hud side of the rule which has more
regulation

04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not about abatement at all
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
04:52:39.120 --> 04:52:39.990 align:start position:0%
and there is
no

04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:52:40.000 --> 04:52:41.270 align:start position:0%
no
money

04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
state or federal that i'm aware of that
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
will incentivize and provide owners
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
with the ability to do renovation
 
04:52:54.070 --> 04:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
before a child is poisoned
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
abatement monies are after a child is
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
poisoned and now you're ordered to have
 
04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
an abatement
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
and there are programs to assist with
 
04:53:04.550 --> 04:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
that and they're very cumbersome and
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
many landlords have chosen not to even
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
use the
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
free money because it costs so much
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
to use it
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
claire and those programs do exist okay
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
 
04:53:21.200 --> 04:53:22.390 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
um

04:53:22.390 --> 04:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
again going back to the hud regulations
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the and the housing choice voucher
 
04:53:26.160 --> 04:53:27.430 align:start position:0%
and the and the housing choice voucher
regulations

04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:53:29.350 --> 04:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
and talking about the complexity of
 
04:53:32.470 --> 04:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
those regulations have you or your
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
organization made any effort to work
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire housing and finance
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of making some modifications to
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
those rules so that they're less
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for your industry
 
04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
and what of the results of those
 
04:53:49.270 --> 04:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
negotiations been if they've occurred
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question that's
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
where we need to be focusing our
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
attention is to fixing the program
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
there is a very large effort
 
04:54:00.550 --> 04:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the national apartment association
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
talking directly with hud
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
hud doing studies
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
of the landlord community
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
and conversations that um
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
are ongoing
 
04:54:11.680 --> 04:54:13.430 align:start position:0%
are ongoing
about

04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
things that hud can or ought to be doing
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
to incentivize property owners to comply
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
concerted and prioritized as in a real
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
high priority of the national apartment
 
04:54:31.280 --> 04:54:32.788 align:start position:0%
high priority of the national apartment
association

04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and what they found is
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
one thing for instance is the um that's
 
04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
come from that is in new hampshire and i
 
04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
think across the country
 
04:54:45.670 --> 04:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
in many cases the housing authority is
 
04:54:48.788 --> 04:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
providing a 1 000 payment to a property
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
owner as an incentive to take the
 
04:54:50.638 --> 04:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
owner as an incentive to take the
program

04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
you might note that the program is so
 
04:54:58.550 --> 04:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
onerous to the property owners they
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
still don't want to be involved
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
further questions for
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
towards the end of your testimony you
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
land lords were being forced would be
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
forced by this bill to take these
 
04:55:17.120 --> 04:55:18.550 align:start position:0%
forced by this bill to take these
tenants

04:55:18.550 --> 04:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
04:55:20.708 --> 04:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm i when i read the bill i don't
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
read it that way so i'm wondering if you
 
04:55:22.638 --> 04:55:23.750 align:start position:0%
read it that way so i'm wondering if you
can

04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
flesh that out
 
04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
for me so when you have someone coming
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
to you to apply one of the things that a
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
landlord is always concerned about is am
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
i opening myself up to discrimination
 
04:55:35.600 --> 04:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
i opening myself up to discrimination
lawsuit

04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
just the accusation of a discrimination
 
04:55:42.868 --> 04:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
lawsuit will probably cost you
 
04:55:45.270 --> 04:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
minimum five thousand dollars even if
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
there was no discrimination at all
 
04:55:48.958 --> 04:55:50.230 align:start position:0%
there was no discrimination at all
so

04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's one thing
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
another is let's suppose you have a
 
04:55:54.480 --> 04:55:55.590 align:start position:0%
another is let's suppose you have a
tenant

04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's already in your apartment they've
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
been there for five years
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
and now they've got themselves to the
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
top of the section eight list they're
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
now approved
 
04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
now you're forced absolutely forced to
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
take that tenant onto section eight
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
because you've already got them in your
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
apartment they're already approved for
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
your apartment
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
and the way that the bill is written
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:24.550 --> 04:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
exempt the normal criteria that
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
landlords use for screening so there's
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to be hesitancy on the
 
04:56:29.280 --> 04:56:31.190 align:start position:0%
going to be hesitancy on the
landlord

04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
04:56:32.948 --> 04:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
for denying people
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.600 --> 04:56:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
any further questions thank you for the
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%

04:56:44.000 --> 04:56:45.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr norman

next we have ellen
 
04:56:52.958 --> 04:56:55.430 align:start position:0%
next we have ellen
grow

04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
and you've got two minutes and uh
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate you keeping
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
close to that if not tighter thank you
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
hi my name is ellen grow i'm the
 
04:57:08.550 --> 04:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
executive director of the concord
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
coalition to end homelessness
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
we um
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
we provide some crisis services for
 
04:57:15.990 --> 04:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
people who are homeless including a
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
daytime resource center an emergency
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
winter shelter and outreach program but
 
04:57:22.788 --> 04:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
what we are really focused on is
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
permanent housing permanent supportive
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
housing for people leaving homelessness
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking in favor of this bill
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
the housing choice vouchers are one of
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
the subsidies that our clients rely on
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to afford the rent most of
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
the people we serve are
 
04:57:42.310 --> 04:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
struggling to exist on
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
disability income around 800 a month so
 
04:57:47.430 --> 04:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
even an apartment that's deemed
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
affordable they're not able to afford
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that without a rental subsidy
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about how long these
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
wait lists are and they are but this
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
past summer there was a a wave of rent
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
of section 8 if you will through the
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan that was geared
 
04:58:06.070 --> 04:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
specifically for people who are homeless
 
04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
120 vouchers were issued and our clients
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
we were fortunate that 11 of our clients
 
04:58:13.910 --> 04:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
we usually don't have any clients who
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a portable housing voucher in their
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
hands we had 11 people get vouchers and
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
to date only five of them have been able
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
to find a place to use that voucher two
 
04:58:27.030 --> 04:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
of those were because our agency bought
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
a triplex that had two vacant units so
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
we were able to put two people in right
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
away but the rest are still homeless
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to find a place
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
and we did offer an incentive as well
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
along with that and even that was not
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
enough to convince landlords to use this
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
program so i would not say that's a mark
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
of how onerous it is i think there are
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
landlords who
 
04:58:55.590 --> 04:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh simply just say no the minute they
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
hear the word section 8 and maybe they
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
are just ignorant of the program or
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they have stereotypes of the
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
people who use the program but i think
 
04:59:06.550 --> 04:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
this law would open the door to more
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
housing and to ending homelessness
 
04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is the housing choice voucher is
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
one of the most important tools that we
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
have for ending homelessness but it is
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
worthless if people can't find a place
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
to use it
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i had written testimony
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
but i realized i only copied one side of
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
it can i email that in later email will
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
be fine all right would you like the
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
my role at
 
05:00:09.270 --> 05:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
concord coalition to end homelessness is
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
an independent advocate
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
for clients
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing homelessness as
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
well as other
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
various disabilities
 
05:00:20.788 --> 05:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
i have had
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
years um in working with the homeless
 
05:00:27.910 --> 05:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
population now about the past five years
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
i've worked in this area
 
05:00:30.400 --> 05:00:31.110 align:start position:0%
i've worked in this area
so

05:00:31.110 --> 05:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
in my time i've been able to develop
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
some relationships with landlords
 
05:00:36.240 --> 05:00:37.190 align:start position:0%
some relationships with landlords
um

05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the past 30 months i mean 30 days
 
05:00:44.948 --> 05:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
i have reached out to approximately 61
 
05:00:44.958 --> 05:00:46.788 align:start position:0%
i have reached out to approximately 61
landlords

05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
in concord area alone
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
and of those 61 landlords
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
21 of them
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
so about 35
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
of my total right now
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
have said
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
a hard no absolutely positively will not
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
work with anybody using any subsidy
 
05:01:08.638 --> 05:01:10.150 align:start position:0%
work with anybody using any subsidy
whatsoever

05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
i've also had the opportunity to discuss
 
05:01:14.550 --> 05:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
the landlord incentive program
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
that ellen mentioned
 
05:01:18.240 --> 05:01:19.190 align:start position:0%
that ellen mentioned
and

05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
just an additional
 
05:01:22.240 --> 05:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
just an additional
program

05:01:23.670 --> 05:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
um and even with mention of that with
 
05:01:29.030 --> 05:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
that extra support
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
it did not sway
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh any of these these landlords
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:01:38.470 --> 05:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would be
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful to our population
 
05:01:44.550 --> 05:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not going to
 
05:01:44.560 --> 05:01:45.590 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not going to
affect

05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
affect
 
05:01:45.600 --> 05:01:47.590 align:start position:0%
affect
our

05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
total numbers of homeless individuals uh
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
that much
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
but it will make a dent
 
05:01:53.680 --> 05:01:54.788 align:start position:0%
but it will make a dent
um

05:01:54.788 --> 05:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
and ultimately that's
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
i mean progress not perfection right so
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
we just want to make some progress with
 
05:02:02.400 --> 05:02:03.590 align:start position:0%
we just want to make some progress with
this

05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:02:06.550 --> 05:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
issue that is affecting every single one
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
of us
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
because in the last five years our
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
numbers of homeless people on the
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:16.638 --> 05:02:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:17.520 --> 05:02:18.628 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
i am i'm hopeful that
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
we can support this bill um and work
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
towards making the adequate adjustments
 
05:02:27.360 --> 05:02:28.230 align:start position:0%
towards making the adequate adjustments
to

05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
the section 8 program as well moving
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
forward because
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
i i agree that the program is not ideal
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i know it's not perfect for the
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
landlords who are
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
dealing with it as it's not perfect for
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are being awarded it
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
but it is better than nothing
 
05:02:47.200 --> 05:02:49.110 align:start position:0%
but it is better than nothing
so

05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
for ms lazzotte
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh for those coming it in for the two
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
o'clock hearing we are about a half hour
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
behind so bear with us we've got uh
 
05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
three more speakers on this bill
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
the next being stephen
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you could be brief we
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it i understand we've
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
got a good picture of what's going on
 
05:03:22.868 --> 05:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
here well
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
i am
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that you know
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
that not only am i an endangered species
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
because i'm a new hampshire native
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
i am a builder
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
and a
 
05:03:35.360 --> 05:03:36.948 align:start position:0%
and a
landlord

05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
05:03:39.670 --> 05:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
and i support the bill
 
05:03:39.680 --> 05:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
and i support the bill
when

05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
i have been involved
 
05:03:43.040 --> 05:03:45.110 align:start position:0%
i have been involved
in

05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing management because
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
i build my own building so maybe that
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
makes life easier for me because i'm
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
building the building so they're always
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
to code
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
they always meet the inspections i
 
05:03:56.550 --> 05:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
haven't had the problems these other
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
people have had
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
my working relationship with new
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority is
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
fairly good
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
but yes bureaucracy is bureaucracy
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
um but i think maybe my
 
05:04:11.430 --> 05:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
visions of this is i
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
grew up poor i lived in a house no
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
central heat and no central plumbing so
 
05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
i was one of those kind of people
 
05:04:18.638 --> 05:04:19.670 align:start position:0%
i was one of those kind of people
and

05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
i have not experienced problems with
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
tenants that have section 8 vouchers i
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
actually built one of the last section 8
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
project-based projects in hampstead new
 
05:04:31.600 --> 05:04:32.708 align:start position:0%
project-based projects in hampstead new
hampshire

05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
but again
 
05:04:36.550 --> 05:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
05:04:36.560 --> 05:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
it's important
that

05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
the misconceptions that are out there
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
when i go to try to build a new project
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think people think that i don't do
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
credit checks that i don't do background
 
05:04:51.910 --> 05:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
police checks there's nothing when i
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
look at this bill and i asked mr barry
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
about it and maybe we could sharpen the
 
05:04:59.670 --> 05:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
language a little i don't believe that
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
this eliminates any of things that i
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
have to deny people
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
i've been working with section 8 since
 
05:05:07.360 --> 05:05:08.948 align:start position:0%
i've been working with section 8 since
1980

05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
1980
 
05:05:10.750 --> 05:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
how many years is that
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
44 years
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i have never been sued or
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
accosted for discrimination but i'm also
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
very careful in that
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
i just want
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know to know that
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
i've been a builder
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
i've been a
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
a tenant and i do property management
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that we we do have a serious
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
crisis on on housing i do agree with a
 
05:05:41.830 --> 05:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff there really needs to be
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
some more support it would be much
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
easier for my fellow
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
landlords to get some
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
support when they have a problem with a
 
05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
tenant and they don't right now
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
but in general my experience has not
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
been a negative with this program and
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
you need to know that
 
05:06:03.510 --> 05:06:03.520 align:start position:0%

is i'm an artist right i paint big
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%

yikes we'll say yikes is the word
 
05:08:27.280 --> 05:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
yikes we'll say yikes is the word

um
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it actually came from brain damage
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
from ms i'm a savant artist out of
 
05:08:32.000 --> 05:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
from ms i'm a savant artist out of
nowhere

05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i go around the community and i
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
paint live for people
 
05:08:39.030 --> 05:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i do the whole bob ross thing and
 
05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's therapeutic for them and me
 
05:08:41.440 --> 05:08:42.868 align:start position:0%
it's therapeutic for them and me
um

05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
i work with other homeless people to try
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
to help them i go back with pots of soup
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
literally like
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
it is so difficult out there
 
05:08:52.480 --> 05:08:54.230 align:start position:0%
it is so difficult out there
and

05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
i don't even have a chance
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i i'm not i am not a face or a person
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these applications
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
because the second they hear section 8
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
or a voucher or anything i become
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
something else
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
and that's it and there's no chance for
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
me to be who i am here's what i wanted
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
to say right so i'm an artist i have
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
this big sunset painting and i
 
05:09:18.868 --> 05:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
can't mix this color that i need to
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
finish it i've been working on it for
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
two years
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i can't mix this color and i'm not a
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
trained artist right so this is a
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
difficult thing i have
 
05:09:28.868 --> 05:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
but you know what i don't do i don't
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
complain about that to people because
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
that's my job my job today is to finish
 
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
that painting
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
so when i hear things about paperwork
 
05:09:36.878 --> 05:09:38.070 align:start position:0%
so when i hear things about paperwork
and

05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know inspections and things like
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
that i feel like if this is the business
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
you chose
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
then that's part of your job you guys
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
are all sitting here with pens and
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
papers in hand i see you taking notes
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
looks i bet you have a lot of paperwork
 
05:09:51.670 --> 05:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
in your life
 
05:09:54.550 --> 05:09:54.560 align:start position:0%

i could barely fill out the sign in card
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean but i didn't choose
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
anything that had that today because
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's not something i want to deal with
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
if that's your occupation
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
so be it
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
how is that my fault
 
05:10:11.910 --> 05:10:11.920 align:start position:0%

05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
um one was the mention um that
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
rents change in the middle of a lease
 
05:11:22.878 --> 05:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
rents change in the middle of a lease
term

05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
term
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and i think there are letters
 
05:11:29.910 --> 05:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:32.070 --> 05:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
were used to support that point but i
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make clear that the
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
contract rent for a section 8 voucher
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
holder does not change during a lease
 
05:11:38.320 --> 05:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
holder does not change during a lease
term

05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
term
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
the housing authority
 
05:11:42.550 --> 05:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
does not unilaterally
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
change the amount of contract rent that
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that is owed to the landlord a
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
tenant's income may change during the
 
05:11:51.430 --> 05:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
duration of the lease and because under
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the program
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
they by and large pay 30
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
of their income on rent if their income
 
05:11:56.878 --> 05:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
of their income on rent if their income
changes

05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
the housing assistance payment may
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease based on that
 
05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
change in income of the tenant so it is
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
that that is changing the the portion of
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the payment that is covered by the
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
tenant the portion of the payment that
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
is covered by the housing authority but
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
the overall contract rent paid to the
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
landlord does not change during the
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
lease term
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
let's see oh another point
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
entering into a
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
contract with a voucher holder would
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of landlords to evict
 
05:12:29.840 --> 05:12:30.550 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of landlords to evict
for

05:12:30.550 --> 05:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
things such as police calls to the unit
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
or certain behaviors that would
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise violate lease terms
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
that that is not true
 
05:12:38.400 --> 05:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
that that is not true
under

05:12:39.430 --> 05:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
rsa 540 landlords can evict for cause
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
that includes things like violation
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
material violations of lease terms
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
threats to health and safety of
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
landlord staff or other residents so
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to evict for cause is no
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
different for a voucher holder tenant
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
oh finally i would just like to say that
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
there is um the bill explicitly says
 
05:13:07.280 --> 05:13:09.350 align:start position:0%
there is um the bill explicitly says
that

05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:13:11.430 --> 05:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
it would be it's prohibited to refuse to
 
05:13:13.430 --> 05:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
rent to someone on the basis that they
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
are participant in the housing choice
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
voucher program that is the limiting
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
language on the basis of or because of
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
um and so it is similar to the other
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
provisions in rsa 354a that prohibit
 
05:13:27.430 --> 05:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on other protected
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
classes it does not prohibit a landlord
 
05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
from applying normal screening
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
procedures it merely prohibits the
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
exclusive denial
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
denial based exclusively on the person
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
having a voucher a housing choice
 
05:13:40.638 --> 05:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
having a voucher a housing choice
voucher

05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
voucher
 
05:13:44.070 --> 05:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
um and i would just say i think
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
several other concerns
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
um are addressed from the two
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
exceptions in this bill either that the
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
market rate is above what the
 
05:13:54.550 --> 05:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
payment standard is for the housing
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
authority or that the housing itself
 
05:14:01.270 --> 05:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney lincoln any questions
 
05:14:04.830 --> 05:14:04.840 align:start position:0%

05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
the team and staff are largely overseen
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
by the head coach school administration
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
athletic association or club in
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the local sponsor or
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
school administrator for
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
that specific activity
 
05:19:04.310 --> 05:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
officials don't manage those things it
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
is important to understand that the
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
sports officials are directed to appear
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
to perform a limited function at a
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
sporting event and after it is over they
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
then leave as their responsibilities
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
have been completed
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
remember that sports officials are
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
required to be neutral
 
05:19:26.708 --> 05:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
independent and unbiased during the
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
athletic event they are officiating
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
in doing so sports officials basically
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
perform the role of judges within that
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
sporting event
 
05:19:40.150 --> 05:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
however unlike state judges who enjoy
 
05:19:43.270 --> 05:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
complete legal immunity in the discharge
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
of their public duties
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
sports officials
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
currently are legally subject to
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
personal liability and being sued for
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
blowing their whistles or not blowing
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
their whistles throwing a flag or not
 
05:20:01.830 --> 05:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
throwing a flag making a call or even
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
exercising their judgment not to do so
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
since tv commentating and instant replay
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
have become so predominant in the
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
broadcasting of sports throughout our
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
country technology has made officiating
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
even harder with people constantly
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
second guessing what sports officials do
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
or don't do
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
even at the state level
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
what has happened is that during the
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
past decades sports officials across the
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
country have become targets of
 
05:20:38.548 --> 05:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
negligence lawsuits which should have no
 
05:20:41.030 --> 05:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
place in our courts
 
05:20:41.040 --> 05:20:42.590 align:start position:0%
place in our courts
the

05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%

05:20:46.350 --> 05:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
nhiaa standing for new hampshire
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
inter-scholastic athletic association

coordinates athletic competition
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%

sports official groups
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
each sport is regulated by a governing
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
body which specifically organizes trains
 
05:21:14.548 --> 05:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
and then certifies qualified men and
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
women to officiate sporting events in
 
05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%

in the past the first nhiaa
 
05:21:29.310 --> 05:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
executive director submitted testimony
 
05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
encouraging the committee to pass this
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill due to the problems that he
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
personally encountered because such
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
litigation has already created a climate
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
of fear and intimidation towards new
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire sports officials
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
while it may be pointed out that by
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
enacting the bill sports officials will
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
become a protected class
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
that from time to time happens in the
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
law as laws have been enacted to protect
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
various businesses involved in sports
 
05:22:06.320 --> 05:22:07.750 align:start position:0%
various businesses involved in sports
activities

05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
activities
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
ski operators who are protected from
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
negligence liability
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
are so under rsa 225
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
hyphen a colon 24.
 
05:22:25.590 --> 05:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
in summary please now vote in favor of
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1315
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
in an effort to help protect our
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
sporting officials and to recruit more
 
05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
for years down the line as i know we're
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
all very cognizant of how very important
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%

next would be
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%

thank you representatives um good
 
05:23:59.430 --> 05:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for the opportunity
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
to testify before you my name is marissa
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
chase i'm the executive director of the
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association for justice
 
05:24:07.830 --> 05:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
which is a statewide association of
 
05:24:07.840 --> 05:24:09.270 align:start position:0%
which is a statewide association of
attorneys

05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
mostly representing the interests of
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs in our state
 
05:24:16.230 --> 05:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill because
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
immunities are a dog whistle
 
05:24:21.830 --> 05:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
in our organization
 
05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
immunity is giving any actor who's
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
defined carte blanche to act without
 
05:24:28.080 --> 05:24:29.590 align:start position:0%
defined carte blanche to act without
responsibility

05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a negligence
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
negligence is a high bar to meet
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
to bring a negligence claim you have to
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
prove that the person you are you know
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
suing civilly
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
acted in a way that a reasonable person
 
05:24:45.030 --> 05:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
would not under the same or similar
 
05:24:45.040 --> 05:24:46.628 align:start position:0%
would not under the same or similar
circumstances

05:24:46.628 --> 05:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is a bridge too far
 
05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
to grant this to paid sports officials
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
we view this through a lens of safety
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
and responsibility any bill that again
 
05:24:58.390 --> 05:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
grants brought immunity to any defined
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
actor waves that actors responsibility
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
sports officials have a duty of care to
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that children are operating in a
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
safe environment using safe equipment
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
earlier in another hearing we talked
 
05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
about ministerial and discretionary
 
05:25:10.638 --> 05:25:12.788 align:start position:0%
about ministerial and discretionary
duties

05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
duties
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
what if a soccer coach sees a child get
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
hit in the head but fails to stop the
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
game so the proper pro concussion
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
protocols can happen
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
the child then collapses with a serious
 
05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
head injury which could have been
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
minimized had the game been stopped
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
earlier what about any sort of shooting
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
sport where a referee clearly sees
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
someone not handling their weapon
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
properly shouldn't they have a duty to
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
either take them out of the contest or
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
correct the dangerous situation before
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
another contestant is injured
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
we understand that referees can't be
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for the normal injuries
 
05:25:41.990 --> 05:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
faced during sports sprained ankles
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
injuries etc nor do we expect them to
 
05:25:47.430 --> 05:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
control the crowd of you know
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
impassioned onlookers
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
but they do make a lot of critical calls
 
05:25:53.350 --> 05:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
that if left without the responsibility
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
to do so could lead to unnecessary risk
 
05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and injury
 
05:25:58.548 --> 05:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
again it's very hard to bring a civil
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
claim in new hampshire especially i
 
05:26:05.590 --> 05:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
i can't see the examples i can't think
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the examples that representative the
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
spoke of earlier
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
but truly the only the only immunity you
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
need is to act responsibly as a
 
05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would under the
 
05:26:18.000 --> 05:26:19.510 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would under the
circumstances

05:26:19.510 --> 05:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to point out that our
 
05:26:21.600 --> 05:26:22.470 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to point out that our
state

05:26:22.470 --> 05:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
um does not our courts do not recognize
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
gross negligence
 
05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
our courts have never interpreted that
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
we don't recognize degrees of negligence
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
in this state in the civil context
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i would also say
 
05:26:36.868 --> 05:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is very overly broad it does
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
not define good faith
 
05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
so we respectfully urge you to vote in
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative walper
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.798 --> 05:26:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
have a hard time with the idea that
 
05:26:58.868 --> 05:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
officials are responsible for the
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
equipment that
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
like hockey player or football player or
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
anybody might actually be using i'm
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
having a very difficult time thinking
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
charged with some kind of negligence
 
05:27:13.510 --> 05:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
that could say lead to an injury that
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
would really do awesome
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
oh well thank you
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
guess that qualifies us a question um
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:33.510 --> 05:27:33.520 align:start position:0%

i've been high school football officials
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
since 2000
 
05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
and a college ncaa football official
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
since 2017.
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
and sadly
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have um a problem with liability
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
what you have in front of you is a
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
letter from patrick corbin
 
05:28:52.548 --> 05:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
he was our first
 
05:28:55.110 --> 05:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
executive director of the nhia and he
 
05:28:55.120 --> 05:28:56.390 align:start position:0%
executive director of the nhia and he
himself

05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
himself
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
was sued
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
for being an official
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
he was a soccer official
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
up in lebanon and hanover
 
05:29:05.590 --> 05:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
and as a part of
 
05:29:07.750 --> 05:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
one of the games that he officiated up
 
05:29:10.230 --> 05:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
there because it's kind of a rivalry so
 
05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
he told me
 
05:29:12.868 --> 05:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
was that
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
things got out of hand
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
some kids
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
injured each other and so
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
their lawyers sued everybody the school
 
05:29:22.708 --> 05:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
system school administration
 
05:29:24.150 --> 05:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
the coaches
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
and himself
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the case itself
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
took years and wound up in the new
 
05:29:32.948 --> 05:29:32.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
he had absolutely nothing to do with it
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
and yet he had to pay time and attention
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:29:40.320 --> 05:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
to that
unfairly

05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
unfairly
 
05:29:44.230 --> 05:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
as chief justice roberts of the u.s
 
05:29:46.390 --> 05:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court once said
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
um judges
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
in an analogy to sports officials are
 
05:29:49.920 --> 05:29:50.788 align:start position:0%
in an analogy to sports officials are
like

05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:29:50.798 --> 05:29:51.750 align:start position:0%
like
um

05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:51.760 --> 05:29:53.430 align:start position:0%
um
umpires

05:29:53.430 --> 05:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
umpires
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
they call balls and strikes they don't
 
05:29:55.760 --> 05:29:56.548 align:start position:0%
they call balls and strikes they don't
pitch

05:29:56.548 --> 05:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
pitch
 
05:29:58.868 --> 05:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
and they don't catch
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
their role is very limited
 
05:30:03.830 --> 05:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have recognized
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
some of the difficulties that sports
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
officials have
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
by creating a community for volunteer
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
high school and
 
05:30:13.200 --> 05:30:14.150 align:start position:0%
high school and
youth

05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
youth
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
coaches as well as officials they have
 
05:30:19.830 --> 05:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:22.548 --> 05:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
the issue has become more difficult
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
for officials because
 
05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
upset i'll say with game situations
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps if you all caught the 49ers
 
05:30:38.000 --> 05:30:38.948 align:start position:0%
perhaps if you all caught the 49ers
and

05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
dallas cowboy game last weekend
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
um there was a tough officiating call at
 
05:30:46.948 --> 05:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
the end of the game
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
the dallas cowboys ran a play
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
ran out of time
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
what was the reaction the reaction folks
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
if you didn't happen to catch it was
 
05:30:57.990 --> 05:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
texans that were there and other
 
05:30:59.440 --> 05:31:00.868 align:start position:0%
texans that were there and other
citizens

05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
aimed garbage and things at the
 
05:31:04.390 --> 05:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
officials because they didn't like the
 
05:31:04.400 --> 05:31:06.230 align:start position:0%
officials because they didn't like the
call

05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
call
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
that was unfortunate
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
it was unfortunately things like that
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
have grown
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh a number of states now have
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
harassment legislation and things like
 
05:31:16.558 --> 05:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
harassment legislation and things like
that

05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
but it's easy when you're doing
 
05:31:21.040 --> 05:31:22.548 align:start position:0%
but it's easy when you're doing
um

05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
wide scale litigation to include anybody
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
and everybody that was there
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to carve out
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
a protection for sports officials you
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
say well
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
why ryan well because of the liability
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
because the compensation for doing high
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
school games is less than a hundred
 
05:31:42.400 --> 05:31:43.910 align:start position:0%
school games is less than a hundred
dollars

05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
in football or baseball or basketball or
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:31:52.190 --> 05:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
why buy a two-year
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
multi-thousand dollar case litigation
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
just because you've got a hundred
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars to do the game and get caught up
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
into that
 
05:32:01.990 --> 05:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's not fair
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
as i said
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
the people that run the program um the
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
owners much like on landlord liability
 
05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
um are limited because they're a
 
05:32:13.040 --> 05:32:14.390 align:start position:0%
um are limited because they're a
non-profit

non-profit

or governmental entity but not the
 
05:32:16.480 --> 05:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
or governmental entity but not the
officials

05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
officials
 
05:32:22.070 --> 05:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
um it was previously pointed out that
 
05:32:22.080 --> 05:32:23.110 align:start position:0%
um it was previously pointed out that
that

05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
that wanton and gross negligence
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
isn't a part of new hampshire law well i
 
05:32:29.510 --> 05:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
would commend you to read some of the
 
05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions that are put in rsa 508
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
for example for the fire responders
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement
 
05:32:40.470 --> 05:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
for a landlord
 
05:32:40.480 --> 05:32:41.270 align:start position:0%
for a landlord
for

05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:32:43.830 --> 05:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the good samaritans it also uses the
 
05:32:43.840 --> 05:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
the good samaritans it also uses the
language

05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:32:48.070 --> 05:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
gross negligence
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
and intentional torts
 
05:32:52.390 --> 05:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i would commend you when you hear
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
that that's not the case
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
it isn't part it is part of new
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire law it's specifically printed
 
05:32:59.920 --> 05:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire law it's specifically printed
there

05:33:01.590 --> 05:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:33:01.600 --> 05:33:02.788 align:start position:0%
there
uh

05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
as far as the comments that there's a
 
05:33:05.830 --> 05:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
duty of
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh to inspect the equipment that's not
 
05:33:08.558 --> 05:33:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh to inspect the equipment that's not
so

05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
in fact what happens is the officials
 
05:33:14.948 --> 05:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
when we start out we ask the coaches to
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
make a representation
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
in high school orally and in college in
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
writing that they're properly equipped
 
05:33:24.310 --> 05:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
we can't second guess
 
05:33:27.270 --> 05:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
a hundred people on each side um
 
05:33:29.190 --> 05:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
kids and and uh
 
05:33:29.200 --> 05:33:30.390 align:start position:0%
kids and and uh
collegians

05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
collegians
 
05:33:31.990 --> 05:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether they're properly equipped
 
05:33:32.948 --> 05:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
required nor responsible for whether
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
they are properly equipped it's the
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
coaching it's the school
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
same type of thing with head injuries
 
05:33:45.350 --> 05:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
if we recognize it but recall these are
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
citizens that aren't doctors or emts
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
and they do the best they can but you
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
can't catch everything that happens on
 
05:33:54.868 --> 05:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
the field there's only seven of us
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
in college and only five of us in high
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
school on the football field at a given
 
05:33:59.520 --> 05:34:00.390 align:start position:0%
school on the football field at a given
time

05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
and you're talking 22 kids
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
out there
 
05:34:03.600 --> 05:34:04.868 align:start position:0%
out there
so

05:34:04.868 --> 05:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:06.788 --> 05:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
05:34:09.990 --> 05:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that it was just mentioned previously
 
05:34:12.150 --> 05:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
that we're responsible for that for
 
05:34:13.830 --> 05:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
identifying that
 
05:34:13.840 --> 05:34:16.390 align:start position:0%
identifying that
is

05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:16.400 --> 05:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
difficult

05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's easy to miss it especially if you
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
05:34:23.990 --> 05:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
participant are you okay and he says
 
05:34:24.000 --> 05:34:25.430 align:start position:0%
participant are you okay and he says
yeah

05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:34:26.788 --> 05:34:26.798 align:start position:0%
and i've had that happen to me many
 
05:34:26.798 --> 05:34:28.150 align:start position:0%
and i've had that happen to me many
times

05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i've had to order them off the field
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
on occasion if i feel that that's not
 
05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
true but i'm not an emt
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
i just have to use my my my judgment in
 
05:34:39.030 --> 05:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
that reaction but that doesn't mean that
 
05:34:40.628 --> 05:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
it's that the kid doesn't have a problem
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
but it's the coach's responsibility
 
05:34:45.830 --> 05:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
to monitor that behavior not the
 
05:34:45.840 --> 05:34:46.868 align:start position:0%
to monitor that behavior not the
officials

05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
officials
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
in the first instance
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
um and the same thing with shooting
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
institution be it the school if it's
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
sponsoring it or
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
whatever the club is
 
05:35:00.638 --> 05:35:01.590 align:start position:0%
whatever the club is
it's

05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
not the firearms
 
05:35:04.320 --> 05:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
not the firearms
official

05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
official
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for those type of
 
05:35:08.160 --> 05:35:09.670 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for those type of
actions

05:35:09.670 --> 05:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
actions
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
in those instances and in fact there's
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
an exception in the law unlimited
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
liability for
 
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
firearms in that situation too
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in 508. is there any
 
05:35:23.350 --> 05:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions that i can answer
 
05:35:27.670 --> 05:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to um
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
say that yes gross negligence is written
 
05:35:52.948 --> 05:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
in our statutes i stated our courts have
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
not interpreted what gross negligence
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
means our courts have not interpreted
 
05:35:59.430 --> 05:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
degrees of negligence in the civil
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
setting that's not to say they're not on
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
the books the other thing i didn't
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
mention a duty of equipment but a duty
 
05:36:08.070 --> 05:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
of care and a duty of care is essential
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
in a negligence claim to determine who's
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
responsible that's all i wanted to
 
05:36:12.080 --> 05:36:13.110 align:start position:0%
responsible that's all i wanted to
clarify

05:36:13.110 --> 05:36:13.120 align:start position:0%

and i will call upon the prime sponsor
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee yes
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm melissa blasik and i represent
 
05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
hillsborough 21 the town of merrimack
 
05:47:24.628 --> 05:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to introduce hb 1425 fn
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to amend rsa 446
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency statutes are rsa
 
05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
4 45 through 4 447
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
rsa 446 grants the executive branch the
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
ability to seize private property during
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
it was not used at all during the
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
covid19 state of emergency and i don't
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
believe it has ever been implemented
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
however no one knows what the future
 
05:47:51.590 --> 05:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
holds and while many of us agree that
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
emergency authority must exist for
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances that
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
authority should still be tailored to
 
05:47:59.910 --> 05:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
prevent potential abuse of power
 
05:48:01.750 --> 05:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
people's natural rights do not cease to
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
exist during an emergency and those
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
rights must remain protected
 
05:48:08.708 --> 05:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
to quote james madison an elective
 
05:48:10.470 --> 05:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
despotism was not the government we
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
fought for but one in which the powers
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
of government should be so divided and
 
05:48:16.470 --> 05:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
balanced among the several bodies of
 
05:48:19.030 --> 05:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
majesty is that no one could transcend
 
05:48:20.470 --> 05:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
their legal limits without being
 
05:48:22.230 --> 05:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
effectually checked and restrained by
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
the others
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
state of emergency powers hand an
 
05:48:26.708 --> 05:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of authority to the
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch and i believe it is our
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
duty to restrain this authority as much
 
05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
as possible while still allowing the
 
05:48:35.910 --> 05:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch to handle any emergency
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
that may arise
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
this bill makes several changes to the
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
existing statute it adds language that
 
05:48:44.310 --> 05:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
there must be a documented inability to
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
obtain alternative resources before
 
05:48:48.548 --> 05:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
taking private property
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
it adds more compensation for the taking
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
of the property and it ensures that once
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
the state no longer needs the property
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
that the owner has the right of first
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
refusal to purchase it back at
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
prevailing market price
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
this bill justly places the entire cost
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
burden associated with eminent domain
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency in the hands
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the state where it belongs
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony i'd be happy
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:21.990 --> 05:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
i have a stack here
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
that i thought had been handed out but
 
05:49:30.390 --> 05:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:36.470 --> 05:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
no that's not it i put it right there
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:51.120 --> 05:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative langley thank you mr
 
05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
chair i'm sorry i was slow on this one
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
can you can you clarify for me um
 
05:50:04.788 --> 05:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
under when documented when there's a
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
documented inability to obtain
 
05:50:08.788 --> 05:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
alternative resources
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
if you if the state was going to
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
take property i mean how is that work
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
would it it would it be if i had money
 
05:50:20.310 --> 05:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
that was so
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
valuable as it currently as the law
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently stands
 
05:50:23.760 --> 05:50:24.548 align:start position:0%
currently stands
um

05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
the burden is not on the state to show
 
05:50:29.830 --> 05:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they have no resources of their own
 
05:50:29.840 --> 05:50:31.350 align:start position:0%
that they have no resources of their own
to

05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:50:34.390 --> 05:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
take someone else's property so this is
 
05:50:36.310 --> 05:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
just that it has to be documented in
 
05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
writing that the state doesn't have any
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:45.910 --> 05:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:50:53.670 --> 05:50:53.680 align:start position:0%

05:51:01.590 --> 05:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the hearing on
 
05:51:20.948 --> 05:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
and we'll just be in recess till three
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%

okay we'll call the house judiciary
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%

06:03:40.230 --> 06:03:40.240 align:start position:0%

06:03:45.110 --> 06:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's prohibiting the placement of
 
06:03:47.270 --> 06:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris in
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
landfills and we'll call upon the
 
06:03:52.150 --> 06:03:52.160 align:start position:0%

06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm pleased to host you
 
06:04:11.350 --> 06:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
06:04:12.470 --> 06:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to give you a little bit
 
06:04:15.430 --> 06:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
of background on this bill because i was
 
06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
thinking you know how much does
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
judiciary really know about waste and
 
06:04:20.470 --> 06:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
recycling and construction and
 
06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
demolition debris so let me just give
 
06:04:24.788 --> 06:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of history
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
the house
 
06:04:31.830 --> 06:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
convened a commission to look at
 
06:04:33.510 --> 06:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
recycling and debris and understand
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on with our landfills and
 
06:04:38.310 --> 06:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
what we're accepting in terms of waste
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
so there were a series of
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
 
06:04:43.360 --> 06:04:44.868 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
commission

06:04:44.868 --> 06:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:04:46.628 --> 06:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
and one of those is currently a task
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
force that's looking at ways that we can
 
06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
effectively reduce waste in landfills
 
06:04:54.310 --> 06:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
and of course one of those big issues
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about
 
06:04:58.628 --> 06:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
since 2019
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
is what's going on with construction and
 
06:05:02.788 --> 06:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
demolition debris specifically so to set
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
the table for you
 
06:05:05.670 --> 06:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
you kind of need to understand what's
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
happening in the states surrounding new
 
06:05:07.520 --> 06:05:09.190 align:start position:0%
happening in the states surrounding new
hampshire

06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
so just historically i've given you the
 
06:05:15.030 --> 06:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
first i believe the first five pages
 
06:05:18.070 --> 06:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's 2019 biennial solid
 
06:05:20.310 --> 06:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
waste report it's got a
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful new hampshire department of
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
environmental services logo on the
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
bottom of that report
 
06:05:26.948 --> 06:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
i didn't print the whole thing because i
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
think the most important thing to look
 
06:05:28.558 --> 06:05:31.110 align:start position:0%
think the most important thing to look
at

06:05:31.110 --> 06:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
is what's been going on
 
06:05:36.470 --> 06:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:38.948 --> 06:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
on officially page one at the bottom the
 
06:05:38.958 --> 06:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
on officially page one at the bottom the
introduction

06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
so in 1990 we're looking at paragraph
 
06:05:44.080 --> 06:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
so in 1990 we're looking at paragraph
two

06:05:45.590 --> 06:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:05:49.430 --> 06:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 149m was amended to establish a a
 
06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goal
 
06:05:52.708 --> 06:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
a current version of the school
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
established in 1999
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
was to divert 40 percent of new
 
06:05:57.430 --> 06:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire's solid waste from final
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
disposal by the year 2000
 
06:06:02.230 --> 06:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
in order to reduce the quantity of solid
 
06:06:02.240 --> 06:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
in order to reduce the quantity of solid
waste

06:06:03.750 --> 06:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
waste
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we've been
 
06:06:06.548 --> 06:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
working on
 
06:06:09.030 --> 06:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
since 1990 is to continually reduce
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
solid waste in our landfills
 
06:06:13.590 --> 06:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
interesting to note
 
06:06:13.600 --> 06:06:18.310 align:start position:0%
interesting to note
that

06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:20.230 --> 06:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
the way that our department of
 
06:06:22.230 --> 06:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
environmental services addresses waste
 
06:06:23.430 --> 06:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
is through what's called a waste
 
06:06:23.440 --> 06:06:24.948 align:start position:0%
is through what's called a waste
hierarchy

06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
hierarchy
 
06:06:29.110 --> 06:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
so looking at the bottom of page one
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
the very last thing you want to be doing
 
06:06:33.350 --> 06:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
with waste is putting it in a landfill
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
right that's at the very bottom of the
 
06:06:34.798 --> 06:06:36.788 align:start position:0%
right that's at the very bottom of the
pyramid

06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
pyramid
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
the most preferred is source reduction
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
so let's get rid of things that we
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be throwing away anyway often
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
in practice that looks like changing
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:51.430 --> 06:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
disposable containers to reusable
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
containers you'll often see that you can
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
purchase at some stores liquid detergent
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
in your own container rather than
 
06:06:59.430 --> 06:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing detergent in a plastic
 
06:07:01.830 --> 06:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
container that would be source reduction
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
the next is recycling and reuse and so
 
06:07:06.390 --> 06:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
once again i'm setting the table here
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
in the last five years we've seen a huge
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
increase in recycling and reuse of
 
06:07:12.548 --> 06:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
construction materials in our
 
06:07:14.070 --> 06:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
06:07:14.080 --> 06:07:14.948 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
so

06:07:14.948 --> 06:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
i provided a little bit of background
 
06:07:18.868 --> 06:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
information from the
 
06:07:20.948 --> 06:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
sisters to the new hampshire department
 
06:07:23.990 --> 06:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
of environmental services we have
 
06:07:25.830 --> 06:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts
 
06:07:25.840 --> 06:07:27.190 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts
it's

06:07:27.190 --> 06:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:07:29.430 --> 06:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
make sure i get this right
 
06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts is the department of
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
environmental protection
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's the dep i believe that's also
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
environmental protection and then in
 
06:07:40.470 --> 06:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
vermont it's the department of
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
environmental conservation
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
so in these three states in the last
 
06:07:46.948 --> 06:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
five years what they've started to do
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
is to track and divert
 
06:07:52.470 --> 06:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris when
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
it comes to a facility to be processed
 
06:07:57.030 --> 06:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
i think that's really important that
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
they've set goals for how much they will
 
06:07:59.280 --> 06:08:00.868 align:start position:0%
they've set goals for how much they will
accept

06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
accept
 
06:08:03.430 --> 06:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
and in both vermont and maine they've
 
06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
created facilities that are specific to
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris so
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
let's just say your general contractor
 
06:08:12.390 --> 06:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're tearing down an old house
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
you need to bring all the waste that
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
ends up in your dumpsters to a c d
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
facility if you're working in maine and
 
06:08:18.240 --> 06:08:19.350 align:start position:0%
facility if you're working in maine and
vermont

06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
06:08:19.360 --> 06:08:20.470 align:start position:0%
vermont
or

06:08:20.470 --> 06:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:08:23.110 --> 06:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
you can bring it to new hampshire
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
and so what we're seeing statistically
 
06:08:28.310 --> 06:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
data wise in the last five years is the
 
06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
amount of waste that we are receiving
 
06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
from out of state has gone up
 
06:08:34.310 --> 06:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 50
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying that it's all
 
06:08:37.990 --> 06:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris but
 
06:08:40.830 --> 06:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
there seems to be perhaps some kind of a
 
06:08:43.590 --> 06:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
correlation between massachusetts who
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
has the strictest rules we'll talk about
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
them in a minute
 
06:08:48.868 --> 06:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont who've set up their
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
own c d facilities and are requiring
 
06:08:51.680 --> 06:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
own c d facilities and are requiring
recycling

06:08:53.030 --> 06:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire not actually having
 
06:08:57.030 --> 06:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
rules on the books right now to address
 
06:08:59.110 --> 06:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
that so there may be something about
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
that influx of waste coming from out of
 
06:09:00.958 --> 06:09:01.830 align:start position:0%
that influx of waste coming from out of
state

06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:09:01.840 --> 06:09:02.628 align:start position:0%
state
but

06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:09:05.190 --> 06:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
um it's also coming from in-state right
 
06:09:06.390 --> 06:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're in the midst of a huge
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
construction boom and we have limited
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
sites on which to build new houses so
 
06:09:12.788 --> 06:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
often what you're seeing is these old
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
1920s 1940s cottages are being torn down
 
06:09:18.548 --> 06:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
the waste has to go somewhere
 
06:09:20.070 --> 06:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
and then a new home is built on the same
 
06:09:20.080 --> 06:09:21.030 align:start position:0%
and then a new home is built on the same
lot

06:09:21.030 --> 06:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
lot
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
so we're not innocent of sending waste
 
06:09:27.750 --> 06:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
to our facilities that is the c d type
 
06:09:30.310 --> 06:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
so the intention with creating this bill
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
and i know it's a really simple bill
 
06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's just one single line saying
 
06:09:38.230 --> 06:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
prohibiting any landfill permitted by
 
06:09:40.150 --> 06:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
the department that would be des from
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
accepting construction and demolition
 
06:09:41.760 --> 06:09:44.788 align:start position:0%
accepting construction and demolition
debris

06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
and then setting a fine for anyone who
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually does it
 
06:09:50.948 --> 06:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
the intention here is to set up just
 
06:09:53.110 --> 06:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
like we've seen
 
06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
in maine and
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
in vermont
 
06:09:58.230 --> 06:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
a facility that can receive construction
 
06:09:59.750 --> 06:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
and demolition debris
 
06:10:01.590 --> 06:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
and not send it to the very bottom of
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
this pyramid here land filling
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
they can come up with alternative and
 
06:10:08.788 --> 06:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
additional uses for things like
 
06:10:12.628 --> 06:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
clean drywall or recycling dirty drywall
 
06:10:12.638 --> 06:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
clean drywall or recycling dirty drywall
studs

06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
studs
 
06:10:13.760 --> 06:10:14.948 align:start position:0%
studs
um

06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:17.670 --> 06:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
asphalt shingles all of these can find a
 
06:10:19.110 --> 06:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
better purpose than ending up in our
 
06:10:19.120 --> 06:10:20.548 align:start position:0%
better purpose than ending up in our
landfills

06:10:20.548 --> 06:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
06:10:20.558 --> 06:10:21.270 align:start position:0%
landfills
so

06:10:21.270 --> 06:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
i promised i'd get to massachusetts this
 
06:10:24.708 --> 06:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
is probably the strictest and the most
 
06:10:26.470 --> 06:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
complicated one but it's worth talking
 
06:10:26.480 --> 06:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
complicated one but it's worth talking
about

06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
so what massachusetts has done is
 
06:10:32.070 --> 06:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
they've created
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
a construction and demolition handling
 
06:10:36.548 --> 06:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
facility criteria
 
06:10:38.788 --> 06:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's worth looking at
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
because they've set a percentage goal
 
06:10:43.670 --> 06:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
for process separation
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
for facilities that are receiving
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
construction demolition debris and
 
06:10:49.590 --> 06:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're split out into
 
06:10:51.510 --> 06:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
different piles of things
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
often this means that you're requiring
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
the contractor to separate it on site so
 
06:10:58.470 --> 06:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
when it arrives at the facility you're
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
not doing the the dump of all the stuff
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
on the concrete pad and having to go
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
through it to pull out studs versus
 
06:11:07.110 --> 06:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
drywall versus bat insulation
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's all separated already by the time
 
06:11:11.190 --> 06:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
it gets to the facility
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the goal in massachusetts is to
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
achieve right now as of october 2021 so
 
06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're still under the current
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
requirements in mass
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
the goal is to achieve a process
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
separation rate minimum threshold of 15
 
06:11:23.520 --> 06:11:25.270 align:start position:0%
separation rate minimum threshold of 15
percent

06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:11:27.270 --> 06:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then demonstrate that the waistband
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
materials are separated so wasteband
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
materials would include things like
 
06:11:33.430 --> 06:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
drywall studs asphalt shingles
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the greatest extent possible where
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
all human mistakes happen
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to be perfect when
 
06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
you're handling waste
 
06:11:41.200 --> 06:11:42.150 align:start position:0%
you're handling waste
so

06:11:42.150 --> 06:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:43.990 --> 06:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
you don't fail you don't get kicked out
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the program there's just sort of a
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
retraining process if you're not able to
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
achieve that 15
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold but i think that
 
06:11:52.948 --> 06:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
that's something worth looking at as
 
06:11:54.868 --> 06:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
well in new hampshire where right now
 
06:11:57.030 --> 06:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
when we receive waste at a facility it
 
06:11:58.868 --> 06:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
may or may not be already separated by a
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
contractor there may not be an
 
06:12:01.830 --> 06:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to separate it when it's
 
06:12:03.750 --> 06:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
already tipped on the floor
 
06:12:05.430 --> 06:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
so we're just looking at as i said
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
neighboring states what their policies
 
06:12:10.390 --> 06:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
are with c d waste what we can do better
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
06:12:14.390 --> 06:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this is probably the
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
lowest hanging fruit for us to change
 
06:12:19.350 --> 06:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
our regulations to make it easier for
 
06:12:21.110 --> 06:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
people to separate out before it gets to
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
a facility push that back on the
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
contractors who are already doing it in
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire maine vermont i'm sorry
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing it at main vermont and
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and many of these
 
06:12:32.708 --> 06:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
contractors are working in multiple
 
06:12:32.718 --> 06:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
contractors are working in multiple
states

06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:12:35.350 --> 06:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
so we would be looking to do more of a
 
06:12:37.110 --> 06:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
uniform requirement they separate out
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
the waste before it comes here
 
06:12:40.868 --> 06:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
so i'm not saying that the wording of my
 
06:12:43.030 --> 06:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill is exactly what i'd like it to be
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
but i think there's a conversation to be
 
06:12:46.948 --> 06:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
had here so with that i'm happy to take
 
06:12:49.030 --> 06:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
06:12:49.040 --> 06:12:50.230 align:start position:0%
some questions
questions

06:12:50.230 --> 06:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:12:52.948 --> 06:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
for representative williams
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative simpson
 
06:12:56.788 --> 06:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:58.470 --> 06:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
my question um i just wanted to clarify
 
06:13:02.948 --> 06:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
the 15
 
06:13:02.958 --> 06:13:04.070 align:start position:0%
the 15
is

06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:13:06.948 --> 06:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
like the contractors trying to get down
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
to that amount that smaller amount that
 
06:13:11.590 --> 06:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
would have to be processed at the
 
06:13:11.600 --> 06:13:13.990 align:start position:0%
would have to be processed at the
facility

06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:13:15.510 --> 06:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
that would have to be separated rather
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
at the facility like separating the
 
06:13:20.310 --> 06:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
other 85 percent at the site i'm sorry i
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
didn't understand what the 15 was so the
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
goal is that the facility
 
06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
needs to hit a 15 separation rate it's a
 
06:13:30.628 --> 06:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
low first step first threshold to only
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
get to 15.
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
it will probably go up again in a couple
 
06:13:36.470 --> 06:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
of years to something like 20 percent
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then 25
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
in a couple more years the goal is to be
 
06:13:42.708 --> 06:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
training people who are doing this type
 
06:13:44.948 --> 06:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
of work and demolishing buildings
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
bringing it to a facility that they need
 
06:13:48.708 --> 06:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
to separate it out more and more and
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
more and it becomes more normal so 15 is
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
just the threshold first step small
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:03.430 --> 06:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
so if
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
contractors are going to be separating
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
this stuff out that means more work for
 
06:14:12.548 --> 06:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
them uh we've already got a monstrous
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
housing crunch
 
06:14:14.320 --> 06:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
housing crunch
um

06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:17.590 --> 06:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
is this going to cost
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
you know is going to rise raise
 
06:14:23.190 --> 06:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing in the state
 
06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting conundrum for the
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
trade-off right so what we're talking
 
06:14:29.190 --> 06:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
about is an upfront cost
 
06:14:31.350 --> 06:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
for demolition as part of construction
 
06:14:33.750 --> 06:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
or just demolition as part of a project
 
06:14:35.510 --> 06:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
you may just be demoing and having land
 
06:14:35.520 --> 06:14:36.868 align:start position:0%
you may just be demoing and having land
afterwards

06:14:36.868 --> 06:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
06:14:38.868 --> 06:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to that
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then there's the cost to the state
 
06:14:44.070 --> 06:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
to be land filling long-term materials
 
06:14:45.510 --> 06:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
that don't necessarily need to be
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
landfilled right so there's a value a
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
cost that you could associate with with
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
a cleanup
 
06:14:51.990 --> 06:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
later on
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
or with just having to increase
 
06:14:56.548 --> 06:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
footprint of landfill now right there
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
these are two costs that have to be
 
06:14:58.080 --> 06:15:00.548 align:start position:0%
these are two costs that have to be
balanced

06:15:00.548 --> 06:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
balanced
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have any studies actually
 
06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
weighing what the cost is
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
for measuring and separating out
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
demolition debris for new hampshire
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
projects i think that would be a good
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
number to get
 
06:15:12.628 --> 06:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
but i would say that just looking at it
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
from a big picture we can't continue on
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
the same road we've been going on which
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
is accepting construction and demolition
 
06:15:20.788 --> 06:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
debris from all our neighbors whoever
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
wants to bring anything will take it and
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases it ends up in a
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
landfill right that's not sustainable we
 
06:15:27.910 --> 06:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
can't keep doing that for the long term
 
06:15:33.510 --> 06:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
06:15:35.040 --> 06:15:37.750 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
mcwilliams

06:15:37.750 --> 06:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you
 
06:15:41.430 --> 06:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative walper
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:15:45.030 --> 06:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm slightly confounded here so when
 
06:15:49.670 --> 06:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
you say the 15
 
06:15:53.110 --> 06:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:56.548 --> 06:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
it sounds like all you're talking about
 
06:15:59.830 --> 06:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
sounds to me that uh is that like the
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
two by fours and nails going to one pile
 
06:16:04.390 --> 06:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
and the sheetrock goes in another pile
 
06:16:05.830 --> 06:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i take the same amount of stuff to
 
06:16:07.110 --> 06:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
the landfill
 
06:16:09.430 --> 06:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
so what am i missing here i'm sorry
 
06:16:10.948 --> 06:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
there's recycling right after the
 
06:16:10.958 --> 06:16:13.030 align:start position:0%
there's recycling right after the
separation

06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
separation
 
06:16:19.430 --> 06:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:21.670 --> 06:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
so so the
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so the 15
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that
 
06:16:27.830 --> 06:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the facility
 
06:16:27.840 --> 06:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
that the facility
will

06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:16:29.040 --> 06:16:30.070 align:start position:0%
will
um

06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:33.750 --> 06:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
recycle 15 percent more will vary 15
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
percent less
 
06:16:37.110 --> 06:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
which way are we looking at that
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
so they have to separate out that 15 to
 
06:16:41.910 --> 06:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
head to recycling
 
06:16:43.590 --> 06:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
and it really depends on how it's being
 
06:16:46.390 --> 06:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
recycled right so you can
 
06:16:48.310 --> 06:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
you can take asphalt shingles and grind
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
them down and they can be used for road
 
06:16:53.430 --> 06:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
work just as an example that's 100
 
06:16:56.230 --> 06:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
recycling of whatever 15
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
or less than 15 of the shingles you've
 
06:17:00.788 --> 06:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
salvaged of your overall
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
incoming trash right
 
06:17:06.150 --> 06:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
so the same thing with studs
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
wood studs if you've got them as a
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of your 15 percent
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to find another use for
 
06:17:11.520 --> 06:17:12.548 align:start position:0%
you're going to find another use for
them

06:17:12.548 --> 06:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe in new hampshire we're
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to burn them
 
06:17:18.470 --> 06:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
but often they end up getting buried so
 
06:17:20.548 --> 06:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
they become back to the earth material
 
06:17:20.558 --> 06:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
they become back to the earth material
again

06:17:23.910 --> 06:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:23.920 --> 06:17:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:17:26.470 --> 06:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the process that that you're
 
06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
promoting here is that the contractors
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
sort out the materials
 
06:17:37.270 --> 06:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
take them to the landfill
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
or to the the transfer transfer stations
 
06:17:41.590 --> 06:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a hard time with that in my
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
town as well
 
06:17:45.190 --> 06:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
right take them to the transfer station
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then transfer station
 
06:17:50.150 --> 06:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
distributes them to be recycled that's
 
06:17:51.670 --> 06:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
right the fifteen percent happens at the
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
transfer station and the fifteen percent
 
06:17:56.310 --> 06:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
is fifteen percent of what the facility
 
06:17:59.030 --> 06:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
takes in of that type of debris correct
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's the massachusetts standard okay i
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
get that
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
another one
 
06:18:08.230 --> 06:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay now how about the costs the cost of
 
06:18:09.990 --> 06:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's easy to envision the cost of
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
sorting and
 
06:18:12.868 --> 06:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
transporting or whatever that's going to
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
be increased on the contractor side of
 
06:18:14.718 --> 06:18:16.788 align:start position:0%
be increased on the contractor side of
it

06:18:16.788 --> 06:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:18:18.070 --> 06:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
06:18:21.030 --> 06:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the re to the transfer station and or
 
06:18:22.868 --> 06:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
to the which is only part of the cost of
 
06:18:24.788 --> 06:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
the state i think
 
06:18:24.798 --> 06:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
the state i think
from

06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:30.390 --> 06:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
is there
 
06:18:33.990 --> 06:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
is this a is this a cost item or a
 
06:18:38.390 --> 06:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
profit item for the transfer stations
 
06:18:39.910 --> 06:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know what we're seeing in other
 
06:18:39.920 --> 06:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
you know what we're seeing in other
states

06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:18:43.270 --> 06:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
is that it tends to be a wash
 
06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:44.478 align:start position:0%
but there are people here who will
 
06:18:46.628 --> 06:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
testify after me and give you real life
 
06:18:49.830 --> 06:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
stories i'm not in the industry so i
 
06:18:52.390 --> 06:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that every time you make
 
06:18:54.868 --> 06:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
up with recouping the sale versus the
 
06:18:57.190 --> 06:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
labor required to send it off site to
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
recycle i can't tell you that for sure
 
06:19:00.310 --> 06:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not in a position to make that
 
06:19:00.320 --> 06:19:01.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not in a position to make that
assurance

06:19:01.590 --> 06:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
06:19:04.390 --> 06:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that it seems to be
 
06:19:06.070 --> 06:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
worth it for these other states because
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:14.548 --> 06:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you
 
06:19:17.190 --> 06:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
can you talk 15 of you talking volume or
 
06:19:17.200 --> 06:19:19.910 align:start position:0%
can you talk 15 of you talking volume or
weight

06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
oh no good question
 
06:19:23.190 --> 06:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question i'm going
 
06:19:25.190 --> 06:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
to go back to this the sheet because i
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
don't have that at the tip of my fingers
 
06:19:40.310 --> 06:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:55.350 --> 06:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to get back to you on
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
whether it's weight or volume for the 15
 
06:20:00.548 --> 06:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
i know they measure both right they're
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
weighing the trucks and they're also
 
06:20:04.150 --> 06:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
saying that that looks like it appears
 
06:20:06.070 --> 06:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
to be a five yard dumpster or whatever
 
06:20:07.590 --> 06:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're bringing in
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll get back to you on that one
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:24.230 --> 06:20:24.240 align:start position:0%

06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman i'm going to
 
06:20:52.150 --> 06:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
take my mask off here
 
06:20:53.670 --> 06:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is bob
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
magnuson i
 
06:20:58.150 --> 06:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
have worked for 26 years for waste
 
06:20:58.160 --> 06:20:59.670 align:start position:0%
have worked for 26 years for waste
management

06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
management
 
06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
waste management is
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in the collection and
 
06:21:06.468 --> 06:21:06.478 align:start position:0%
transportation and disposal
 
06:21:09.510 --> 06:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
of c d materials in new hampshire
 
06:21:12.390 --> 06:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
through our network of collection
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
operations we run one out of rochester
 
06:21:18.070 --> 06:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
out of londonderry new hampton and keene
 
06:21:20.390 --> 06:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
we have we have a couple of transfer
 
06:21:20.400 --> 06:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
we have we have a couple of transfer
stations

06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
stations
 
06:21:21.600 --> 06:21:22.548 align:start position:0%
stations
where

06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
small vehicles come in with materials
 
06:21:25.750 --> 06:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then they they leave from there in
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
larger vehicles
 
06:21:30.070 --> 06:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
we have a transfer station in auburn and
 
06:21:32.548 --> 06:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
then one that we operate the city of
 
06:21:34.948 --> 06:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
laconia's facility and we have the
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
landfill over in rochester where we
 
06:21:41.350 --> 06:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
receive a variety of of materials
 
06:21:44.310 --> 06:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
so house bill 1544 an act prohibiting
 
06:21:45.590 --> 06:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
the placement of construction and
 
06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
demolition debris in landfills
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
while waste management we support
 
06:21:53.430 --> 06:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
various recycling initiatives
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
across the board whether it's municipal
 
06:21:57.110 --> 06:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
solid waste think of the paper and
 
06:21:58.628 --> 06:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
cardboard and things you might generate
 
06:22:01.510 --> 06:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
at your home as well as
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition on the
 
06:22:05.350 --> 06:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
commercial side we do
 
06:22:10.628 --> 06:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
i feel this is quite a jump to go from
 
06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
where we're at to the f
 
06:22:17.190 --> 06:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know potential fines and penalties
 
06:22:19.270 --> 06:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
that are outlined in this so in my
 
06:22:21.430 --> 06:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that i've provided the written
 
06:22:21.440 --> 06:22:24.150 align:start position:0%
testimony that i've provided the written
testimony

06:22:24.150 --> 06:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:22:26.390 --> 06:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
i did just pull out of the rsa what the
 
06:22:28.708 --> 06:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
definition of c and d is it's always
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
good to kind of refresh what we're
 
06:22:31.830 --> 06:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
c d is generated by most residents
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and institutions in the state
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
on a on a very routine basis
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
through any sort of construction
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
projects that might take place either at
 
06:22:43.030 --> 06:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
their home or their place their place of
 
06:22:43.040 --> 06:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
their home or their place their place of
work

06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:22:45.750 --> 06:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the definition
 
06:22:47.910 --> 06:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we're working from i
 
06:22:50.070 --> 06:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
again i put in the testimony
 
06:22:52.948 --> 06:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
how much c d are we talking about
 
06:22:54.548 --> 06:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
now new hampshire doesn't generate as
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
much c d as municipal solid waste what
 
06:22:59.590 --> 06:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
we generate in our home in our business
 
06:23:01.270 --> 06:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
or what's classified as municipal solid
 
06:23:01.280 --> 06:23:02.150 align:start position:0%
or what's classified as municipal solid
waste

06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
waste
 
06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
but the quantity is significant
 
06:23:06.230 --> 06:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's often
 
06:23:08.310 --> 06:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
related to economic activities and some
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
type of construction is involved
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
we did a review of the annual facility
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
reports those are reports that solid
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
waste facilities in new hampshire submit
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
every year to des
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
a little outdated so i think the numbers
 
06:23:21.270 --> 06:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:23:23.590 --> 06:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
in line with this but possibly higher we
 
06:23:25.708 --> 06:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
took a review of the
 
06:23:29.350 --> 06:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
2018 annual facility reports
 
06:23:32.230 --> 06:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
we did that review back in 19
 
06:23:33.990 --> 06:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that indicated there was
 
06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire generated over 425 000
 
06:23:40.150 --> 06:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
tons of c d
 
06:23:41.750 --> 06:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
with about a hundred and seventy seven
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred tons
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
sent to the two primarily primary
 
06:23:49.110 --> 06:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
privately owned c and d processing
 
06:23:50.788 --> 06:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
facilities which are located down in the
 
06:23:52.310 --> 06:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
southern tier of the state they're not
 
06:23:54.150 --> 06:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
waste management facilities
 
06:23:56.310 --> 06:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
they are facilities that we work
 
06:23:58.310 --> 06:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
closely with as our trucks will go into
 
06:23:59.590 --> 06:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
those facilities and some of the
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
products that they generate in their
 
06:24:04.150 --> 06:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
processing operation
 
06:24:06.948 --> 06:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
do require outlet at a landfill because
 
06:24:08.788 --> 06:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
there are not other
 
06:24:11.350 --> 06:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
viable outlets for those materials
 
06:24:15.030 --> 06:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
so there's a remaining 247 000 plus tons
 
06:24:17.190 --> 06:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
of unprocessed cnd
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
that went to
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
based on our review went to in-state and
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
out-of-state landfills for disposal
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
and it is important to note that c d
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
processing facilities
 
06:24:29.270 --> 06:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
do not recycle 100
 
06:24:31.110 --> 06:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
of what they receive
 
06:24:32.868 --> 06:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
and landfills are often an important
 
06:24:35.590 --> 06:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
outlet for several of the products
 
06:24:37.750 --> 06:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
that are generated by c d processing
 
06:24:39.830 --> 06:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
processing facilities
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
some of those materials that a c d
 
06:24:43.030 --> 06:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
processing facility might generate that
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
would end up in a landfill
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
they'll often screen out materials that
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have other outlets for
 
06:24:51.270 --> 06:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're called fines sometimes
 
06:24:53.030 --> 06:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're called screenings they can be
 
06:24:54.628 --> 06:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
used at landfills
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
to cover the waste at the end of the day
 
06:24:56.400 --> 06:24:57.270 align:start position:0%
to cover the waste at the end of the day
so

06:24:57.270 --> 06:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:59.030 --> 06:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's a higher use than just
 
06:25:02.230 --> 06:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
disposing of the unprocessed c and d but
 
06:25:04.150 --> 06:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
nonetheless it is going to a landfill
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
and in review of this language of this
 
06:25:05.920 --> 06:25:07.030 align:start position:0%
and in review of this language of this
bill

06:25:07.030 --> 06:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:25:08.788 --> 06:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
i take it to mean
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
any c d product couldn't go to a
 
06:25:12.788 --> 06:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
landfill which is which is
 
06:25:15.030 --> 06:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
quite encompassing
 
06:25:17.350 --> 06:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
some other materials that c d processing
 
06:25:19.350 --> 06:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
facilities generate
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
that might go to a landfill as there are
 
06:25:23.190 --> 06:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
wood products they'll often pull out the
 
06:25:24.788 --> 06:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
clean wood
 
06:25:27.190 --> 06:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
for wood fuels and other sort of wood
 
06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
products think of plywoods and press
 
06:25:31.830 --> 06:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
boards and things like that
 
06:25:34.310 --> 06:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
but there are other
 
06:25:36.468 --> 06:25:36.478 align:start position:0%
materials that they generate that
 
06:25:40.788 --> 06:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:43.990 --> 06:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
so as far as our first major opposition
 
06:25:45.590 --> 06:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
06:25:47.670 --> 06:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
is the fact that there currently do not
 
06:25:49.190 --> 06:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
exist in new hampshire processing
 
06:25:50.948 --> 06:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
facilities capable of taking on this
 
06:25:53.510 --> 06:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
quantity of material
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the small transfer stations that
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
might take in some of this material and
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
transfer it for disposal now
 
06:26:00.868 --> 06:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that they have the
 
06:26:03.830 --> 06:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
physical space to set up this separation
 
06:26:03.840 --> 06:26:05.670 align:start position:0%
physical space to set up this separation
and

06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:08.468 --> 06:26:08.478 align:start position:0%
it was alluded to
 
06:26:10.230 --> 06:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor of the bill about setting
 
06:26:13.190 --> 06:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
cans and containers up at construction
 
06:26:15.270 --> 06:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
facilities and that is a great
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the best way to get to it
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
but you got to get the build you got to
 
06:26:20.948 --> 06:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
get the contractors in here and have
 
06:26:23.670 --> 06:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
that dialogue because
 
06:26:23.680 --> 06:26:24.390 align:start position:0%
that dialogue because
the

06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:26:26.468 --> 06:26:26.478 align:start position:0%
setting up multiple containers for
 
06:26:28.150 --> 06:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
materials before they get mixed in with
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the weights is a great way of doing it
 
06:26:31.830 --> 06:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
but there are often constraints on
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
construction sites
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know what might be handled now in
 
06:26:36.708 --> 06:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
one container we might be talking about
 
06:26:38.868 --> 06:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
three four five containers additional
 
06:26:40.468 --> 06:26:40.478 align:start position:0%
transportation costs
 
06:26:42.708 --> 06:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
to to pick up each of those containers
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
separately and send them somewhere
 
06:26:48.708 --> 06:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
but that is a good way to to get to
 
06:26:51.270 --> 06:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know to get to this
 
06:26:53.030 --> 06:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we feel that there aren't
 
06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
facilities out there that are capable of
 
06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
of handling this
 
06:26:58.948 --> 06:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
you do have a couple of great there are
 
06:27:00.868 --> 06:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
a couple of great operators in the state
 
06:27:00.878 --> 06:27:02.150 align:start position:0%
a couple of great operators in the state
and

06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:03.990 --> 06:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
i know there have been others that have
 
06:27:04.000 --> 06:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
i know there have been others that have
pursued

06:27:05.190 --> 06:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
pursued
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
c d processing facilities in other parts
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
and their solid waste facility and they
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
run into certain amount number of
 
06:27:13.830 --> 06:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
challenges to get those permitted and
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
some have been unsuccessful in that so
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
to jump from
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
right to
 
06:27:22.708 --> 06:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
a prohibition
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
i feel is is is is premature that that's
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
06:27:29.270 --> 06:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's uh uh
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
you feel it's gonna result in a lot of
 
06:27:32.628 --> 06:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
extra cost in the industry and
 
06:27:34.468 --> 06:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
physically i'm not sure that it's it's
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
really not physically even required i
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
mean viable
 
06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned
 
06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
existing landfills do provide a
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
necessary outlet for these c d
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
processing facilities
 
06:27:46.080 --> 06:27:47.350 align:start position:0%
processing facilities
so

06:27:47.350 --> 06:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's one of those other products
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
i described
 
06:27:52.788 --> 06:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be
 
06:27:54.468 --> 06:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
certain products from facilities that
 
06:27:56.628 --> 06:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
recycle c d that are going to need an
 
06:27:59.030 --> 06:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
outlet a locally available
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
landfill outlet in my opinion
 
06:28:03.750 --> 06:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
and third the proposed penalties are
 
06:28:03.760 --> 06:28:05.910 align:start position:0%
and third the proposed penalties are
really

06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:28:08.390 --> 06:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
very very high for
 
06:28:10.468 --> 06:28:10.478 align:start position:0%
you know the relative type of penalty
 
06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the 20 250 to 2500
 
06:28:15.350 --> 06:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
25 000
 
06:28:18.468 --> 06:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
um you know their our industry would
 
06:28:20.788 --> 06:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
likely set up a way that we would
 
06:28:22.468 --> 06:28:22.478 align:start position:0%
inspect those materials and then pass
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that back to
 
06:28:25.830 --> 06:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
whoever brought that into
 
06:28:27.750 --> 06:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
our facility and that could be
 
06:28:29.670 --> 06:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
anybody from a large contractor to a
 
06:28:32.390 --> 06:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
small local contractor that brings in
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
the material we you know quote unquote
 
06:28:35.350 --> 06:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
catch them
 
06:28:37.430 --> 06:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
assess fines i mean i think that's a
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
that's uh there are other ways to kind
 
06:28:40.868 --> 06:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
of get there and i think that solid
 
06:28:42.708 --> 06:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
waste committee that's been
 
06:28:45.030 --> 06:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
put together
 
06:28:46.468 --> 06:28:46.478 align:start position:0%
this is something that i believe they're
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
taking a look at is how do we move the
 
06:28:50.310 --> 06:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
needle on on c and d processing as well
 
06:28:51.990 --> 06:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
as other materials
 
06:28:54.628 --> 06:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
and um jumping right to this like a
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
penalty based
 
06:28:58.708 --> 06:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
prohibition we feel is uh inappropriate
 
06:29:00.390 --> 06:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
at this time so
 
06:29:02.230 --> 06:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:29:03.910 --> 06:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
testify and if you have any questions
 
06:29:06.230 --> 06:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
for me
 
06:29:06.240 --> 06:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
for me
questions

06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
i see none thank you for your testimony
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.510 --> 06:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:39.030 --> 06:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
06:29:39.040 --> 06:29:40.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
committee

06:29:40.150 --> 06:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
my name is michael nork i represent the
 
06:29:44.230 --> 06:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste management bureau at the new
 
06:29:45.510 --> 06:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
 
06:29:45.520 --> 06:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
services

06:29:47.270 --> 06:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:29:52.070 --> 06:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
the department opposes hb 1544
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
and mr magnussen
 
06:29:56.548 --> 06:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
basically summarized a lot of the
 
06:29:59.910 --> 06:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
similar concerns that we have
 
06:30:01.590 --> 06:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
let me just back up for a second and
 
06:30:05.350 --> 06:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
explain that in new hampshire
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
generators of c d waste generally have
 
06:30:11.510 --> 06:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
two options
 
06:30:13.590 --> 06:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
they have the option of putting c d in a
 
06:30:13.600 --> 06:30:15.670 align:start position:0%
they have the option of putting c d in a
landfill

06:30:15.670 --> 06:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
06:30:15.680 --> 06:30:17.270 align:start position:0%
landfill
directly

06:30:17.270 --> 06:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
directly
 
06:30:19.750 --> 06:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
they have the option of putting c d
 
06:30:22.468 --> 06:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
through a processing facility as
 
06:30:24.468 --> 06:30:24.478 align:start position:0%
representative mcwilliams alluded to and
 
06:30:26.948 --> 06:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
also mr magnuson alluded to these
 
06:30:29.430 --> 06:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
facilities that process cnd
 
06:30:29.440 --> 06:30:30.868 align:start position:0%
facilities that process cnd
essentially

06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:30:33.430 --> 06:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
recover and recycle what they can and
 
06:30:35.670 --> 06:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of it goes to a landfill so
 
06:30:38.070 --> 06:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
even if cnd were to go to a processing
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
facility there's still a need for
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
disposal of
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
whatever remnants or residuals
 
06:30:49.350 --> 06:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:53.830 --> 06:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
and to be clear what hp 1544 would do
 
06:30:55.750 --> 06:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
would essentially create a zero
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
tolerance policy
 
06:30:57.680 --> 06:30:58.708 align:start position:0%
tolerance policy
for

06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:04.868 --> 06:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
this we see as a potential problem
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
because as mr magnuson alluded to
 
06:31:11.270 --> 06:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
there isn't an extensive network of cnd
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
processing facilities throughout the
 
06:31:15.430 --> 06:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
state currently there are a few a
 
06:31:15.440 --> 06:31:17.350 align:start position:0%
state currently there are a few a
handful

06:31:17.350 --> 06:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
handful
 
06:31:19.110 --> 06:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
and they do process a fair amount of c
 
06:31:21.030 --> 06:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
and d waste from new hampshire
 
06:31:23.830 --> 06:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
generators as well as from other states
 
06:31:26.310 --> 06:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh the problem is that even if we were
 
06:31:27.910 --> 06:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
to institute
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
a policy where c d couldn't go to a
 
06:31:34.868 --> 06:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
landfill it had to go to a c d processor
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
the c d processors aren't going to be
 
06:31:37.670 --> 06:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to
 
06:31:40.070 --> 06:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
recycle 100 percent of the waste
 
06:31:42.708 --> 06:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
as representative mcwilliams alluded to
 
06:31:45.430 --> 06:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has set a basic standard
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
to recycle 15 percent of c d basically
 
06:31:50.150 --> 06:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
the idea is
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
anyone who's generating c d in
 
06:31:51.760 --> 06:31:53.270 align:start position:0%
anyone who's generating c d in
massachusetts

06:31:53.270 --> 06:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
06:31:54.868 --> 06:31:54.878 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
06:31:56.948 --> 06:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
do what they can to recover at least
 
06:31:58.390 --> 06:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent
 
06:32:00.468 --> 06:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
before it goes to disposal
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
so even in massachusetts they're not
 
06:32:06.788 --> 06:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
banning c and d disposal outright
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
but they are doing things to try to
 
06:32:11.670 --> 06:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
encourage recycling of that material
 
06:32:13.350 --> 06:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
something like that potentially could be
 
06:32:14.708 --> 06:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
considered for new hampshire but an
 
06:32:17.030 --> 06:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
outright ban right now is just
 
06:32:18.628 --> 06:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
it's not feasible
 
06:32:20.468 --> 06:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that under our
 
06:32:22.150 --> 06:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
current infrastructure we would be able
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
to support in this state
 
06:32:26.868 --> 06:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
while the intention here is is obviously
 
06:32:28.150 --> 06:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
something that should be considered i
 
06:32:29.910 --> 06:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
think the the actual language of the
 
06:32:31.430 --> 06:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh is not workable and we we oppose that
 
06:32:34.320 --> 06:32:35.190 align:start position:0%
uh is not workable and we we oppose that
so

06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:32:37.590 --> 06:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
um with that i'll leave that uh that
 
06:32:37.600 --> 06:32:38.868 align:start position:0%
um with that i'll leave that uh that
will

06:32:38.868 --> 06:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:32:40.788 --> 06:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
i'll leave my comments there uh if you
 
06:32:43.270 --> 06:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
have any questions for me happy to
 
06:32:44.628 --> 06:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
take those
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions from mr norc
 
06:32:49.350 --> 06:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative simpson
 
06:32:51.030 --> 06:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:32:53.110 --> 06:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:32:53.120 --> 06:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:56.150 --> 06:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
so do you have a sense
 
06:32:56.160 --> 06:32:58.150 align:start position:0%
so do you have a sense
of

06:32:58.150 --> 06:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
if there's a percentage that
 
06:33:02.230 --> 06:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
we might
 
06:33:04.390 --> 06:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
talk about in new hampshire maybe
 
06:33:04.400 --> 06:33:06.070 align:start position:0%
talk about in new hampshire maybe
aspirationally

06:33:06.070 --> 06:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
aspirationally
 
06:33:08.708 --> 06:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
um that the department would think might
 
06:33:11.670 --> 06:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
be possible of how much we could
 
06:33:15.430 --> 06:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
aim to recycle of the c d
 
06:33:16.948 --> 06:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
thanks representative simpson for the
 
06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.510 --> 06:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
so my home committee is environment and
 
06:33:24.868 --> 06:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
agriculture they know some of the
 
06:33:26.310 --> 06:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
struggles that we have at the department
 
06:33:28.310 --> 06:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of data and
 
06:33:28.320 --> 06:33:29.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of data and
managing

06:33:29.910 --> 06:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
managing
 
06:33:32.548 --> 06:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
some of these issues
 
06:33:35.350 --> 06:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
what we did a couple years ago was we
 
06:33:38.230 --> 06:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:39.590 --> 06:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
surrounding states have done what's
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
known as a materials or a waste
 
06:33:43.030 --> 06:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
composition study
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
so that what they're doing is they're
 
06:33:46.070 --> 06:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
looking at how much waste is going to
 
06:33:49.030 --> 06:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
landfills and basically taking samples
 
06:33:50.708 --> 06:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out
 
06:33:52.390 --> 06:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
by you know categorizing the waste and
 
06:33:53.670 --> 06:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what could be
 
06:33:53.680 --> 06:33:54.788 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what could be
recycled

06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
recycled
 
06:33:56.468 --> 06:33:56.478 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we looked at some of
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
those recent waste characterization
 
06:34:00.310 --> 06:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
studies from surrounding states
 
06:34:02.708 --> 06:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
to kind of get an idea and
 
06:34:03.990 --> 06:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's not always going to be apples to
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
apples you know state by state but
 
06:34:08.948 --> 06:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
we did look at this and we looked at the
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
c d stream which is less understood than
 
06:34:13.110 --> 06:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
the municipal solid waste stream so
 
06:34:14.788 --> 06:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
there's less data
 
06:34:16.468 --> 06:34:16.478 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:34:19.350 --> 06:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
based on that analysis we figure
 
06:34:22.708 --> 06:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
roughly 15 of cnd right now is
 
06:34:22.718 --> 06:34:24.788 align:start position:0%
roughly 15 of cnd right now is
realistically

06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
06:34:26.628 --> 06:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
recyclable which is also in line with
 
06:34:28.310 --> 06:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
where massachusetts currently is and i
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
think massachusetts set that standard
 
06:34:30.000 --> 06:34:32.628 align:start position:0%
think massachusetts set that standard
because

06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
they had to start somewhere and
 
06:34:35.670 --> 06:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
obviously they want to build that up
 
06:34:38.628 --> 06:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
over time to recycle more and more as
 
06:34:40.230 --> 06:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
but a lot of it depends on what markets
 
06:34:42.310 --> 06:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
are available and what what outlets are
 
06:34:44.230 --> 06:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
feasibly available to recycle these
 
06:34:45.750 --> 06:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
materials that's really what when
 
06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
something is defined as recyclable it's
 
06:34:47.520 --> 06:34:48.390 align:start position:0%
something is defined as recyclable it's
really

06:34:48.390 --> 06:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:34:50.548 --> 06:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
it comes down to where it you know where
 
06:34:51.430 --> 06:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
you can
 
06:34:53.510 --> 06:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
take it or where you can
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know what you can do with it and
 
06:35:02.468 --> 06:35:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:06.230 --> 06:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:07.350 --> 06:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
06:35:09.430 --> 06:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a follow-up to that question and
 
06:35:11.190 --> 06:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:35:15.510 --> 06:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
does the department have in place a plan
 
06:35:20.230 --> 06:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
currently we don't have a stated
 
06:35:22.638 --> 06:35:23.670 align:start position:0%
currently we don't have a stated
plan

06:35:23.670 --> 06:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
plan
 
06:35:25.270 --> 06:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
this is something that i think we've
 
06:35:27.030 --> 06:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
talked about internally we don't
 
06:35:28.868 --> 06:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily have
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
a policy or
 
06:35:32.788 --> 06:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
part of our challenge is that our
 
06:35:36.628 --> 06:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
authority under rsa 149m
 
06:35:38.628 --> 06:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
is that we don't necessarily have
 
06:35:42.230 --> 06:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to make rules that would
 
06:35:45.030 --> 06:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
impose a ban on disposal or mandate
 
06:35:45.040 --> 06:35:46.948 align:start position:0%
impose a ban on disposal or mandate
recycling

06:35:46.948 --> 06:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
06:35:48.868 --> 06:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
so our ability to work within that space
 
06:35:52.150 --> 06:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
is a little bit tenuous but
 
06:35:53.910 --> 06:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
we are charged with
 
06:35:55.590 --> 06:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
updating a solid waste management plan
 
06:35:56.788 --> 06:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
and that might be a venue where we could
 
06:36:00.948 --> 06:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
explore possibilities
 
06:36:02.468 --> 06:36:02.478 align:start position:0%
it's not to say that we would be able to
 
06:36:04.868 --> 06:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
enact a broad policy that might need
 
06:36:04.878 --> 06:36:10.390 align:start position:0%
enact a broad policy that might need
legislation

06:36:10.390 --> 06:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:10.400 --> 06:36:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
any

06:36:11.350 --> 06:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:36:14.070 --> 06:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:36:15.430 --> 06:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
sigmund thank you for your testing thank
 
06:36:15.440 --> 06:36:17.110 align:start position:0%
sigmund thank you for your testing thank
you

06:36:17.110 --> 06:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:36:18.230 --> 06:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to
 
06:36:23.030 --> 06:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:25.350 --> 06:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
06:36:29.350 --> 06:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:31.750 --> 06:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think that concludes our business for
 
06:36:32.788 --> 06:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
the day
 
06:36:34.468 --> 06:36:34.478 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the committee members
 
06:36:36.070 --> 06:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
who hung in here all day long i
 
06:36:37.510 --> 06:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
06:36:37.520 --> 06:36:38.868 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
and

06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:40.868 --> 06:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
we will reconvene at nine o'clock
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
06:37:23.350 --> 06:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:25.590 --> 06:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
one of the most wonderful things
 
06:37:28.948 --> 06:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:31.350 --> 06:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
but really i mean i'm kind of
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
agreeing with what they have to say
 
06:37:35.190 --> 06:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't have any
 
06:37:35.200 --> 06:37:50.830 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't have any
recyclables

06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh yep
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's not one thing i think
 
06:38:46.548 --> 06:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:55.110 --> 06:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
