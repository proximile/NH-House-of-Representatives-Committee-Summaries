00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
like it when we start that way and would
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
you speak
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
to um what we're going to vote
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
on um as soon as I find
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.870 align:start position:0%
on um as soon as I find
it

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that it's very important for
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
us to realize that um in a a
 
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
very difficult situation such
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
as and I cannot find the bill I
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
apologize do you have it and an
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
annotated copy no less look at that huh
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
that really great he see he runs the
 
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester he does so he does
 
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
Lord but I I just believe that uh
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony is a necessity for
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
both men and
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
women um who
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
are unfortunately facing
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
divorce and one or the other is left
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
with little or no income so a temporary
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
alimony situation I think works really
 
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.230 align:start position:0%
alimony situation I think works really
well

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh and this bill will speak to that
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
and uh give those people who would
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise suffer Financial
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
travesties uh something to go
 
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
on so I would appreciate the support of
 
00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.749 align:start position:0%
on so I would appreciate the support of
the

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
committee anyone
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman um as I
 
00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
recall we've had temporary Al want for
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
some time what this bill does I believe
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
is direct you to direct the uh Court to
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
utilize the formula which I'm not that
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with it came in during during
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
my two times here yeah could you can you
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit about the uh
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
formula I'm not very well versed on the
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
formula however the reason that uh we
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh get involved with the
 
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
formula is because it creates
 
00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 align:start position:0%
consistency in the court it gives uh the
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
the court the opportunity to say to
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
all uh people who come before them this
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
is the this is the formula this is what
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to give you this is what
 
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to give you this is what
we'll

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%

not present and there was some
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
department has on its website currently
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
are two technical advisories that were
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
issued in response to the legislative
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
changes that were made last session the
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
first one was made just based on the two
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
bills bills that were passed the Senate
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the corresponding House Bill
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the second technical advisory was issued
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
based upon questions that we were
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
receiving from the field some points of
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
clarification as to the interpretation
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
of the new laws um and then most
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
recently in working with the Department
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services as we were
 
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519 align:start position:0%
required to do by law we have issued the
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion form that is a
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
fillable PDF that is available on our
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
website and we have sent that out to the
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
field and as I always say um nothing
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
that I ever produce will be perfect I
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
wish I could say it would be but we are
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
open to suggestions and feedback from
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
the field it is really a working
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
document so we're getting feedback and
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
and trying to address any of concerns
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
that that we're hearing um so I just
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that for this
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
committee I'm happy to answer any
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for any
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
questions for tney Fenton of clarifying
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
nature representative long you have a
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
tell you know I know when you're going
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
to want a question you have a tell I'll
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
explain it later thank you Mr chairman
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for the opportunity uh
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns is uh prior to the
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
use uh of constraints
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
uh immediately after seclusion
 
00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
uh immediately after seclusion
or

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.870 align:start position:0%
or
uh

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
as soon as on line 32 22 actually as
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
soon as
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
practical um my my issue is with
 
00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:42.430 align:start position:0%
practical um my my issue is with
other

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
children uh in the classroom and and
 
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.110 align:start position:0%
children uh in the classroom and and
being

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
identified um is that's somewhat of a
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
goe I think the short answer is is yes
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the video being released
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
that's the bigger concern um we deal
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
with those concerns on a somewhat
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
regular basis if you recognize that
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of uh recording devices
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
in hallways not NE not in classrooms but
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the hallways that if there is an
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
incident at a school in a hallway then
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
there presumably would be other children
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh videotaped and so what the schools
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
will typically do and I can't speak for
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
every school obviously but typically
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
they will blur other children's faces or
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
make it so that the only focus is on the
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
particular child or the particular
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
incident whatever the situation might be
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
so there are ways to address that
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
concern um I also think that if you
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
think about when restraint and seclusion
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
occur restraint and seclusion and and I
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
by no means am an expert I am a lawyer
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
I'm not from the field I'll be always
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
the first one to to acknowledge that but
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
I have become somewhat of an expert in
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
just working with the field on this very
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
complicated topic and what the field
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
will tell you and I think it's so
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
important for this committee to hear
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
from the field on this topic in
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
particular it's a challenging area for
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
educators it really is some of the
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
behaviors they are seeing are very very
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
complex and and challenging um this is
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
not a tool that they like to use it's
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
not a tool that they use on the regular
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
basis but it is a tool to control
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
dangerous escalating
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
behavior and typically it is used once
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
the child has already been removed they
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
utilize therapeutic intervention and the
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
statute speaks to that it doesn't Define
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
that term but it speaks to therapeutic
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
intervention um and
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
so could other children be caught on
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
camera if when videotaping it yes they
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
could could that's the reality of it but
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
typically the child has already been
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
removed to a different area a separate
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
area not necessarily secluded but
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
removed from that that area where the
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
issue is already occurring so I think it
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
is a smaller likelihood than having
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
cameras in the hallway but again my
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
caveat to my testimony is that the
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
people that really know the ins and outs
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
of restraint and seclusion are the
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
amazing Educators who have who are
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
tasked with doing it every
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
day I get thank you Mr chairman uh we
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
did hear from uh Mr
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg um
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
who uh who stated that it needed work uh
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
particularly with students with special
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
needs and IEPs um because it's emergency
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
only that this will take
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
effect um and and she was concerned
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
about even their ident
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
identity uh you know being out to uh you
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
know to parents who wish to see the
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
recording uh well the parents wouldn't
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
be an issue they already know that uh
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
but those that wouldn't know um that a
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
person with special needs or had an
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.230 align:start position:0%
 
problematic

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify your question are you
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
talking about identifying a child who
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
has an IEP or special needs yeah um yes
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
it could it could be problematic anytime
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
you release that information document
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
that information absolutely okay yes one
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
more for I one more uh I mean it it
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
appeared to me that this was a marac
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
issue I get that I I did I'm from
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I asked my district and
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
there uh the the testimony we heard uh
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
my my district didn't have those issues
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
I know somebody testified that there
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
were five people standing at an open
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
seclusion door with the child inside I
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
know you need you you need to get a
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
trusted adult for that child whomever
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
that may be whether it's a coach whether
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's somebody not in the schools so we
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
heard a testimony that that wasn't
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
happening um and and that that was part
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill um because that wasn't
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
happening uh which is already in
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
statute um so I do you see this
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
state and to clarify do I see the need
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes I I can't say that I see the need
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
for it um my observations and and again
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
it really is just my
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
observations this is a challenging area
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
law um I think school districts and
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
special education teachers are
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
struggling to fully comprehend what last
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
year's legislative changes mean I think
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
it is important to recognize that this
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
is used in an emergency
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
situation these tools and they are tools
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion are tools I
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't know of a single educator who
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
looks forward to interacting with a
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
child in this capacity
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
um they are highly trained individuals
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
and I know that a lot the schools put a
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
lot of time and effort and resources
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
into ensuring that this is done properly
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
and in accordance with the law and it's
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
only done in those emergency
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
situations what I've heard from the
 
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.350 align:start position:0%
situations what I've heard from the
field

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
is they're struggling they're struggling
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
with the changes that were made last
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
year of fully understanding how to
 
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
implement them of understanding how this
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
is information is being utilized um
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
again um it's it's a challenging area of
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
the law they want to make sure that they
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
are giving the child what they need to
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that the child is safe and the
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
people around them are safe and at the
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
same time they are so self-aware and and
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
conscientious not to to violate the law
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and so it really is I think a very
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
delicate balancing act very good thank
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
you repres resentative
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you uh Mr chairman for
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask a question and thank
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
you for your for coming in today do you
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
feel that this will help reduce the
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um against the teachers or
 
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.950 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um against the teachers or
maybe

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
another administrator in the school
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
videos

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of of any lawsuits that
 
00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:04.350 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of of any lawsuits that
are

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
occurring um I'm sure they are I'm just
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
not aware of any so I don't know if I'm
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
in a position to say whether it would
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
reduce them or or increase them I I
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
um I think your question is probably
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
better targeted
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
to the educ ators who engage in this
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
work directly I would hesitate to go any
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
further in my testimony that I already
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
have because I'm again I'm not from the
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
field um and I've never re I've never
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
engaged in Restraint or seclusion of a
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
child and so when I train in this area
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
when I work with the field in this area
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
I'm always the first to admit my my
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
deficiencies that this is not an area
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
that I that I work with the irony is my
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
mom was a special educator who did do
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
this work um but I haven't had that
 
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.909 align:start position:0%
this work um but I haven't had that
personal

00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
experience um uh I I go back to my prior
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
testimony this is an area that educators
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
are very well trained in but it's hard
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
it's a hard area and you're always
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
trying to maintain that delicate balance
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
of of having to react in an emergency
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
situation and I again use that word for
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
a purpose it is an emergency situation
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
to use these tools to calm down a child
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
who is escalating to the point of
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
causing harm to themselves or others and
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
and not wanting their work to be Monday
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
morning quarterbacked for lack of a
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
better term or second guest um I think
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing from the field I
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
know that doesn't directly answer your
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
question and I apologize for that I
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
think it's the best I can
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
do thank
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
question um attorney Fenton um we got a
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
number of emails from parents parents
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
who wanted to know about their rights to
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
opt out of this kind of surveillance um
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
so parents who are concerned that um
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
schools might be you know if if this
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
passes if they were um videotaping their
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
students that schools would be using it
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
to make a case on you know sending kids
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
out of their their local District or um
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
or or uh families who felt that um this
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
might be a scary and uncomfortable thing
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
for their kids and so my question is
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
what do we have that protects a parent's
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
right to opt out because currently we
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
have opt outs in law for like
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
photography and other things is there
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
anything in law that would protect those
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
parents who don't want their children to
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
be subjected to this type of
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
interesting and while you're looking
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
that up there would not be such a right
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
for the video in the hall suddenly to
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
shut off when that child walks by and
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
shut back and turn back on when the
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
child is passed would there be which is
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
a ridiculous question I know the answer
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
no I I do really well with ridiculous
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions just so you know so um you
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
come to the right
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
place well you're asking the right
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer um the answer is no and I'm
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
certainly not aware of anything like
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
that the opt out provision that I'm very
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
familiar with is in
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.310 align:start position:0%
familiar with is in
186

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
186
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
18611 Roman
 
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
18611 Roman
numeral

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
9d and that deals with non-academic
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
surveys being provided to Children um
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
and there's that opt out provision so
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
certainly this committee could look at
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
at that as some potential guidance um
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
different however AER survey given in a
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
calm environment
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
versus videotaping in again an emergency
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
situation but I think that the language
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
in the law I did hear some murmuring
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
after your
 
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.190 align:start position:0%
after your
question

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
um it's already in that
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
IEP plan presumably
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and the parent can agree to that or
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
not agree to that uh I think it's
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that even
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
children who don't have an IP can some
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
times have restraint and seclusion
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
applied it's not just limited to a
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
certain um population so it might not be
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
addressed in every
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
instance representative
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this is um
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually further to that section okay so
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
um what I'm reading is as soon as
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
practicable pursuant to RSA 189 colon 68
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
blah blah each use of seclusion shall be
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
visually and auditorally recorded if
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
such method of recording is included in
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
the students individualized education
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
program or accommodation plan my
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
legally um if this is um part of a
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
child's IEP it's an emergency situation
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
therefore there might be an occasion
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
where videoing
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
where videoing
is

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
not practical or or not happening for
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
whatever reason would that set the
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
school district up for a lawsuit
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
because that
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
um was not session of restraining um for
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
lack of better terms sorry um was not
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
recorded in an emergency situation thank
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
you for answer my question uh thank you
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
for the question so you're right if it's
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
um could could a family could a parent
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
or Guardian file a a grievance yes could
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
they file a lawsuit potentially um
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't see what the remedy
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
would be for a violation in the law and
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something this
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
committee could take into a
 
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.310 align:start position:0%
committee could take into a
consideration

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
um but yes the way it's written is as
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
soon as practicable um each use of
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
seclusion shall be video visually and
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
auditorally recorded if included in that
 
00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:39.430 align:start position:0%
auditorally recorded if included in that
plan

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
yep representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um the way I'm
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
understanding this is there's an IEP and
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
an accommodation plan in or which I'm
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
not familiar with what accommodation
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
plan is by the way but if it's put in
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
there I assume it's put in by the parent
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
in the accommodation or
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
IEP would that be correct so uh thank
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
you for your question let me answer the
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
first part the accommodation so the
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
accommodation is is called a 504
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
accommodation and a 504 accommodation
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
can be for a variety of things it can be
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um if you need additional time to take a
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
test it can be if you need um to be in
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
acquired area to to take a test um I
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
will share with you on a personal note
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
my son has scoliosis he has a back brace
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
and so he has a 504 accommodation plan
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
that allows him to leave the classroom
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
early to go to the nurse's office to
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
take that off whatever the case may be
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
um it's not an IP it's an accommodation
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
and you'll find a wide variety of
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
accommodations going back to the I AP
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
question the I is created with a team
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
and the team includes the parent parent
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
voice Guardian voice is very important
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
part of that school district um special
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
education teacher regular education
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
teacher it is a team of people who
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
create this
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
IEP on you know in the best of
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances everyone is in agreement
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
however we have seen at the department
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
um that sometimes there is there is
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
disagreement between those team members
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
as to what is best for that student so
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
there can be those disagreements there
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
can be partial consent there can be no
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
consent to an IP um but in a perfect
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
situation the IP is agreed to by the
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
parent and that would of course include
 
00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.310 align:start position:0%
parent and that would of course include
this

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
language okay so it is voluntary then
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah yeah voluntary in what
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
sense uh the that the parents have
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
agreed to have cameras I mean this what
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is all about having during the
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
during the uh that would be part of the
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
I the IEP meeting it wouldn't be written
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
down in the IEP and the parent would be
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
able to review that and and then sign
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
off on it agree to it yes okay and if
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
they didn't agree to it they don't have
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
to agree to that portion of it right it
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
could be signed in what they call
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
partial consent
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I think that helps me thank
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
you you're
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you thank you very much
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
time I'd like to call Representative Tim
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
once again this is not testimony this is
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
not a hearing but because of any um
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
needs for clarification I would like to
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
call the uh Prime sponsor of the bill to
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
do just that not to re
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
um redo a hearing but to clarify a few
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
things that I've heard all kinds of
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
different answers to the same question
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman nice to see you
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
all again appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
clarify a few things first let me just
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
start out by saying that anyone can sue
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
anyone for any reason I think we know
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
that parents sue the schools parents Sue
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
other parents parents sue the
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
state this bill aims to reduce that in a
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
tiny fashion or at least make those
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.710 align:start position:0%
types of
claims

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
obviously correct or incorrect or answer
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
some of the unanswered questions that we
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
may see in the
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
subjective or long or delayed report
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
writing I mean how many times have you
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
have people here and in a little fender
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
bender and the guy says well I had the
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
right away and you claim you had the
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
right away and you know you just wish
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
there was a traffic camera there to
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
prove exactly what happened because it
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
would put all of that discussion
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
immediately to bed it's why we have body
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
cameras it's why we have surveillance in
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
schools now it's why the governor and
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
Council approved $9.8 million
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
specifically for surveillance and access
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
control it's why in the city of nashwa
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to receive in the city of
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
Nashville they're going to receive
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
$170,000 specifically for surveillance
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
right schools are on board with this
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
they know it breeds transparency they
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
know it's for the children for the
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
students and for the teachers they know
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
that debunking he said she said is the
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
easiest way to put a stop to
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
it representative long
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
1,434 cases is not an isolated marac
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
issue that's a Statewide issue and it's
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
too often and if you think for one
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
minute it doesn't happen for what cases
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
of restraint and seclusion reported in
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
the last full reporting year it was also
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
from my original testimony but
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative long you commented it's a
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
marac issue 1,434 cases of restraints
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
inclusion and seclusion is a Statewide
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue you full disclosure I mentioned
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
before and so did other testifiers they
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in some of those cases
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's a multiple multiple uh student you
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
know a single student with multiple
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
cases so individual cases is probably
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
something somewhat less than
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
1,434 but let's cut it in half let's cut
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
it in a third let's divide it by five
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
and it's still too many if you ask me
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
and there's still too many unanswered
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
questions and if you think for a second
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen in the Manchester
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
school system ask you to wrap it up now
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
because it's becoming a rearing of the
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
testimony agreed so people act
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
differently when there's a recording
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
this will protect our most vulnerable
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
children um we have a lot of privacy
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
protections that's an issue that come up
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
several times um we have a lot of
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
privacy protections we have
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh we have Hippa which doesn't generally
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
apply here because it's a health health
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh Health protection and portability act
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
so Hippa doesn't generally apply
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
although we've heard that sometimes it
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
does some some claims that it does but
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you emphatically it does not
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully that answers a few of
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
the questions about how widespread the
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
problem is and how this aims to take a
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
small step to reduce lawsuits reduce
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and protect the kids and the
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
teachers equally
 
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.509 align:start position:0%
teachers equally
representative

00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
you did cite um a tremendous amount of
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
incidents happening in marac and
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so is there an
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
implication that when a video is there
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
those incidences will be reduced thus
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
implying that there's abuse going
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
on and the reason why I ask that is
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
because I'm wondering if the real issue
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
isn't that of professional training so
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
that the staff knows how to manage these
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
children appropriately because just
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
having a video and seeing what goes on
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve the underlining problem so
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
either there is deliberate abuse going
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
on and we want to catch these
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
perpetrators or we are acknowledging
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
that staff is woefully unprepared to
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
deal with these children that's an
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
excellent question in a word no uh the
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
best use the best training tool you have
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
is video think about how every sports
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
team gets better they measure what they
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to improve they observe what they
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
want to improve and the first thing you
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
do after game Days review the game f
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
game film to prepare for the next game
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
right it everybody knows that video is
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
an excellent teaching tool for one so in
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
a in a word though answer a question do
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
I expect that the incidents of
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusion will
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically drop not necessarily I
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
think there's a number of issues uh
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
mainstreaming of mainstreaming of kids
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
creation of ips there's a whole host of
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
issues this is a small step to increase
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
transparency and to learn from the
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
issues and learn from the incidents that
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
are currently happening and hopefully
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
make them less and make what happened
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
more clear to all parties to the
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent to the school board to
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
other parents right and to the parents
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the children who are secluded and
 
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.309 align:start position:0%
of the children who are secluded and
restrained

00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
restrained
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
go representative long thank you Mr
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for the
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity um I I realize how many um
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
seclusions there are um however uh when
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
I spoke to the manchesters district um
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
although they are still struggling with
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
what was passed last year we heard
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of uh for example I mentioned
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
to the attorney the uh there was a door
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
open five people there so the trusted ad
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
doubt I'm assuming must be difficult um
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I certainly respect the fact that
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
you believe that a film will reduce I
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
don't uh people that are doing uh harm
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh a film a film doesn't get them to not
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
do harm they lose their job that's how
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do harm um so I I I
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe I I I tend to lean toward
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
towards uh Miss
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg uh when she says that it needs
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
work I I believe that it does need work
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
and um you know that it's an emergency
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
only um incidents that we we're now
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
going to be filming um I think that
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
makes it more complicated for uh well I
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
know it makes it more complicated for
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
the Manchester District on on getting
 
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.470 align:start position:0%
the Manchester District on on getting
that

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
um so I I I don't agree I see where you
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
agree that it's going to reduce some I
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't agree that it will reduce some I
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
think it'll be more complicated and I
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
think will bring more uh more suits in
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the reporting year uh that we looked
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
at the most recent complete year uh
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester wasn't in the top five nor
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
was marac uh the top five were were
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
different different schools that I named
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
previously I could go back but I won't
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
repeat them so uh
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
I mean perhaps we do disagree on whether
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
video is a useful tool but I think what
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
we can agree on you mentioned it
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
yourself harm we can agree that harm
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
reduction is a good thing and reducing
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
one two five 100 500 cases or at least
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
making it more clear what happened is a
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
good thing so for the sake of harm
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
reduction for the sake of protecting the
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
children and the students the students
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
who are the children and the parents and
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
the teachers everybody knows what
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
happened why not be transparent the
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
state just issued $9.8 million of Grants
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
to help fund this uh representative as
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
as I was going all through this and the
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
question of vindication came up my mind
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
went to Vindication of teachers I have
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
Educators in my big family and sometimes
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
they get accused of harming Little Billy
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
when they were trying to calm him down
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
or force him not to hit other others and
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
I would think that any good teacher who
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
does the best he or she can which in an
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
emergency is the best one can do at the
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
time might welcome being videoed to
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate this kid was wild and I was
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent gross harm to others
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
and so therefore this is what I did and
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
when the kid said no you didn't look at
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
the tape it was one of the first thank
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for those comments it
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
was one of the first cas is that when we
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
started investigating we I mean some of
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the other Representatives representative
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
Mooney who was an attorney and I uh met
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
with some other other people outside of
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the initial constituent group as we were
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
doing research to find out where to
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
place this in statute how to couple it
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
with the existing statute and what was
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
passed last session one of the first
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
stories we got was thank goodness we had
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
video because the student told his
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
parents that he had been jostled around
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
or thrown into I think it was thrown
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
into a wall uh and they reviewed the
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
hallway videotape in this case it was
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
hallway videotape and thank God they had
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
it those teachers were immediately
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
exonerated there was no lawsuit and they
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
most certainly would have been in my if
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
I were that parent and firmly believed
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
that my kid had been assaulted I
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
probably would have thought about a
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
legal action but that immediately
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
squashed it they looked at it and the
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
child have been LED peacefully down the
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
hall and I'm going to ask the members of
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
the committee who are thinking of asking
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
questions please limit questions to
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
specific technical things where we need
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
clarification otherwise we're going to
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a hearing and we're not supposed to
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative pinho thank you Mr
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative I was
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you'd deop to the idea
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
of interim study and the reason why I
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
asked that is because um maren Tracy uh
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
who did testify one of the marac parents
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
who came forth I was looking at an email
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
exchange that she had with some of our
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee members and she took the uh
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
current bill as proposed and side by
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
side she offered uh suggested amendments
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
which in my opinion enhanced the bill I
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
mean personally I want the parents to
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
know that we hear their
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
concerns just don't think that this
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
particular Bill addresses it so I'm
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can work to improve it
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
and interim study might be the best way
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
to go so thank you for the suggestion um
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
Moran Tracy Mrs Tracy is is behind us
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
here and I think she looks like she has
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
another constituent with her too I'm not
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
so I I did take a look at those
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions those were suggestions that
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
she put together by rewatching some of
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
the testimony is my understanding and
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
she can speak for herself um but the
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
Bill's ready to go as an initial step a
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
as it is I mean the nice thing about our
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
rsas is they're constantly in interim
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
study every RSA is in constant scrutiny
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
review that's what we do here right last
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
year we passed two bills on this same
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
subject we could have inter studied
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
those until we could find a way to put
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
them both together or put them together
 
00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
with this issue I'd say let's take this
 
00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
with this issue I'd say let's take this
step

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
now and sure continue to study it the
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
chairman may wish to form an ad hoc
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee and continue to study and see
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
how it could even be expanded the one
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
opposition from Karen Rosenberg she said
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't go far enough she wants
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
cameras in every classroom and we've
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
heard that uh from a few people you know
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
let's put them in every single special
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
classroom let's get back to segregating
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
those students with IEPs or the special
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
needs students um those are all issues
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
for discussion but for now this is a
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
limited initial step so I think for what
 
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
it is on the face of it it's very well
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
thought out in terms of its positioning
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion with legal
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
experts and um and seus how this would
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
fit in their policy uh is it workable um
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
and then $9.8 million in funding showed
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
up not all for surveillance and some of
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
its access control and other things but
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh but huge number of it is it's like
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
three 400 schools that got these fully
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
funded grants without objection I would
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
like to call the question because if the
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor fails we can have
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
another motion I'm not asking you to
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
vote against my motion but I'm just
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
saying this is how it works thank you so
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
much just a clarification yeah go ahead
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
I may yeah please uh the 9.8 million is
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
not for um restraint and seclusion
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
surveillance correct it's for
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
surveillance um so it's not for it's not
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
for restraint and seclusion I wanted to
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
be clear on that it it wasn't meant for
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion no it's meant
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
for surveillance but surveillance audio
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
visual surveillance can absolutely
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
include those seclusion rooms so in just
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
in just to clarify so there's
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
no difficulty um not all 9.8 million was
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
designated specifically for surveillance
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
programs it's about 50/50 as I went
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
through the four-page list um and
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester is not on it by the way um I
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why they didn't apply for
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
some of those grants um you did you did
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
just didn't get them so you maybe weight
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
listed okay so some it's about 5050 like
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
it'll be 80 80,000 or 50,000 for
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance and then another 50,000 for
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
Access Control you know key card systems
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
thing so it it's split up um it's
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
there's definitely some question of
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
whether you could use either money to
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
cover access Andor surveillance of a
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
seclusion room I I certainly think you
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
could but um anyhow but that the money
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
is specifically designated for
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance and access control uh and I
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
think there was one other type of
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
electronic records maybe or something
 
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.309 align:start position:0%
electronic records maybe or something
pie

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
pie
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
it is this specifically a clarification
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
question because I would like to move on
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
this as soon as I can all right
 
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
this as soon as I can all right
representative

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
eimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
refer in uh section two as soon as
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
18968 each use of
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
seclusion if I go to um RSA
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
18968 it specifically States
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
um no school shall inst install remote
 
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.670 align:start position:0%
um no school shall inst install remote
surveillance

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
software on a school supplied Computing
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
device so how are we going to be keeping
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
these records uh so the Computing device
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
in my interpretation is is is different
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
right it's surveillance it's like
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring what websites you're going to
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that that's how I would
 
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
and things like that that's how I would
understand

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
that uh I mean that's how I read it a
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
school supplied Computing device right
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
surveillance software it's bigger than
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
just putting cameras on
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
kids representative um Nelson thank you
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I also reluctantly said
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
yes um I agree with um representative
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
Greg I agree with representative Patrina
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
representative long I would like us to
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
take a look at if this is a training and
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
accountability issue I think that it
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for us to um reach out
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
people who are experts in this
 
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.030 align:start position:0%
people who are experts in this
field

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
um to get a better idea of how we can
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
help these kids thank
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
you before I call on anybody else would
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who is much more learned in
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
these things Define for us how an
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
interim study actually
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
works while why the chair recognizes
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Adams could you come up and
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
works yes of course so um folks will
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
plan to get together usually around
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
October um and then the committee can
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
meet as many times as they need to and I
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe I believe that the um the
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
deadline is the end of October November
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
1 I believe is is the the deadline um
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it's noticed in the calendar it's a
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
meeting of the committee correct and you
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
produce a statement of your findings and
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of the outcome because it
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
will be a new
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
bium you can recommend for further
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
legislation if you wish however
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of the recommendation anyone
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
is fre to do whatever they like in the
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
upcoming session but I do find these to
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
be helpful when these bills come up
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
later again because you can look at the
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
verbage and what was done in the um the
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
statement thank
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
you please for
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
um Miss Dyer
 
00:48:06.359 --> 00:48:07.870 align:start position:0%
um Miss Dyer
yes

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh because uh next year
 
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
will be uh a new year and possibly some
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
people will not be coming back isn't it
 
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
true that um legislation can be

able to introduce legislation that uh
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
study thank
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%

patrino I just wanted to make thank you
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I wanted to make one final
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
point in the uh email exchanges that we
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
had with some of the folks um who
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
weren't happy with this legisl as
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
proposed um it was mentioned that the
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
state of Maine recently had a similar U
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
situation and a bill was passed which
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
they felt was Superior to what was
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
proposed um they mentioned that uh
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
experts in child uh care uh were
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
consulted in drafting that legislation
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
they saw the main uh now law to be
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
superior and I for one would like to
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
take a look and see what Maine did and
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
they may it may they may actually uh
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
answer some of our questions this could
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
researcher yes representative ball I
 
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.630 align:start position:0%
researcher yes representative ball I
hear

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
the no thank you chairman pearon doing
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
and thank you my representative next to
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
me patrino for bringing that up about
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
the main law I would be very interested
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
in also finding out what is in that um
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
in that law that makes it Superior my
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
hope is that it may include cameras that
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
monitor all the classrooms within the
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
classroom within any special programs
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
and within any any um places where the
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
children calm down areas wherever they
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
go for that um and my reason for really
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
wanting that as opposed to just
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
individual cameras on teachers or
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
something is again I go back to that
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
antecedent and I would just like to say
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
that when these things happen in the
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
general education in classroom there is
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
a negative impact on the other students
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the classroom who witness the
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
behaviors those children can end up
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
being left emotionally scarred
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
themselves from seeing how a child um
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
may be acting out or how um they are
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
dealt with by the teacher um this goes
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
beyond just the one student that one
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
special education student it impacts
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
every student who is within the vicinity
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the incident thank you if I know that
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
we are concerned for the children
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
children and if I know that we are
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
advocating for the children would I not
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
ask somebody from the office of the
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
child advocate to come on up and say
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
huh I actually just wanted to offer a
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
resource um to what representative
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
petrigno said there is an organization
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
based in Maine called lives in the
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
balance say it again lives in the
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
balance Dr Ross Green who is an expert
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
specifically in school restraint and
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
seclusion as well as offers an alternate
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
type of training we work closely with
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
him we're actually planning on screening
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
his movie in the fall and doing a panel
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
with his organization um they were
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
instrumental in passing that main law so
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to connect whoever wants to
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
with that organization Ben Johnson is
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
their legislative person's name I think
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
he's actually sent me a copy of that
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
bill um but they would be a really great
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
resource for your interim study group
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
since uh we're
 
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:03.559 align:start position:0%
called children and family law could we
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
come to the showing we would absolutely
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
plan to invite all of you and perhaps
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
even have someone speak on the panel
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
Nami hopefully will be on the panel um
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
but we all in our office watched that
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
movie in the spring and had no last fall
 
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
maybe um it's called the kids we lose
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's a phenomenal documentary about this
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
as do
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
um Mr Marquel and I who authored the
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%

00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
situation in divorce proceedings where

00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
constantly in contempt and there's very
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
little going on in the courts that the
 
00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:03.029 align:start position:0%
little going on in the courts that the
judges

00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
have guidance from the legislature and
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
this Pro provides that so uh I I'd
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
really like to have this
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%

question so having skimmed this fairly
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
quickly um can you correct me if I'm
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
wrong it looks to me like the big change
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that it it it makes it so the
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees shall be awarded the
 
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
judge won't have the option on that but
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
the rest of it is still up to judges
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%

representative
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
Bickford was it uh Jennifer Sergeant's
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
idea to take away discretion from the
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
judge on the
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh attorney
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
fees was it shall reward reasonable yeah
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
attorney fees to the prevailing
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
body doesn't really take the discretion
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
away it just gives them the opportunity
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
to specifically say yes we
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
shall says shall award reasonable
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
cost see under the section in which the
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
party alleges the court finds that a
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
party is in contempt or of court and has
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
failed without just cause to obey an
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
order of decree the court shall award
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable cause and trity fees which is
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
quite a change in what I think that's
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
probably what representative Raymond was
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
referring to as a loss of discretion
 
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.510 align:start position:0%
referring to as a loss of discretion
there

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
well there has to
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
be some
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
teeth to the
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
punishment of somebody who is being held
 
01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:18.349 align:start position:0%
punishment of somebody who is being held
in

01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
contempt well it's a matter of and
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a matter of the judge's
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
discretion is what's missing is taken
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
away way here it's not a matter of
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
there I just wanted with where the idea
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
came from to take away the discretion
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
from the judge we didn't see that as
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
taking discretion away we gave it we see
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
it as giving um the judge the
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
extra availability uh the judge can
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
always make a rule against that or a
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
portion thereof they shall award
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
something it does say something it says
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
attorney fees shall award yeah but the
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
fudge factor is the word reasonable
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable that gives It Wide Open from
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
for what the judge deems to be
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable which could be you know yeah
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
it just generally you see it as May to
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
reasonable and there are reasons for
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
doing one way or the other wayse shall
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
do reasonable um which means they could
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
award $5 they could award the entire
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
amount so we're not taking full
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
discretion away $5 would be
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
challengeable as a attorney fee I I get
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
just representative patrino thank you Mr
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just wondering if
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
incarceration of a parent is in the best
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
interest of the
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
child I just wanted some thoughts on
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
that matter it just seems kind of
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
excessive in my
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
it depends upon whether the contempt
 
01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:58.950 align:start position:0%
it depends upon whether the contempt
yeah

01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
situation warrants incarceration if you
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
have a domestic violence situation and
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
is uh in contempt of that DV
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
order it these issues are never in the
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child but we have
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
to keep the children saved and if this
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
is a domestic violence order which a
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
contempt order would warrant
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration then it unfortunately is
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the children and
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
parent follow up uh thank you I hear
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
again the way I'm looking at this this
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
would apply to any violation of the um
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
say the the parenting plan and it could
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
be something something rather simple
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
um and again I see incarceration there
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
and it just seems to be like something
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
that would be permitted in all
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances regardless of how severe
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
it would be and um I don't know I just
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable with that there I
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
mean clearly incarceration is
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate if there's domestic violence
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
but in other matters not so and again
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
knowing that your your father or your
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
mother's being taken away to jail
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't get along with the
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
other par for whatever reason to me it
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
would be very traumatic on on the child
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's just my thoughts well I think in
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
that case the it would be the judge's
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
discretion I don't see a judge putting
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in jail just because they don't
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
get along
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
with their ex uh it would have to be a
 
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
with their ex uh it would have to be a
jailable

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
offense I I don't see a judge reading
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
this as the sentence stopping at the
 
01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
this as the sentence stopping at the
word

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration I see it starting with
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
included but not limited to and
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
continuing on with fines and
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursements I don't see any judge
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
just seeing the word incarceration one
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
size fits all I think it's the sharpest
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox almost never to be
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
used and in the example given probably
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
should be and would be in the interest
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
child anyone else representative Nelson
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that a little bit and I um
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
understand where representative Petrino
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
was coming from I personally um had been
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
involved in a situation where the
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
children were um
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
the one of the parents was
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
intentionally um kidnapping the children
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and that happened several times and
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
the judge actually
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
um told that parent that if they if they
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
took the
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
children again um away from the other
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
parent during that parents parenting
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
disappeared without permission for
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
taking them out of state that that
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
parent would be incarcerated and I think
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is used as a deterrent I
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
think that is not in the best interest
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
of the children to be kidnapped away
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
from their other parents so that was
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
just something else I wanted to add to
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
you representative ball thank you
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and thank you
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson I agree with you
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
um this um Amendment does go on to say
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
that it would have to be a history of
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so it wouldn't just be
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
this person did something once and maybe
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't so bad then they're not going
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
to um be subject to an incarceration but
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
if they're seeing a history of every
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
time the parent gets the child they're
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
taking the child out of state or
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or not returning the
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
child then they are clearly
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrating a total disregard not just
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
for the par parenting plan but a
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
disregard to New Hampshire
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
you representative D Simon thank you Mr
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you all for your
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
comments because that is the exact
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
intent of the
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill we hear testimony
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
parents ex spouses about this type of
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
action something has to be done to Cease
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
the action of these people who feel well
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's no consequences in a court of
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
law so I'm just not going to follow what
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
the judge tells me to do there's no
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
consequence there's no severe
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
consequence so what's the big deal I
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
just will do was I please and that was
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill in the first
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
place in the uh special committee on the
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
Family Division of the circuit Court's
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
hearings I think we had 14 hours of
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
testimony from the public uh this came
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
up again and again and
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
again the judge said the other person
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
didn't nothing
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
happened representative patrino thank
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Mr chairman I just
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank you for your comments
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
that clarified uh my previous question
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
is given me uh some uh pause uh to think
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
and possibly reconsider not unless uh
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
other um points are U are brought forth
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you sir but thank you I
 
01:08:40.759 --> 01:08:42.349 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you sir but thank you I
appreciate

01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
it representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
chairman wasn't this bill introduced
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
because um it was in case law already
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
and it's just a matter put it into the
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
statutes and does that still follow
 
01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:01.430 align:start position:0%
statutes and does that still follow
through

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
now yes it's to bring it over to the um
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
Family statutes so that it gives more
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
clarity to the family court
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
judges but the if I may the the
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
amendment does not change that does
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
it no okay that's the answer I'm looking
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
if I could yeah uh yeah I mean we are
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
Quasi addressing this uh we have a uh
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill on a regular calendar
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh on uh enforcement of
 
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.110 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh on uh enforcement of
parenting

01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
plants um so I I you know I I just
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that so historically
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
when we put two or three bills towards
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
one issue we get complications like we
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
had in the the last pill we pass
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
something and don't let
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
it don't and we don't absorb it uh and
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
add more that it makes it more
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
complicated so could it not be the case
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
that should both bills pass and they're
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
scrutinized to see are there places
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
where there's contradictions when both
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
bills go over to the Senate they'll
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
figure that out yeah that could happen
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
but I mean I I I know when I a lot of
 
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
salad something's supposed to happen and
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
always so the the point of this bill is
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually using the word
 
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.750 align:start position:0%
actually using the word
contemp

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
right this is actually putting make a
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
referral contempt in that statute so
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
this bill will actually give more teeth
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
Thursday

01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan bill doesn't discuss
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
contemp is what I'm trying to say
 
01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
contemp is what I'm trying to say
representative

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you if I may
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
you you said it gives more teeth and I
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't see if it's following case law all
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing is transferring from case
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
law into the statute books which means
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give it more teeth it's just
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
more available more
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
visible so okay so we'll use that
 
01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
instead is that correct okay yeah okay I
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
am on in the process of
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
examining um a couple of items in the
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
rule of evidence Rules of Evidence which
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
as you know I've read four times and in
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
one of the particular cases or rules the
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
footnotes simply give case law some of
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
which is mutually contradictory and all
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
of it taken together together is
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
insufficient and yet none of the people
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
working with me realized until we have
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
been doing this job for quite some time
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
that tucked away somewhere in the laws
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
is the answer to the question on that
 
01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
is the answer to the question on that
rule

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore people who quickly go to
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
the rules of evidence and go to that
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
section don't know that hence the
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
problem and I mean I felt so good
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a lawyer although
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get me to become one
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
but all these wonderful lawyers didn't
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
see this either and somebody finally
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
spotted it and we all looked at each
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
other and uh said uh the names of these
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
people here will never leave this room
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a gag order on who all the
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers were that missed it but now it's
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
getting put going to be put into Rules
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
of Evidence for from the statute so I'm
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
defending the point that this is a good
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
idea even though there may be case law
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's sure good to get statute where
 
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.950 align:start position:0%
it's sure good to get statute where
people

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
look yeah and that's my point if this is
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
the same as the case law there's no
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
reason not to just put it in the statute
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
books and that's a good thing oh it is I
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
brought two bills already following the
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%

01:17:22.000 --> 01:21:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
we all set Mr chairman I'm looking
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
around before I forget it you've got
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
these documents that at your places and
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
so they don't get just tossed or
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
something they go back to the videoing
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
and restraining and so on so we may want
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
to keep these because we've got a study
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
session coming up in October so just
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't toss them cover looks like
 
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.510 align:start position:0%
don't toss them cover looks like
this

01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think we're ready
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative D Simon I did a side by
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
side with the original Bill and see that
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
the um replace all Amendment uh takes
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
out numbers of things and changes a few
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
through certainly Mr chairman uh if you
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
the first section where it talks about
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
unless the court order uh okay so lines
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
5 through nine really don't
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
change um in the amendment in the
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
amendment correct the
 
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
not uh the amendment actually changes
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.149 align:start position:0%
not uh the amendment actually changes
from

01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
in section
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
two the original Bill said if the court
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
finds the parent has without just cause
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
failed to abide by the terms of the
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule the court shall order
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
additional parenting time to the other
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
parent as compensation for the time lost
 
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
with the child she left that in um and
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not really thrilled about
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
that but what it does is it
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
it the amendment deletes uh section
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
lower case a which says shall be of the
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
same type and duration as the parenting
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
time that was denied or a reasonable
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
approximation thereof we just felt um in
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
discussing this with the the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative that if parent a takes
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
the child for two years and parent b
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
gets the child back if
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
you don't allow the child to see parent
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
a for another two years that's only
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
hurting the child it's it's not doing
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
anything for the parents it's so we
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
asked her to take that
 
01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.270 align:start position:0%
asked her to take that
out

01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
um the and we had it uh we had her just
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
say the court shall order the parties to
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
resume the parenting schedule
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
immediately thereafter according to the
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
original court ordered parenting
 
01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.310 align:start position:0%
original court ordered parenting
plan

01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.669 align:start position:0%
plan
um

01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
so then it it does go on in addition to
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable attorney fees and costs under
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 461a the court May impose a fine of
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
up to of $500 for non-compliance with
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
she wanted it to say each day of
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
non-compliance may be considered a
 
01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.030 align:start position:0%
non-compliance may be considered a
separate

01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
offense uh we had her take that
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
out some of the objections that came up
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
in the hearing it sounds like been
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
addressed in the um replace all
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment yep anyone else representative
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
Raymond uh thank you Mr chairman I am
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
really struggling with competing um
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
philosophies between uh DCF and
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
parenting plans so parenting plans are
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
about the best interest of the child and
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
that's where the judge's focus is
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be DCF is about
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrating whether or not a child has
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
suffered protracted harm or impairment
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
as a result of abuse or neglect if we
 
01:26:13.239 --> 01:26:14.149 align:start position:0%
as a result of abuse or neglect if we
now

01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
tie withholding parenting time to a
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
finding of abuse or neglect we are
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
saying to the judge forget best
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
interests now we only want you to make
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
decisions based on whether or not a
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
child has had protracted harm and so I'm
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
thinking of a situation where DCF gets a
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
report that a parent is on drugs right
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a concern that the child is
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
not being properly supervised because of
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
the parents drug habit it would be very
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
common for a dcyf worker to go out and
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
make a temporary safety plan and say hey
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
until we determine whether or not parent
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
B is on drugs at this current moment we
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
want you to keep the kid here with you
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
right so let's send out the police and
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
let's go check it out and make sure it's
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
safe so parent B might lose one day of
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
parenting time DCF might go out and find
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
out that parent B either wasn't on drugs
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
or does routinely use drugs but not
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
during their parenting time therefore
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's okay under our state
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
law that's an unfounded
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
report under this now parent be who has
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
a drug problem but it isn't a finding of
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
neglect has to have compensatory
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
parenting time and all of this other
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
stuff to me that just really complicates
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
and confuses the issues and I can think
 
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
of dozens of other examples off the top
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
of my head where a dcif worker in
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
conjunction typically with with law
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement might say to a parent when
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
they receive a report hey can we do a
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
temporary safety plan it's Friday
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon at 3 pm we can't interview
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
everybody till Monday can you hold the
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
kids this weekend because it's in their
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
best interest to not be placed at risk
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
of harm and now I I see us ending up
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
with all of these court dates for
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
parents who are like well dcyf unfounded
 
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
it clearly there's no problem I want my
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
C my time back and that's not putting
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the kids first we
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
already passed a bill this year about
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
false reporting right now we're saying
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable reports that DCF is
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
reasonably making effort to keep Kids
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
Safe we're now going to interfere with
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
custody plans I just it makes me really
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and I think it's going to
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
cause a huge backlog in the court system
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
and and I also don't think that it's
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
letting judges have their discretion to
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
situations representative long thank you
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I do also see that and
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
I and I also see uh I I'm looking at
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
this as a the child being treated as a
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
pawn or a tool um to add the time to the
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
other parent uh for
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
example my ex doesn't want me signing up
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
my son for football I signed him up but
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
I have that time with him when we
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
practice and and play games so if I if
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
this was me that for whatever reason I'm
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
not allowing my wife I'm not sending the
 
01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:23.470 align:start position:0%
not allowing my wife I'm not sending the
child

01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
back she would get extra time with the
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
child and that would be that would be
 
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
gone so I I I'm looking at this as the
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
disruption to the child I I get the
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
compensation for the parents but I'm
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
looking at it as the child's uh how is
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
the child disrupted um and and I I think
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
there's Avenues with which they will be
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
disrupted um and a $500 fine where where
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
does that go to a court where the finds
 
01:29:58.109 --> 01:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
suffering and get me to pay my child
 
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
support when I got to pay 500 a day if I
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
more anyone
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
else representative ball thank you
 
01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.590 align:start position:0%
else representative ball thank you
chairman

01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
PE um when a child is kept away from
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
their parent it negative ly impacts the
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
relationship between the parent and
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
child so this is not just about the
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
parent losing time it's the child losing
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
time and ability to continue to build a
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
relationship with their parent so if in
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
the case that representative um Raymond
 
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned where dcyf might say well
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
while we investigate this we're going to
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
leave it with the we're going to keep
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
the child with the other parent for the
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
weekend I agree that if if nothing is
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
found then then make that time up the
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
following weekend um there's no reason
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
to not to deny the child I'm not talking
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
about denying the parent this is denying
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
the child their rightful time with both
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
parents and I think that um we should
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
not be focusing on what the parent is
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
losing but this bill focuses on what the
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
child is losing and that's the access to
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
both parents thank
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
chairman further to representative um
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
Ball's input um you know I have had
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
experience being a stpp parent and also
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
have um from privy to other healthy
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
co-parenting situations and it generally
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
is um practice that sometimes a parent
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh will request of the other parent uh
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
additional time for whatever reason
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
going away on vacation to visit family
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
or what what not and um then you know
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
then it's it's a you know it's an
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
agreement that you know the other parent
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
gets a little more time um somewhere
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
else so I don't um think that that's
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Greg I'm
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with the direction that we
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
continue to keep going in this committee
 
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
where we pass one bill and then we have
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
another bill that either confuses it or
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
competes with it we've already passed
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
106 through here which covers most of
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure why we're we're having
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
so many bills that are so different when
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
they come into our committee and I I'm
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
just concerned about the message that
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
we're sending about the functionality of
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
our committee when we continue to do
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
this if you think that believe me when
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
the chairs
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
meet with 700 800 bills where people who
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
might or could have got together ahead
 
01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
of time before they issued a series of
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
overlapping bills believe me we agree
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee and that solves nothing but
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
here we go representative Bickford
 
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
concerning bills they they have been
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
vetted um at legislative services that
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
each one has its own uh Merit the
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
trouble is that you hear one but you
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
haven't heard the other one yet and and
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
we passing them before that we do the
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
next one um so we can weigh in on that
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
now as far as this amendment goes I like
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
everything in it except one thing and I
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
would have liked to again on line 19 not
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
seeing shall the court shall order I
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
think we could work around it the way
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's written because it doesn't say it
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
has to be the same amount of time like I
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
I do like some degree of judicial
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
discretion Shia usually takes that away
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
but I think the way it continues to read
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
order additional par paring time to the
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
other parent as compensation for time
 
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
lost with the child now there are some
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
parents they can't make up that time
 
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
because of their jobs I have a I'm going
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
to call him a son-in-law that's he has
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
two other another relationship if it
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
happens to him he has to be a work so he
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
would have to probably turn down that
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
compensatory time the way this written
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say I think it's
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay that they they could say to the
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
judge I really can't make that up we're
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to to find some other way
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
to to do it but in the future I'd like
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
to see more discretion with the word
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
made for the judges thank you also what
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
some of thank you also what some of the
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
chairs try to do is if we see bills that
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
are very similar we will try to do them
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the same day but there are a number
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
of reasons why we can't always do that
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
because uh like you may remember when
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley came over we had a
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
senator Becky Whitley afternoon because
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
she had three bill b s and rather than
 
01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
having her make a special trip three
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
times I put all of hers together so I'm
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
aware of that and I try to do that with
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
topics but sometimes there are things
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
that intervene but I I I share the
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
frustration of too many bills and too
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
many overlapping bills well we we used
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
to do more uh side by sides uh when we
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
had bills like we is a difference what
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
does what sure so keep that in mind
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll do anyone else
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative you know repres senat of
 
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
Sullivan there's no gag oder here on you
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying you have to speak but
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
committee you can do anything except
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
make motions so okay the chair
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Sullivan for
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
thinking about doing something I
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually am curious what I obviously
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for any of the testimony but
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
what is this goal essentially to try to
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
prevent people from using children as
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
pwns or a bad faith parent doing
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
something is that is that the goal and
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
is that a common problem that that needs
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be fixed like what I'm going I know
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that this is now it's everybody here's
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
opinion but like we don't know what the
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
the original sponsor was hoping for I'm
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
here whoever wants to answer it
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative long yeah we hear the
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
committee that that's one of the major
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
issues in this committee are parents um
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
kids are being PL as PA so that that is
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
a major issue and a lot of these bills
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
are looking at attempts to uh decrease
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that um so that's what's this about I my
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
opinion I don't believe it does that I
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
think it adds to their being used as
 
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
pawns uh but to re to uh represent a
 
01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
pawns uh but to re to uh represent a
bigford

01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
bigford
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
point um it says the court shall order
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
additional parenting time so the Court's
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to order additional parenting time
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
and what you're thinking is that if if I
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
refuse it because I can't do it then
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's that will be
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
done or am I or do I have to take the
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
I right but I'm wondering if if
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's if this can be interpreted
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
as the other the the parent getting
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
compensated can refuse it I don't know
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
if they can because the judge
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
shall shall be so you're I'm gonna say
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
yeah judge that order I'm not going to
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
accept that order yeah I don't think
 
01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.910 align:start position:0%
accept that order yeah I don't think
that

01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
know yes representative Bal thank you
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and to representative
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
Bickford's point I actually like the
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
word shall in there I think that using
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
the word may makes it a crapshoot it's
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
like well it's 50/50 we don't know which
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
way the judge is going to go so I'm
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
going to just try it let's see but the
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
word shall kind of puts a pause on that
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
to say h I might I might have to pay for
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
this decision of holding withholding my
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
children from you know just to be mean
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to withhold the child um it it
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that time is going to be one
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
to one it just says that he shall order
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
the the um extra time and I'm sure that
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
the parent is sitting there they can
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
actually when this comes up can say I
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't have time or perhaps they would
 
01:38:32.669 --> 01:38:32.679 align:start position:0%
just rather have an extra week um this
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
reminds me of military situations when a
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
person is deployed upon their return in
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
many parenting um plans upon the return
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
they get the child for a week even
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
though they've been deployed for six
 
01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:48.679 align:start position:0%
months or a year they get a week
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
vacation like one solid week with the
 
01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.990 align:start position:0%
vacation like one solid week with the
child

01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
um to make up for the time that they've
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
lost with their child and that's you
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
know it's a different situation but I I
 
01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
see it as being the same that when the
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
child is taken it may not be a onetoone
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
return but there needs to be somehow
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
that that parent gets a little bit of
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
extra time um to reconnect with their
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
them the motion before is is on the
