00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
7 um this bill has come about due to
 
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.110 align:start position:0%
7 um this bill has come about due to
some

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
with some animal cruelty cases and
 
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
people not being
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
educated um all this bill does is
 
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
require 20 20 law enforcement offices in
 
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.350 align:start position:0%
require 20 20 law enforcement offices in
the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
state to be receive
 
00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
standards we I do have an amendment
 
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
forthcoming but OS has not finished it
 
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
yet uh couple of things that it's going
 
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
to add is uh would be an 8h hour course
 
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
approved by the New Hampshire police
 
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
Council and a 2-hour refresher update
 
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
training every 3
 
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.830 align:start position:0%
training every 3
years

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't think eight hours of training
 
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
in a subject
 
00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
matter is a lot to ask from 20 law
 
00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers of the state
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
it would be 10 people in the state Poli
 
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
State Police and one sheriff or Deputy
 
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
County this is a training tool only it
 
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't constitute that they have to do
 
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
anything they're there as a
 
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
resource if
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
needed a lot of small towns and
 
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
communities do not H their local
 
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement does not understand the
 
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty laws of this state they
 
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
do not know what to look
 
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
for and this is not the only thing we're
 
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
mandating is
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
training there is no other
 
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
mandate in
 
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.750 align:start position:0%
mandate in
here

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand why anyone would
 
00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative H
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair good
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
morning is this working it is okay um I
 
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think this is very expensive
 
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything seems to get an FN these days
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't you think that that's not
 
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a heavy lift
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
financially uh thank you for the
 
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 align:start position:0%
question representative H Haskins and no
 
00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's going to be a heavy
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
lift I mean they already have training
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
available this would just be an
 
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
additional course offered and only like
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
I said 20 law enforcement people in the
 
00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 align:start position:0%
state would be required to take that
 
00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
viby so um how does this uh um how does
 
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
this bill relate to the uh requirement
 
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
this constitutional requirement for due
 
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
process how does well I think um with
 
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
the training right
 
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
because when you're talking about due
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
process are clarify are you talking
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
about SU going in in the taking of
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
animals I just want to be sure uh I'm
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the the general right
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
that uh citizens have to expect that
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
when uh they are involved in the Le
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
become involved in the legal system for
 
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
any reason that uh their case will be
 
00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
treated appropriately and correctly
 
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
law well thank you for clarifying that
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that this here with these
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
training courses
 
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
would actually help in the due process
 
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
because you would have PE uh folks that
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
are actually educated in the laws on our
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
books um and understanding what it
 
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
is um and what
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
cruelty is
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
because um and understand when it's okay
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
to remove animals I think that's
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
extremely important and I don't I think
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
we've seen instances in the state where
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
done more harm when people don't
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
understand um the particular animal
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
being uh taken this isn't just about
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats it's about livestock
 
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 align:start position:0%
too and we need people need to
 
00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.270 align:start position:0%
too and we need people need to
understand

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
Miner thank you madam
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.390 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
question

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that uh Animal Control
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
Officers in each of the towns uh would
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
be um fit for this responsibility
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't this seem to be an overlap with
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh with their duties uh thank you for
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
the question representative Miner um so
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
this does not interfere with the
 
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
ACO a lot of towns and rural areas do
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
not have acos it is left up to the local
 
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.070 align:start position:0%
not have acos it is left up to the local
police

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
department um I know in our my town we
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
do not have an
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
ACO um
 
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
and there was an incident um where local
 
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement came in to take care of
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
um a situation with a
 
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.629 align:start position:0%
um a situation with a
horse

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
horse
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
and they thought they did the proper
 
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
thing and then the horse ended up being
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
right back in the same situation a
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
couple days
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
later um and the local law enforcement
 
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
really didn't understand um because it's
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
just not in their band you know it's not
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
what they study it's not what they're
 
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.710 align:start position:0%
what they study it's not what they're
used

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
to and then it took another 10
 
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
days of horses in high heat during the
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
very hot summer not being having good
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
water representative Freeman did you
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
have a question and then represent did
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you but my question
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
was along the line of Representative
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
minor so I got my answer thank you thank
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I wonder
 
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
I and thanks for taking the question um
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
representative come talk um I wonder if
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh so how do you connect the dots
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
between training and action like and how
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
how do how what would be the way to tap
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
into this training by the police force
 
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.029 align:start position:0%
into this training by the police force
at

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
large uh thank you for the question uh
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
um there are several courses out there
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
the police standards would have the
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
final say on what the training would
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
look like however I think that some of
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
that would have to do with um how cases
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
are prosecuted and understanding that
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
aspect because a lot of times um it does
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
we fall down at the
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutor prosecutor level when when
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with these cases and I think a
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
good understanding and good training in
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
that would help because that way all the
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
eyes of Da and te's are crossed you have
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative for taking questions are
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
you aware of any other precedent where
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
um in statute that the legislator
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislature has mandated specific
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
training uh thank you for the question
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair and um
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for you know putting forward
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it has Merit I my
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
question is um given that we're talking
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
about two officers in the county how
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
will you decide who in the county gets
 
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
trained and how would we make sure that
 
00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
those trained people are known to be
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
trained and available to other cities
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
and towns in a
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and well the sheriff sheriffs in each
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
County we of which there are 10 would
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
get to decide which person wants they
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
should train okay and the state police
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure that different troops have
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
different jurisdictions in different
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
counties and they would get to select
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
one person um in each of those counties
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure but at the sheriff's
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
level it would probably be pretty simple
 
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
to find out who's knowledgeable you just
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
called the sheriff's department in you
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
to find out how we would pass that on
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
from the state police down to the local
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
level I'm not sure but maybe it's
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
something that's posted uh through law
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement like I said this is not the
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
only thing that this is mandating is
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
that 20 people take a training course
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
eight- hour training course that's all
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
it's mandating it's not mandating
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
anything else but we need people we have
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
to start somewhere with
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
education okay presentative Bixby so
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of clarification s of
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
the the the way this would work in
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
practice is that uh if uh a if a town
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
that didn't have an
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
ACO uh had uh a call or had a a report
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
of some sort of animal cruelty then the
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
police department in that town could
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
call either the sheriff's office or the
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
state police and ask for assistance with
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
the case so that they could get it right
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
is that is that the way it would
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
generally work thank you for the
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
question represent Bixby and yes that is
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
the intent it's all would also be a
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
resource and maybe they're just the
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
person that's knowledgeable if the local
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
police department has a question so it
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
could be be a duel you know they could
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
have a reference but they could also
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
have someone um who could possibly
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
assist in that matter follow up followup
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
yep and how are the local police
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
departments going to know that this um
 
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.629 align:start position:0%
departments going to know that this um
res

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
exists well I thank you again I think
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that the the way that it would be done
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
is that um the state police uh whoever
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state police officer in the county
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
and the sheriff whoever in the sheriff's
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
office in each County could pass that
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
information on to the local law
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
enforcements in each County I don't
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
think that would be a heavy lift follow
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
up one more followup sure uh would it
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
make sense to add uh add to the
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
amendment a uh the the instruction that
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that information get
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
disseminated to local police
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
forces uh thank you representative Bixby
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be a great idea
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
thanks okay any other questions from the
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
Barber yes thank you so much for your
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um is there currently a
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
Veterinary component involved in the
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
process at this time it seems to me that
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
um the training that we're asking um ex
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
is expansive across many different types
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
of animals um so I'm just curious if um
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
the training would be enough do we have
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that could be contracted
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
by um the county or
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
towns uh thank you for the question
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
represent barbar we do have uh laws
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
already on the books about the removal
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
of animals um this here is just a
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
training component would add the
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
training component into that
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
RSA for because a veterinarian is not a
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency and they have
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
cannot go on to someone's property to
 
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.829 align:start position:0%
cannot go on to someone's property to
remove

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
animals it has to be done through law
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay any other questions
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative ktoa

committee members my name is is William

Wright I am the sheriff of bellnap
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
County and I'm also the president of the
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sheriff's Association I'm
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
here to testify in opposition of this
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill today I've served 27 years in New
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement I'm in my
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
third term as sheriff and uh I've I've
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
been at the sheriff's office now for
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
years there's this bill has two primary
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh components to this uh the first part
 
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.629 align:start position:0%
uh components to this uh the first part
is

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
training we agre agree that training is
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
important and that we should uh continue
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
to uh progress in the training I know
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
that each um recruit class so every
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
police officer that's been certified
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
through the state of New Hampshire has
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
attended a block of study uh through the
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
police academy on uh animal
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
cruelty Advanced Training of course is
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
is available um I don't believe that
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's available through the police
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
standards and training at this time so
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have a course that's readily
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
available for that although there are
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
some uh private classes that we can take
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
through Humane Societies such as that so
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
that's a component that we have to take
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
into consideration as to mandating
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
training that currently doesn't uh exist
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
and I know that uh director Skipper is
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
here and he'll he'll definitely correct
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong uh but I don't believe
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
that there's an actual Advanced course
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
on this uh which is something that I
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
think this bill is trying to
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
Target second is the component that
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
involves the requirement for the
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
sheriff's offices in New Hampshire State
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
Police to participate in potentially
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
assume uh animal cruelty cases and
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
investigations where local M
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities were either called there
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
to uh initially take the report or if
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
they don't have a local municipality uh
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
that that services that town then of
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
course the sheriff's offices and state
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
police would be arriving anyways so we
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
would just naturally assume those
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
cases based on our current legislation
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
under RSA 1045 it defines what the
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
primary duties of the Sheriff's Office
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
and what we're supposed to do on a daily
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
basis as relations to RSA
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
1045 most of my staff and most of the
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
staff that works for Sheriff's offices
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
across our state work dayshift because
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's where the pr primary duties uh
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
that require us to do there we all have
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
staff that are assigned to their duties
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis so having the
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of us uh to be available and
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
to assist local municipalities as a
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
requirement based on this law or this
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
bill that's proposed can create its own
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
uh challenges for us and Staffing in the
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the current St statutory duties that
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
we're required to
 
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
do RSA 104 col
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
6 also talks about other things that
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's offices are able to do which
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
is assist local municipalities as they
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
request we also have the ability to say
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't have Personnel available
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
or we don't have personnel that uh have
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
that education discipline or other uh
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
reasons that we might just not be able
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
to assist and that we would refer them
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
on so we already have an enabling bill
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
that allows us to assist local
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
departments we don't need an additional
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
Bill to tell us that we're required to
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
help or that we need to send somebody to
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
to assist in this some Sheriff's offices
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
don't even have investigative uh
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
deputies assigned to their departments
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
such as Coos they do no criminal work I
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't even and uh Sullivan County I
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
think does very little my organization I
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
have criminal investigators that I've
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
assigned to my organization uh which we
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
do help local departments when when it's
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
necessary this bill was not requested by
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh Chiefs of police
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
which are the ones that would most
 
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
likely be calling for our assistance in
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
place the primary concern of this bill
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
for us on the sheriff's Association side
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
is the Mandate for the Sheriff's offices
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
to to participate in the actual
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
investigation portions and to utilize
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
our resources to assist the M
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh for specific
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
investigations that could be timec
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
consuming And Timely and financially
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
strapping uh in in areas in which we do
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
not normally focus on so I believe at at
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
this point this is not a good PL a good
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
bill for the sheriff's offices to be
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
function the legislation if if passed
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
would create more question for law
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement about who has the ultimate
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the investigation it
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
creates unfunded mandates for the
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
sheriff's offices in New Hampshire State
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
Police and it further creates the need
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
to establish investigator positions or
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
assignments within Sheriff's offices who
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
don't have investigators currently at
 
00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:26.029 align:start position:0%
don't have investigators currently at
their

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
organizations the New Hampshire
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Association Association is
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
comprised of 10 County Sheriffs and in
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
closing we respectfully request that
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 153 FN be voted inexpedient
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
to legislature I'll take questions thank
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby uh one of the
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
issues that you mentioned was in terms
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
of resources uh at this at this point
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
the bill does not have uh any uh funding
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism if uh funding were made
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
available to cover the costs of this at
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
the county level would that uh change
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
your opinion of the
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
bill we would have to Define what the
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
the funding amount is and I'm not
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
talking about dollar amount I'm talking
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
about what that resource will be whether
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
it be an actual person that's hired to
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
specifically handle these types of cases
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
and to be utilized as that resource uh
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't have an answer for that U
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
followup uh if we were to amend the bill
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to work with us to
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
to um make it uh more uh more in line
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
with what you would can um perceive as a
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
possibility if this bill was designed
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to uh capture that we would
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
go to trainings and that we would have
 
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.830 align:start position:0%
go to trainings and that we would have
people

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
trained then you probably not have any
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
opposition from the sheriff's
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
Association where we do have the uh
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
opposition is where it now requires us
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
to have somebody available and to assist
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
we don't always have those luxuries to
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
do that thank
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
committee representative Miner and then
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair do you find
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill to be excuse me timec
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
consuming on your on your part that this
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
that it really doesn't seem to be that
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh to me that there' be that many um uh
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
calls for your your help do you you do
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
consuming we don't know what kind of
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
calls we're going to get so it's always
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
a question uh if we look at a case
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
similar to what wolfboro had to deal
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
with back several years ago with a great
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
Dan that was a significant case with
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
significant time put into that with a
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
significant amount of resources could we
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
as sheriffs or State Police be required
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
to investigate or be participative
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
members in that and now included at a
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
county or state level uh for a Township
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
that could be uh very burdensome and let
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
us not forget that an investigation even
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
though that it starts and it closes it
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't end for us until the court
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
process is over and and all the appeals
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
processes and everything else that's
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
associated with it and the also the more
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
officers that you add to this um
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
investigative process opens us up for
 
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.590 align:start position:0%
investigative process opens us up for
more

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
liabilities thank you for that
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative gerana thank you madam
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you sir for taking my
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
question I understand there's always a
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
concern when responsibilities are added
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
through a form of a mandate you know
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
that there's a mission creep kind of
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
thing that happens and and that more and
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
more responsibilities might be added my
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
question has to do with in your
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh you stated that the concern
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
requirement uh that Sheriff's offices
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
would have to participate in and
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
potentially assume the primary roles in
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
these investigations and uh what I'm
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
wondering looking at the bill is I don't
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
see anything in the bill that says
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
anything other than someone would be
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
available uh to be able to assist I
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
don't see anything here that requires a
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office to take over a primary
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
role uh and and the phrase uh to be able
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
to respond and assist again I I don't
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
really read that as a as a hard and fast
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
mandate because if you don't have the
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
resources to
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
assist you can as you do now say we
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to exist so
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
could you help me understand where you
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
see some type of hard and fast mandate
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the specific specific language of the
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill sure on line 13 where it says who
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
is able to respond and assist local law
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies in that county with
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
any potential investigations on RSA 644
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
col 8 that right there is too ambiguous
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
for us to determine whether or not that
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
means what to what degree the assistance
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
is most of the towns and cities that
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
have Animal Control Officers are able to
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
handle these situations predominantly on
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
their own or with some assistance
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
although they they definitely Take the
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
Lead some of the smaller organizations
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
that have uh part-time police
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
departments or or um one officer type
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
shifts uh would rely on us a lot more
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
heavily to actually assume the
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
investigation once we're involved we're
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
going to take the responsibility of
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that we get to a finish on
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
these cases and a lot of times that
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
means that a local Department that
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to have that officer off
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
the street for any period of time uh
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
that burden gets pushed back up to
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
either the county or the state police is
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
how we view this bill so that wording
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
alone to that if it has to be in a
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislative process to say who's able to
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
respond and assist local law enforcement
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
then that's we consider that a mandate
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
that we would be expected to do what we
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
needed to do to come to resolve which
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
means investigate the the situation
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
there's there's just not enough in that
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
there would not be enough language in
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
that bill as it's written right now to
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
actually Define whose roles and
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities it is to ensure that
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
this invest investigation came to
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
completion follow up thank you I
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and and would you be if
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
this bill were something that you know
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
we were going to work on more and you
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
were to assist us with would would it
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
help do you think to add some clarifying
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
language to the effect of as Staffing
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
allows for example uh because I I can
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
certainly understand uh that there are
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
times when these requests may come in
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
where it's not feasible for you to
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
provide that and that that per that
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense to me so I'm
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's some way that the
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
language might be shaped in order to
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are times when
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
Staffing will not allow for the kind of
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
assistance so as a sheriff we want to we
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
want to take out as much ambiguity
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguity as we can and we want to make
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
sure that um language that says you know
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
as we have Staffing available or what
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
have you uh that can be interpreted and
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
then that can create its own issues
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
where once again we have investigations
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
that don't come the completion and that
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that's and I think representative
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
comptoire is trying to get to a point
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
where uh when an officer gets called to
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
a location it gets investigated they
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
utilize the appropriate resources come
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
up with the appropriate determination on
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
what to do with these animals and then
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
come to a conclusion uh whether it be
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
court process or or education piece um I
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a lot that can be
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
done at the at the County Attorney level
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
and at the Attorney General's level that
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
can be put in policy
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
as to how we're supposed to be doing our
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
job uh when it comes to these type of
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
Cruelty cases and uh more guidance on
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
that that that's not legislative process
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
but more of an administrative process
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
that can be changed and perfected as
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
necessary and direct us to the resources
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we need I don't believe that
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is should be mandated uh
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
for us to as sheriffs in New Hampshire
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
State Police to have to go and and
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually um assist in these manners
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
where we don't know if we're going to be
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
the lead we I would assume that it would
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
be uh if I got a call from a local
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
agency they wanted assistance uh it's
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
not just holding the door for them by
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
the time we get into this they're
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
probably going to step back and allow us
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
to continue to move forward with the
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
case which again is time and resources
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
and it's it's uh it's strapping that
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
that we we have
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
this thank you very much representative
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
sheriff for taking questions are you
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
aware of any um mandates that have been
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature in the past
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
um that are similar in not necessarily
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
nature but just the idea that the
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
legislator has mandated certain training
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
are you aware of anything sure RSA 106
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh which establishes the New Hampshire
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council um
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
they've directed us through that to
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
attend certain trainings and then of
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
course through the PS is where uh we get
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
our directives from so yes in essence
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
there is followup followup y did you
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
find these mandates to be tenable or
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
untenable the mandates were tenable when
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
it comes to training so if this is if
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
this bill was solely about training and
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
that that we're asking for people to go
 
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.710 align:start position:0%
that that we're asking for people to go
to

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
trainings we wouldn't have an argument
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
right now because we would send our
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
people the trainings of course we'd want
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
to Define what that training is is this
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
an 8 Hour online class put on by whoever
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
or is it through the police uh standards
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
and training Council which again I'm not
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
so sure that they have a current
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
Advanced course on this okay thank you
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative H Haskins thank you
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you Sheriff Wright as
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
the loyal daughter of a sheriff I thank
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
you for your service now it seems to me
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that you're the kind of guy I would want
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
to answer these calls so I if this is
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
going to be um within a department
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who has an inkling toward this
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
and they would be glad to take the
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
training the the problem exists the
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
animals are going to you know
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
occasionally have need of
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
intervention wouldn't we rather have
 
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
someone who has the training if you're
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
going to get the call perhaps
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
anyway yes of course we want uh thank
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
you thank you for recognizing me and um
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
we do want well-trained people we do
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
want the people who are passionate we
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
try to we try to as as department
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
leaders we try to negotiate our people
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh into areas of their passion because
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a better work
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
result mandating us to be participative
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
members and is where I find that this is
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
problematic like myself if I have
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel that have a passion for this
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
and I hear of an organization within my
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
community that needs
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
help I offer that assistance to that
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
Community now it's up to that that chief
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
officer whether or not they want to
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
accept the help or not which they make
 
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.149 align:start position:0%
accept the help or not which they make
that

00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
determination but we most certainly make
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
it available to them and they can
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
utilize the service if they want but we
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
Sheriff me I direct what my Personnel do
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
and I and I know how to manage their
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
time and what we have work product so I
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
know the balance between what we're
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
required to do by RSA 104 and what we
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
can do by RSA 106 and this part right
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
here where um this bill would now add
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
another layer to this that's requiring
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
us to do a specific function which I
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe needs to needs to be there
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
each Sheriff has the ability and each uh
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
chief officer of every municipality has
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to uh offer assistance when
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
necessary so we already have these
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
enabling bills we don't need another
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill to require us to do something
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
specific where if I can offer people
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
then I do if I don't have the resources
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
then I don't offer it and I try to I try
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
to get them to another resource
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um Sheriff rright I have a
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
question and I'll get to yours as
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
well in the current Sheriff training or
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
police training that uh is required by
 
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.470 align:start position:0%
police training that uh is required by
other

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
rsas do you receive training uh
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
regarding animal cruelty uh reports how
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
to report them uh what what animal
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
cruelty looks like uh any of that do you
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
do you get that kind of training in your
 
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
do you get that kind of training in your
normal

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
training not so much who to report it to
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
because people report the crimes to us
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
so we're the ones that take the
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
information and and then either bring it
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
up to the criminal level of of
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
prosecution or we defer to other
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
organizations across our
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
state I'm not sure if that answers your
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
um like if if I had a question about an
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh animal Cru case um I might call uh
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
the state agriculture I might call the
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
State Vet I might call my local vet I
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
may uh call an ACO and ask them you know
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
who who to talk to or maybe they have
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
that expertise again I think that uh our
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
resources defining our resources could
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
be better and that we could again this
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
is something that could be built into
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
part of the Attorney General's manual to
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
where where do you go if you have um you
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
know an equin or or a swine issue or a
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
question U I can't tell you what a Sit
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
cow looks like unless it's absolutely
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
obvious well that's what the point of
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is is to make sure that the
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
folks in law enforcement do do know what
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
a sick cow looks like or what uh what
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
abuse looks like and um because we're
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
finding more and more as um reports are
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
are made uh that law enforcement
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh coming to these uh places where the
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
reports are being made U they are they
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
are unable to really tell what they're
 
00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:09.350 align:start position:0%
are unable to really tell what they're
looking

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
at and this is this is sort of a remedy
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
to try and get more people in law
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement to understand what it is
 
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
they are looking at I'm not so sure a
 
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519 align:start position:0%
weekl long uh eight hour training or a
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
week-long training would would get us to
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
where we need to be for all the various
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
animals that people have but I can tell
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
you that given me a a resource book that
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
shows uh if you have ecoin issues or
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
that you have a question about it that I
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
can call this one specific number and
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
reach somebody and then get their uh
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
opinion whether it be they show up which
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
we've had investigations where people
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
actually show up and they take a look
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
again Dr Crawford the State Vet uh we if
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
we call his office uh we explain what we
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
have but sometimes we send photographs
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
down and then they'll make a
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
determination if they're going to send
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
an actual person person who is uh
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
certified to to identify that this is
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
actually what it is I think the burden
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's trying to be put on police as
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
to decide whether or not an animal is
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
sick or not uh without with with the
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
exceptions of obvious um issues it it I
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
think it becomes more of a a problem for
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
us that this is not our area of
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
expertise and and I don't think that you
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
can capture that in a in a short class
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
or something that we would think would
 
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.750 align:start position:0%
or something that we would think would
be

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
um acceptable to teach in in such a
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
short confined time frame and then again
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's resources what resources do we have
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh sending these officers away having
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
them go up and look at these animals
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
doing an
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
investigation again we we have people
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
that we call so so I think that we can
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
capture what the goal is is to get it
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
from time of call to time of prosecution
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
if it gets to that uh and the safety of
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
the animals in between that's where we
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's where it needs to be focused on
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
not a bill that requires me to go out
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
and do an investigation
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Penza and then
 
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Penza and then
representative

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
Howard so I kind of have a followup to
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron um would you
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
believe that having some training in a
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
in a subject matter um one law
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer is better than
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
having no
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
training absolutely I think training is
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
key and and again we get the basics at
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
the Academy and then it's up to the the
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
uh leadership of the organization
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
whether they want to send
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
officers deputies to additional Advanced
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
trainings follow up
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
followup so the bill is specific
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
that you it's requiring one in one
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
sheriff in in one County and to have
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
that level of training which might just
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
be basic and it's assisting an
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
investigation not you guys taking over
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
the investigation and the specifics of
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
that training which I I think you have
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
concerns on that would be defined by
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
rules so you don't have to Define them
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily you can in the legislation
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
but would that make a difference well I
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
think if you're trying to create
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that requires a training
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
that you have to be defined of what
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
training it is that you're actually
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
looking for and and then we can start
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
honing it in to say and then what is the
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
participative member portion of this and
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
again I'm here because we're we're not
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not concerned about the training the
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
sheriff's Association is not concerned
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
about training because we've all
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
received the training we've all every
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement officer and
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
all of us go to the same Academy state
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
police sheriff's office local police
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
City Town conservation we all go to the
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
same Police Academy we sit in the same
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
room and we go through the same uh
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum so we get this training
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
already that's part of your
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
certification process it's the ongoing
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
continued education that is that is open
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh conversation whether or not we
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
want to require additional training
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
beyond that and then this this bill here
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
is of course saying that that that the
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
additional training would have to be
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
there so it' be more advanced training
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
well what Advanced Training do we want
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
to to make that be we have to Define
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
what it is that we're trying to
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
ascertain for a goal here and then and
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
then the idea of having that single
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
person in a county available to assist
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
um who is able to respond and assist the
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
local agencies that's the other sticking
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
point here is now you're requiring me to
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh who's able to respond and assist it
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say who may uh go out and help
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
you know to what level of assistance it
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
is and this is where we run into our our
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
problems again I I agree that we want to
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
get these cases investigated we want to
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
we want to get the call get the animal
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
safe get them to the investigatory
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
portion to where we can get people uh
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
into court or educated depending on what
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
it is and then come to the absolute
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
resolve that's exactly what we want but
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
this bill right here requires a certain
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
group to do it and this and in that if
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
we have to be participative members in
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
it we rather send our person as a
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
resource and be able to not have to take
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
over the case and not have to because
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
again it it's it's too ambiguous for us
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make that determination based on this
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
and we know when legislation comes into
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
place it's very easy for or anybody to
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
say no that's your you know we ask for
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
your assistance and you're and what
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're asking for is you to take the case
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
and this is where the problems start
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
coming in and then and then the end
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
result is is that the animals lose and
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
that's not what we want so that is not
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
the goal representative Howard you're
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
next thank you madam chair um assuming
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
that that continuing training results in
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
Greater skills and maybe even
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
specialization as as this one hopefully
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be designed to do um does do you
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
think that having additional
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
skills um somehow disallows
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
prioritization of the of the of the um
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
assignment of ass of your assets or your
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
resources in your office do do you
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
understand my question so no could you
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
repeat that please so just BEC just to
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
put it really simply just because you
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
have the specialization inous doesn't
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
does it mean that that overrides other
 
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.950 align:start position:0%
does it mean that that overrides other
specializations

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
specializations
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
and resources in at hand to the point
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
where you feel like it binds
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
you yeah so we have I mean we have
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
different Specialties I mean I'd love to
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
be able to assign somebody to be um you
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
know an animal cruelty expert I mean i'
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
I'd love to be able to utilize that as a
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
resource but I don't have that I I have
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
nine full-time employees that work for
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
me and out of those nine they're working
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
they they they work the same shift and
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're out working right now
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they're doing their statutory duties
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
now if we were to be asked by a local
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
organization within our uh County to
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
come down and assist with an
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
investigation again to what what degree
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
at what point do do I have the ability
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
to say I'll send them down to assist to
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
direct traffic but that's it or or are
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
we talking about we're assuming the
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
entire case too ambiguous language I
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
tell you at some point somebody will say
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
well it says to assist and the
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
assistance I was asking for was for you
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
to assume this in instigation and now
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
I've tied up my resources uh for that
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
investigation and and they may even have
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
somebody trained in it well everybody
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
gets trained in their organization
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
because we all have the same
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
certification so it's whether or not
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
we've gone above and beyond the training
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh to a different level ask a quick qua
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
sure um so so it sounds to me as if you
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
believe that this limits your choices
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
about how you assign your
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
employees well as written I believe that
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
it it makes it a requirement um that we
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
assist and and if if you're asking for
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
County to be involved as the the person
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
who is able to respond and
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
assist the question that I have is at
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
what point can I can I then go forward
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
and say I don't have a resource uh call
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
State and then the state going to turn
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
around and say no call County and then
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say ah you know this isn't
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
really our area like how does this work
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
what what's the remedy here and and I
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
think that this is problematic as it
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
relates to that so again we we as
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office we have well-defined
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
areas in which we operate in and this
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
only convolutes it even more and now
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're entertaining more
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
um or it's intertwining more
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
organizations where it doesn't need to
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
be we already have the ability if I need
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
help from State Police I give them a
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
call they either say yes we have
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
resources or not it's no different than
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
a local municipality calling me and
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
saying we need a resource are you
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
available yes we are or no we're not
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's um I I think that in this
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislation here in this bill if passed
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
it it would kind of require us to do
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
it okay I'm going to call on
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby then representative
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
King and then representative Penza oh
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry uh representative Freeman
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
you're first then Bixby then King Madam
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate that I know I'm
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
sitting low and I'm sitting over on the
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
side so should I jump up and down no no
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
no no I'm
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Sheriff Wright for being
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
here I have I I have a two-part question
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
Madam if you'll indulge me and I'll make
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
it as quick as possible um first off uh
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
Sheriff right what is the normal
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
procedure right now if somebody calls
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
with the suspected case of animal
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
cruelty and you can give it to me in
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
like a thumbnail sketch sure ultimately
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
they would call into whatever dispatch
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
facility that local police department
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
has and the local police department
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
would dispatch or our dispatch would
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
actually like in belnap County our
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
dispatch would then dispatch out that
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
officer to go out and handle the call
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
okay and and this is the the second part
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you so that would that
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
would make that officer who responded to
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
the call the investigating officer is
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
that correct yes they would be the
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
primary responding officer okay did you
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
know that there's a law on the books
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
right now that says the investigating
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
officer must be accompanied by a vet
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um if they if they decide
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
to take livestock or any other the
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
animals from the from that household or
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
establishment no I was not aware of that
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to say I I appreciate the
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire F Bureau of federation
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
their letter because they actually
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
pointed out that statute to me that
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
there is a law on the books that says
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
that any investigating officer must have
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
and must be accompanied by a local
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or a state veterinarian in
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
order to take the animal from the
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
premises so again in bellnap County we
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't we don't do rural Patrol for uh
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
local towns so I don't I don't have have
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
any towns that I contract with or that
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
were their primary um responders so uh
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're a support service and and that's
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's we support them the best we can
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't I'm not familiar with that uh
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
that information in that law because
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're not the ones that are
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
predominantly getting the phone calls
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
for that and again we do get calls and
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
we do uh go out to assist so we we do
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
help local departments out thank
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
you represent vix yeah this is U
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
essentially a followup uh to
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman's point I just
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to make it uh be absolutely clear
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the responsibility for
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
the invest for the
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
investigation uh that fall does that
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
fall directly on the local uh law
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement agent in that in the town
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
where the or city where the um incident
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
is taking
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
place as of right now if they get the
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
call that is their their responsibility
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you okay representative King
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then Penza thank you again Madam
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
chair I'm trying to wrap my head around
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
this bill because what I like to do is
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
try and figure out like an analogy and
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if there's anything
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
analogous to this bill in terms of like
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
child abuse so you know if there's a res
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
if there's a call in a complaint about
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
child abuse law enforcement shows up you
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
know at the end of the day all they can
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
do is use their eyes and ears and you
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
know if there's a rug burn you eh it
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like child abuse but you
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
know if that if the child is in a really
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
bad condition you have to use your you
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
know your your professional judgment you
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
know to say Hey you know something needs
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be done here and I'm just curious do
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
we have mandates like what's in this
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
bill for child abuse or are we really
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
relying on just common sense here to
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me like if there's a
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint about child abuse
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
the officer would use I would hope good
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
judgment in determining whether or not
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
they think there has been and then
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's going to go to doctors
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
pediatricians somebody who really
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
understands the issue about what is and
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
isn't child abuse and then that's at
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
that point it's more or less for the
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
courts you know to kind of figure out I
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
don't know it just seems kind of weird
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
the idea that law enforcement needs to
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
be you know professional in every little
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
possibility with child abuse or animal
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
cruelty or all these different things so
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is is there
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
something equiv to this for child abuse
 
00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:30.270 align:start position:0%
something equiv to this for child abuse
or

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
not well I mean we have
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory processes when it comes to
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
child abuse or suspected child abuse so
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
and again we we reach out to other
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
resources so it's it's not always um the
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office or local PD that has to
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
has to deal with that stuff that's kind
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
of what I'm getting at with this entire
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
bill is that we have resources available
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know where this derives from I
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't again the chiefs of police aren't
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
aren't the ones asking for us to have to
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
do this and all that so I don't I don't
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand the the the process here
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
other than uh I I like the idea of more
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
training training is great right so so
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
our people training that's fine it's the
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
mandates that we have the problem the
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
the you know again who's able to respond
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
and assist that that's where we run into
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
our biggest problems here okay thank you
 
00:46:18.119 --> 00:46:19.549 align:start position:0%
our biggest problems here okay thank you
representative

00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
Penza so language is so key and um I've
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
learned that a lot in my last term um
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
you keep saying mandate you keep saying
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
words like must um nowhere in the bill
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
does it say that it doesn't say must it
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
says who is able to assist there's no
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
there's no mandate no taking over an
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
investigation or anything like that so
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
where you can't read into a bill that
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it it says able there's
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
no must there's no mandate so I believe
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill was initially designed to
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
to fix a problem in that that obviously
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's some form of a
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
problem and I can tell you that this
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the way it's written it's going
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
to come across as no we we're asking you
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
for assistance and it says who's able to
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
respond and assist local law enforcement
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
we want to pass this on to you and the
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
the perception is going to be that we're
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to take this over or that
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to create this this thing
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't come to resolve so I can
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
tell you there's a problem with this and
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to it's going to end up that
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of forewarning you that this
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
is what's going to happen if this bill
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
portion continues to to be what we
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
believe to be a
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
mandate okay can I follow um yeah quick
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
followup we're we're running late and I
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
want to just move along here with all
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
due respect law doesn't work that way
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
perception doesn't matter it's exactly
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
what is written and that's how it will
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
be so that's where you push back if it
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
turned into something that is there
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
question represent so wouldn't that so
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
you follow the law so I don't understand
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
how you're going to read into something
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't want that that's
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
how that's the your expertise and
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
fighting back so wouldn't that make a
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
difference in this no I think that the
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
law needs to be really defined as as
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
saying if if of what exactly the
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
expectations are and what the end result
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
is is going to be I think this is way
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
too ambiguous and I believe that it it
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
does create this question and and I
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
think we're going to the intent of this
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh it would be nice to have what what
 
00:48:30.359 --> 00:48:31.069 align:start position:0%
uh it would be nice to have what what
the

00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
intended portion of this is actually
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
spelled out in and puts it out to where
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
we need it to be so there isn't any
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions about it okay representative
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
you for being here your perspective is
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
very important um regarding the
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
language now it does as written right
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
now it says any potential investigation
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I take that you're assuming that
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
that could be a situation where this
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
whole investigation could be pushed onto
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's department um if that
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
language said um any uh helping with the
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
initial investigation does that would
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
that clarify the fact that you're just
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
there to give your quick opinion as to
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on here but the
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the subsequent
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
investigation remains with the agency
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
assisting more clarifying language is
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
always better for us so we know who the
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
one is going to be the one that's going
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
to be the ultimate responsibility of
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you thank you very much
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%

Representatives um I'm here with the
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
state police and we are neutral to this
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill um I have a few comments and then
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to answer any questions
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
that you may have um so police standards
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
and training currently provides training
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
during the police academy on
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 45 different investigative
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
taxs that include investigative
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
complaints of animal abuse or neglect
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and use uh available resources to
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
resolve instances of animal cruelty uh
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
the state police is always willing to
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
assist local and county law enforcement
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
agencies with complex investigations
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
that require additional
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
resources um I'm unaware of any
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
additional training um that is currently
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
offered by uh pstc I'm sure director
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
Skipper can um clarify
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
that um criminal investigations
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
involving animal cruelty are conducted
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
like any other criminal investigation
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
ation um and to answer representative
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
King's uh question earlier uh there are
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
three trainings that are required
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
through uh police standards and training
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's a two-hour block um on implicit
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
bias two-hour block on ethics and two
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
hours on deescalation and then
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that is an additional
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
18 hours of inservice training um but it
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
isn't specified I am unaware of any
 
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.309 align:start position:0%
isn't specified I am unaware of any
other

00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
um specific crime that requires training
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
that is specific to that so for child
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
abuse or human trafficking um or any
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
other crimes against persons crimes
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
against property I'm unaware of any
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
specific training that's required um for
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'm also unsure if it's
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to require a trooper from
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
every County need to have additional
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
training regarding animal cruelty
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
specifically uh again we have
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
investigators throughout the state um we
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
receive training um in
 
00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.470 align:start position:0%
receive training um in
investigations

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
um in general but specifically um we we
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
may send investigators to different
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
trainings um but nothing specific to
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty okay thank you any
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh if we chose to
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh amend this bill would you be willing
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
to uh would you or someone from your
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
department be willing to uh help assist
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
with the process to make sure that it's
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
consistent with um the state police's
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
practices and and um and uh abilities
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
committee representa Scully thank you
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair do you have a state police
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh station in every
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
County not in every County we have um
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
troop stations throughout the state but
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
some of those troop stations are two
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
counties okay any other questions
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative Penza uh just quickly um
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
what is the numbers currently right now
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
um that are state troopers how many are
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
employed and are you guys at full
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
capacity and if you are at full capacity
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
what would that number be uh thank you
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
for the question uh when we are at full
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
capacity we have 362 sworn uh Troopers
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
currently we have 62 vacancies um which
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
is about 177% of our Force so to
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
mandate one Trooper Per County um could
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
potentially be problematic if that
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
Trooper is on
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
vacation we would be pulling troopers
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
from from other counties or other other
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
areas um major Crim is a good example
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
their house out of conquered they're
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
spread out throughout the state um we
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
pull resources wherever we need to um
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the case is if
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's a case and there's a local
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
agency um that requires assistance or is
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
asking for assistance we'll provide
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
whatever resources we have um with the
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
the larger more complex cases we pull
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
resources from all over the state so I
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's necessary to have
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
one Trooper designated Per County um
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
when they may be they may be stationed
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
in a different County than where they
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
reside um we also have transfers
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
Troopers move um within within the state
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
so um if that answers your
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
question quick followup yep sorry I know
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
I'm delaying time just quickly um just
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
like in the legislature we just you know
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
we get to pick what committees that we
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
on that were on do you feel as if um
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
based upon State Troopers that might
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
have an interest that there would be one
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
out of a county that would be interested
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
in maybe um taking this extra course and
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
because it's not in a sense a mandate it
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
would be one and it would be based upon
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
someone that's able so if they were on
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
vacation that's okay because there is a
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
basic training that you're already
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
getting um that this is offered you know
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
to basically 10 State Troopers that
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
there would be an interest somebody
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
might want to take that little extra bit
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
to be that the point person for the
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
county don't you think there would be
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
interest in that just like we have
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
interest in certain committees
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
here thank you for the question um I'm
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there would be interest um 10
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
is a big number 10 is a big number
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
we we require a lot of our of our
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
Troopers um they get pulled in a lot of
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
different directions um right now you
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
see the the State of the State if you
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
will in our highways and um the high
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
speeds and we're trying to combat that
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it seems like we're we're constantly
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
pulling Troopers to go do additional um
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
tasks whether that's becoming a drug
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
recognition expert or accident
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
reconstruction or there's a whole Litany
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
of additional
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um we're not opposed to
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
this bill um it's just requiring one in
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
every County could become problematic
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
and I agree that eight hours of train
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
training you don't become a subject
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
matter expert uh it's a little bit of
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
training training is good um we're all
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
for for training our our
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
personel but I think if you were to have
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
an 8 hour class you may get more than 10
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
or 20 in the entire State um some of
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
them may be local officers who have
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in these cases that's who
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
should be going to these trainings as
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
well but to mandate um one Trooper in
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
every County I don't know if that solves
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
the the problem um if there is a problem
 
00:56:59.559 --> 00:57:00.750 align:start position:0%
the the problem um if there is a problem

Brown representing yourself and speaking

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you good morning my name
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
is Lucy Brown I'm the second VP for the
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
new hampsh Farm Bureau vice president
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
for bnpp County and a young farmer board
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
member my husband and I are first
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
generation Farmers raising sheep and
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
beef cattle in our small town of new
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampton we have all manners of livestock
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
owners from a thriving raw dairy farm to
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
hobbyists with pet goats and
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
equestrians our town is lucky enough
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
that our chief of police has some
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
background in livestock as his family
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
raises a beef steer and pigs on occasion
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
so when he has been called out to assess
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty complaints he has some
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge that he can rely on for
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
example is that cow starving or is it a
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
dairy cow that's in good condition and
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
lactating or is that horse starving and
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
neglected in a dirt lot with no grass or
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
is it on a very strict diet because of
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
Cushings or found dir disease well there
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
are well-meaning citizens there's a lot
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
of misinformation and we as a state
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
should be protecting our
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
agriculturalists by extending training
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement officers to have
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
some background on the Humane treatment
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
of livestock we can have effectively Pro
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
protect our livestock and their owners
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
from forc surrenders and scare tactics
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
that human societies use to bully owners
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
into relinquishing well cared for
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
Animals it's my hope that you all take
 
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
into consideration our Collective
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
experiences and thoughts on the matter
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
so that our small small farms can
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
continue to thrive in our
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
state thank you for your testimony any
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
question in your experience uh either
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
within Farm Bureau or you know just as a
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
in living in a rural community do you
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
feel that la enforcement in general be
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
it Sheriff's Office State Police local
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and I know that there
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
are some small town small some small
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
rural towns that don't even have a
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
police force so they maybe rely on state
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
troopers and so forth do you feel that
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
in general um that law
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement has an adequate background
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
in what animal cruelty looks like no
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you our our chief although he
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
has some background in livestock there
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
have been a couple occasions where
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens have called in abuse
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
Char um thoughts of abuse and he's
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually referred to myself and other
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
Farmers with good standing in the
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
community to come and check and see if
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's something that need to be further
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
investigated or that we can just let it
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
lie so do you think having some extra
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
education would help law enforcement
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
especially in preparing whatever reports
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
they have to prepare PR personally I
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe that yes if they had additional
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
training but if they also had resources
 
01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
of somebody that they could call to
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
investigate um if they just call a
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
regular vet that specializes in guinea
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
pigs and cats that vet is not going to
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
be adequate at assessing whether that
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
pig or that cow is in a safe condition
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I appreciate your
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
time today thank you I will call Stacy

Ober from the American Kennel
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
Club who has asked for three minutes and
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
I believe you've already uh passed out
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
testimony to us thank you good morning
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
chair Erin uh members of the committee
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
my name is Stacy oer I am the New
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
England manager of government relations
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
for the American Kennel Club which is a
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
140 year old nonprofit widely recognized
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
for expertise in K9 Health breeding and
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
training and we represent more than
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
5,000 dog clubs across the country with
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
13 here in New Hampshire I did submit
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I thought I would
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
focus on some of the testimony that
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
you've heard uh this morning that I
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
might offer some uh additional comment
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
on you know my experience in covering
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
the six New England states has been that
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know everyone believes animals
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
deserve life in a safe caring and
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
healthy environment and that enforcing
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
our animal cruelty laws is very
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
important which is why AKC supports
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
153 um because we see it as providing
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
some uniform training that's specific to
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
animal husbandry practices and Animal
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
Welfare which from my observation is
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
very much a team approach um which is
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
why I wanted to turn to the bill and
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
just note that as I read for instance
 
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.109 align:start position:0%
just note that as I read for instance
line

01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
six and who is able to respond to and
 
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
assist local law enforcement agencies in
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
that county with any potential
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
investigation I kind of interpreted ass
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
Cy more as a consultation role um I also
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag that AKC has a Humane
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
fund which is a small grant that we
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
offer to domestic violence shelters and
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's specifically to afford them some
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
money to allow kennel space to allow a
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence for instance
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
to bring the family pet and the reason I
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
raised this is that I'm seeing more and
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
more States actually acknowledge the
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
relationship between animal cruelty and
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and so to have law
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh available with some
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
expertise and training around what
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty looks like these are
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
typical criminal uh offenses or calls
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
that I think law enforcement might get
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
for either um domestic violence or even
 
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
for drug crimes uh that's another
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
setting where in fact you will typically
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
see animal cruelty take place and so um
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
my read on the bill was really to have
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement as a identifier where
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
there is animal cruelty and to then make
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
contact and consultation with those who
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
are responsible in that jurisdiction to
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
engage in um the investigation um last
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
we know that Humane officers do in fact
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh need training they need an
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of the Fourth Amendment so
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
that investigations and evidence
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
collection is done in a legal
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh Manner and there has been in New
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
England states that have adopted
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
required training for Humane officers
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
that for instance in Vermont is I is
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
defined as also including law
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
enforcement um there's required training
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
there um Massachusetts for instance
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
under the state police has specific
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
statutory language that has a special
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
unit where those state police officers
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
are uh very knowledgeable and conduct
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
all of the animal cruelty inves ation in
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
the state so I wanted to give you just
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
those two examples um and acknowledge
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
our support for a systematic uniform
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
approach to investigating animal cruelty
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you thank you
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for coming here
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
today uh you brought up one of the
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
questions that I've been thinking about
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
in my head and that is um you know when
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
it comes to certain things um law
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement has like special police you
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
know we've got like the ATF or gambling
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
or you know we've got certain um sort of
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
you know regulatory police that like
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
they're just Specialists that's all they
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
do um do you think that would be and
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
then you also mentioned that other
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
states have things like that for animal
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
cruelty do you think that would be a
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
better method to go about instead of
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
having you know just the local state
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
police or local County Sheriff do that
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
why not just have you know some actual
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
like Specialists that that is like all
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
they do is animal cruelty and then yeah
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
they might not be in every County but
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
maybe they're based in conquered and
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
then when there's a call they can drive
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
to the the nether regions of the state
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
to to get there I mean would that be a
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
better method do you think I think
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
that's why some states have chosen to do
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
it that had the resources to do it that
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
way because um Prosecuting an animal
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
cruelty case is not an easy thing to do
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
you have to provide the appropriate
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
evidence it has to be timely evidence um
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
if any part of the search warrant was
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
conducted in an illegal way that
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
evidence gets thrown out so there is
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
some I think benefit from having
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who are consistent you know
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
and have the training and are
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
consistently uh facing these cases and
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
know how to deal with them so thank you
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony this
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
morning I'm going to call uh Kurt
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
aronburg from Humane Society United
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
States needed uh ask for two minutes to
 
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:59.349 align:start position:0%
States needed uh ask for two minutes to
speak

01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
it off turned it off hi I'm Kurt
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%

director for the Humane Society of the
 
01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.069 align:start position:0%
director for the Humane Society of the
United

01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
United
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
States uh thank you for allowing me to
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
speak I
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh along with the uh sponsor of this
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill serve on the governor's Commission
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
on the Humane treatment of
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
animals um the commission has had and I
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
speak for my myself here not the
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
commission but the commission has
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
had discussions over a couple of
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
years the need
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
for uh GA almost a guaranteed for lack
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
of a better term right now response to
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
an animal cruelty call and my my concern
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
as representing the animals in New
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that if an animal is is the
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
victim of Cruelty and a call is made to
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
that local police department that
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
someone in law enforcement with
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge of how to deal with that case
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
in response not necessarily further down
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
the road and investigation Etc that
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be great all this talk about a
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
special unit we'd be all for that but
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
currently there there are animals in the
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
state that suffer cruelty without any
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
means for their their ability to be uh
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh alleviated of that suffering by law
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement so what we're for this
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill um it's it's certainly imperfect
 
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
and needs Amendment
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
overall immediate need for the animals
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
state is whether they're on a farm or in
 
01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:53.950 align:start position:0%
state is whether they're on a farm or in
a

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
home uh someone to respond immediately
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
who can assess the situation and take
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
action and I think that needs to be said
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
here today and I think that's the
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
direction this committee uh needs to go
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
in to protect the animals thanks thank
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
you questions representative
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
ruber thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony you said the bill
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
you're supportive of this bill but uh
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it needs some amendments
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
can you clarify a little bit what sort
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
of modification you think would make
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
this bill even stronger well you
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
know my understanding is you can make
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
you can amend the bill to start all over
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh and but I mean my comments speak for
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
themselves I
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
think I believe certainly investigations
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
are very
 
01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
are very
important

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
but listening to the objections of law
 
01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement on this um it seems like we
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
could do something immediately that
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
would take care of the response
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
situation and not and and
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh that would be my my first
 
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.510 align:start position:0%
uh that would be my my first
concern

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you thank you for your
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it um our last pink
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
card is from John
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
sippa and
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
um you have requested five minutes I
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
hope you can make it less because we are
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
running very late
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
all uh my name is John skippa I am the
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire police
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
standards and training I've been a
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
police officer in the state of New
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for about 40 years now uh and
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that uh during the course
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
of my career uh while these uh types of
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
cases animal cruelty cases uh
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
I did have a couple of few but the
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
number of them are are not uh a lot
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
right uh I was also fortunate enough to
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
be the chief of the stratum police
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
department and so the New Hampshire SPCA
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
was literally right down the street from
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
our station so we would rely on them a
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
lot for these types of
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
Investigations while sitting here
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
listening to the other folks that were
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
providing testimony I checked that I was
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of this but really I'm kind of
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
neutral and I'm here to just offer some
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
information my first observation is that
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
this bill really cuts across two
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
different issues the first one is
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
operational and you heard the sheriff
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
and you heard the captain from the state
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
police talk about some of the concerns
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
they have about the
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
operational of the way this bill is
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
written and I'm not really here to uh
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
discuss that other than to say that I do
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
agree with both the the sheriff and the
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
captain that there would be some some
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
operational ambiguity there that
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be cleaned up I think
 
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
more importantly I'm here to talk about
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
the training
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh I can tell you that uh listening to
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Barbour uh relative to
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing that these are complex cases
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
that that need both training for
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
investigative purposes and for
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial purposes as well um uh
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative King you you were spot on
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh an operational way to address this in
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
my opinion would be to create a
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide task force uh we have task
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
force uh operation for a bunch of other
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
different uh topic areas investigative
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
areas to include crash investigation uh
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
drug investigations uh gun
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
investigations and so uh there clearly
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
is uh a way to put this into operational
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
um it put it into operations by way of a
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
task force that task force comes under
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh agriculture I don't know does it come
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
under State Police or Department of
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
Safety I don't know but I think that
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
would be the way to to do that I think
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
also the way this bill is written is
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
that it's cutting out about 3,000 cops
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh that uh and I I apologize I cannot
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
see your name placard but the
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
representative spoke to uh some folks uh
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
that are in law enforcement that would
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
have an interest in this particular
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
topic and I can tell you uh teaching at
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
the police academy we see people from
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
all walks of life come to be police
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
officers and many of them are gentlemen
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
Farmers quite frankly lady farmers that
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
come in and they have a extensive amount
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
of background uh with regard to dealing
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
with uh farm animals uh again very
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
specific and very different than uh
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with a household pet a dog or a
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
cat right um the way the bill is written
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's really just kind of you know we
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
want the sheriffs to receive the
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
training and we want the state police to
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
receive the training but uh it it might
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
it might be hoov this this committee to
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
look at uh making this available to
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
anybody that's in law enforcement that
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
has an interest and then creating a task
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
force to do
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
that the real reason I'm here is uh to
 
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
speak to the development of the training
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the bill suggests that the training
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
will be provided by New Hampshire police
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
standards and training uh in the short
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
time that I've been the director I've
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
been asked to do a bunch of extra things
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
that we didn't do before I was appointed
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
and I was uh always ready to say yes we
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
can do this but I never asked for money
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I learned that that we can do these
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
things but it does cost money uh we
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
certainly can rely on different partners
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire to
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
number one identify what the problem is
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
right now why are we having why is this
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
bill in front of all of you uh what what
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
are we trying to solve so we need to
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what we're trying to
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
solve uh work with subject matter
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
experts to identify those learning goals
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
and objectives and then work with the
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts to build out a
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
block of instruction to address the
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
shortfalls that we're seeing right now
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh that may cost money uh and I would
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
need uh the um some money to be uh
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
provided in order for us to uh make sure
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we can cover any costs that are
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
incurred uh we would stand ready to work
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
with subject experts to put this uh
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
training together and to deliver it uh
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
but to that end
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh th this clearly is uh something that
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
has uh caused some issues that need to
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed We Stand ready at police
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
standard and training to do what we can
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
to provide that training uh to New
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement uh to make
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
sure that we're taking care of these
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
animals that are being abused and I
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
stand ready for any questions that this
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee might
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr Skipper um I have a
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
question so far as uh your your present
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
training for or law enforcement to what
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
extent Does it include how to identify
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh issues of animal cruelty uh how to
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
report it um any anything in specific
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
having to do with the animal cruelty
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
statutes and enforcing those statutes
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question Madam uh it
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
is a very cursory toour block of
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
instruction that is given to every
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
police recruit uh that goes through the
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
police academy here in New Hampshire
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate that every police
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
officer and the sheriff and the captain
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
both spoke to it we have a single Police
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
Academy every single cop in the state of
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire receives the exact same
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
training uh to that end it's a two-hour
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
block uh it is very cursory it does
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
speak to uh the law that uh uh
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman had brought up
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
relative to uh you know police officers
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
having to bring a vet for know farm
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
animal um but it really just kind of
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
broaches a topic and then it points
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
those police officers to resources that
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
they can call uh it does not really dive
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
into the nitty-gritty of conducting an
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh animal cruelty investigation thank
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby okay um so I
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
think that we've pretty we've covered a
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
lot of the territory in uh and I think
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
that your your testimony is really good
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of pointing to where we need to
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
head with this I think it definitely
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
needs an amendment and I was wondering
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
if you'd be available to help us put put
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
work on that Amendment so that we get
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
what it needs to uh for you to be able
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
to put a uh training course together uh
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and uh certainly We Stand
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
ready to assist uh in any way that we
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
can thank you thank you represent
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you representative Bixby
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question um I
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
was just going to ask the same thing in
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
regards with the amendment piece but my
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
other question would be um in regards
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
when you said having it to law
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement would you also want maybe
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
those numbers decreased um from the
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
state trooper that was talking saying
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know 10 might be too much especially
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
um where they're at um capacity and num
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
you know or not at full capacity of
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
numbers like bringing that down if we
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
were going to have specific in there
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
from 10 to five those types of things um
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to get specific in there
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
besides just opening it up to full law
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement would you be amendable to
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
those types of changes thank you madam
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
for the question uh I think from an
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
operational point of view I would rely
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
on my partners I would rely on the chief
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
I would rely on I checked that the
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff uh rely on the captain and and
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs to to Really weigh
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
in on that I think something that's
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
Global that needs to be also considered
 
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
is that uh there is vacancy rates that
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
the captain spoke to but those vacancy
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
rates are uh anecdotally across the
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
state right now and so uh what we find
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
is that when when agencies are underst
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
staffed it's more difficult for those
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to send their people to
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
training I anticipate just based on the
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
the notion that this
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
is these cases are like drug cases
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
they're they're pretty in-depth you
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
really have to know what you're talking
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
about and you have to have a lot of
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts kind of taking
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
part in these things I I don't
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate that this training would be
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
less than a week long quite frankly uh
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with you know uh all of the farm
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
animals that could be involved with this
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
and domestic animals as well so uh I
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
would certainly defer to uh my partners
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to whether there should be
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
any numbers in here or whether it should
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
speak more to the notion of uh creating
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
a Statewide task force that's managed by
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
and then fill in the blank uh that could
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh and then we could we could get uh
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
police officers Troopers uh Deputy
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
sheriffs that are interested in this
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
topic area and have a lot of subject
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
matter expert they they're GNA they're
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to uh come to this right if you
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
build it they will come and I do think
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
that it opens the pool of candidates if
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
you just kind of you know instead of
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
identifying sheriffs and and State
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
Police really kind of open it up um and
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
I think that might be an alternative
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
consideration to what's in front of us
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
today okay would you consider perhaps um
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
rather than a two-hour
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
cursory instruction that's given to all
 
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
cursory instruction that's given to all
law

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement that that be expanded to be
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in depth uh so that
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement has adequate
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
training in how to identify how to
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
report how to do whatever they need to
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
do uh within the law enforcement
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
capacity uh in in animal cruelty cases
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question Madam uh
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
presently the New Hampshire Police
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
Academy is 16 weeks in length uh We've
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
engaged the services of uh outside vent
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
to conduct a job task analysis for
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
police officers first year to fifth year
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
with regard to those things that they
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
really need to know when they exit the
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
academy uh that uh survey and uh data
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Gathering is is happening as we speak uh
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that the length of the
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
academy will probably need to be
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
expanded uh we are a little bit under
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
the national average in terms of time
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
spent at the police academy and I can
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
tell you for a topic that is as
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
important as this one uh there are about
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
120 other topics that are equally
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
important that those police officers
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
have to uh receive training on and uh we
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
are fighting uh the these different
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
entities are fighting for uh an hour uh
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
here and there uh and so we really have
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
to rely on the data that's going to be
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
collected through the job task analysis
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
for us to really uh dial down and look
 
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
at how we um provide value to the
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
recruit as they go through the academy
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're touching on all of
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
those things they need to know am I
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to expanding that training no uh
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
not at all uh and that would be
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact that we need
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
may need to expand training in other
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
areas as well so does law enforcement
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
already engage in say like continuing
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
education where they have to get you
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
know certain hours of training to qu a
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
refresh whatever um what about adding uh
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
course and continuing education for
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty issues thank you for that
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
question Madam uh the captain spoke to
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
the annual inservice training
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have now uh
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
presently we have 24 hours of inservice
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
training that is required every year
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
plus an extra four hours of use of force
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
training uh of those 24 hours of
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
continuing education that's required
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
annually for the police officer to
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
maintain their
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
certification uh they are required to
 
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
complete what we call the three twos the
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
three twos are ethics deescalation and
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh cultural uh uh sensitivity uh bias
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
training and procedural Justice uh each
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
one of those blocks of instruction is
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
two hours in length uh and then we also
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
have one hour that is required for every
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
police officer to uh take uh regarding
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
um post-traumatic stress syndrome and so
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh the remaining hours can be any hour
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
that the chief executive law enforcement
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
officer sees fit for their agency uh
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example I was a police
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
officer in Ry uh we would uh enforce a a
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
fair number of fishing game laws because
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
we were right on the beach people were
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
taking Lobsters by hand and so training
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
in that area might serve that Community
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
right uh maybe a different Community
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
might want to Center their uh their
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
training on something different
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh that could be considered mandatory
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
training uh certainly would have to be
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
captured by either statute or um uh
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
through administrative rule uh there
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
again uh to the captain's point you know
 
01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639 align:start position:0%
there's there's so many different topics
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
that police officers have to stay on top
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
of throughout their career um that uh
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know are we going to see required
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
training on just a whole number of
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
topics that will come out I don't know
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh but certainly that that could be
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
considered a venue to do it thank you
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
director skipper for taking my question
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
just to these are great ideas but to
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
drill down on what you said in your
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
testimony about the monies your
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the monies don't exist
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
right now for the trainings and you
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
would have to get that money allocated
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
to you by the finance committee thank
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
wheeler and that is correct I just want
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh financially uh If
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
This Were to pass that uh financially
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
and operationally from my point of view
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
I would be able to engage the services
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
of those subject matter experts I don't
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
know what if any costs might be provided
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh or or necessitated to to put this
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
together thank you thank you any other
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee representa
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair um are you
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
aware of any New Hampshire Statewide
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
task force we have now for law en
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and um is it considered a
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
success that
 
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
approach uh thank you for the question
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative Scully yes there are a
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
number of task forces uh that uh exist
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the State uh an excellent
 
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
example is the iak task force uh those
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
are uh police officers that are
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
specially trained in um uh finding
 
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%

are specific to their mission uh
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
Regional uh crash investigation units
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
are set up throughout the state those
 
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
can be uh set up by uh local agencies in
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
an area uh by County uh the state police
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%

of using task forces are not unusual to
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement uh we are
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
very lucky in this state that uh
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
agencies work collaboratively throughout
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
the state and and I see that as a as a a
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
way that maybe you could make this
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
operational thank you you're welcome any
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%

are waiting for

report listing potential harms and
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
benefits of the project I will have the
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill uh um introduce the
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill to the committee and then we will
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
take uh a few folks we'll go till
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
noon uh and then I will recess until

will hand it over now to representative
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
ger to introduce our bill thank you
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair honorable
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
westerland I have uh circulated uh my a
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
copy of my written testimony uh which I
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
amended uh I appreciate the chair
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
sending out a copy of it yesterday I
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
made some some brief uh changes and so I
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
I recirculated
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
that under current statute public
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
benefit is defined in very narrow terms
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
does the proposed solid waste facility
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state Solid Waste
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
Management goals and does it meet a need
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
for capacity in the state what current
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
statute does not do and what hb25 seeks
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
to do is cast our decisionmaking in
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
terms of net public benefit none of us
 
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
in our personal lives makes important
 
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
Decisions by drawing up a one-sided list
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
of Pros we do not consider the possible
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
benefits of buying an expensive luxury
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh instead we divide The Ledger
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
into two columns we weigh the possible
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
benefits against the potential harms or
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
disadvantages we weigh the pros and cons
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
why on Earth would we not do the same
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
thing when we are considering whether or
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
not to site a landfill that will impact
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
the community for
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
Generations hb25 does three things first
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
it requires applicants for permits to
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
operate Solid Waste facilities to hire
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
an independent third party to conduct an
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of the potential benefits and
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
potential harms associated with
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
operating a facility in a particular
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
location second it states explicitly
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
that an applicant cannot combine
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
multiple projects as they make their
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
case for potential benefits for example
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
one could not use the possibility of
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
opening a recycling center in location B
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
to support the case for the potential
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
benefits of a landfill in location a the
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
project uh a location needs to be
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated on its own Merit
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
and third hp215 would more precisely
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
Define the term capacity need in statute
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
to say that there is a need an applicant
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
must demonstrate that there will be a
 
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
projected capacity shortfall in the
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
state for at least half the permitted
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
period of the
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
facility I will concentrate my comments
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
on the first of these three changes but
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
I am of course happy to take questions
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
on the other
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
two since the late 1960s the National
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
Environmental Policy act has required
 
01:30:27.629 --> 01:30:27.639 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statements as part
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
of the process of reviewing major
 
01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
government projects such as
 
01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
highways each project proposed must
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
include an environmental impact
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
statement that addresses in detail the
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
social economic and environmental
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
conditions in a proposed location and
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
the potential harms that might be
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
incurred as the American Bar Association
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
explains these statements are quote
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
meant to be a comprehensive
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
decision-making tool for federal state
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
and local policy makers and to inform
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
the public about proposed projects that
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
could affect the environment end quote
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
in addition to potential impacts on the
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
environment for example protected
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
waterways local animal habitat Etc an
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statement must also
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
address quote social and economical
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
impacts to local communities including
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
housing stock business property values
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
in consideration of Aesthetics and noise
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh expected end quote 16 states have
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection acts that
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
require similar environmental impact
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
statements I want to be clear to the
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee hb25 does not propose that New
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pass a similar environmental
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
statute I use these examples uh of these
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
federal and state statutes to show that
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
the methodologies have long existed to
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
do the work that is required in this
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
bill New Hampshire Department of
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services does not have to
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel they have more than
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
five Decades of state and federal
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
practice to draw on as they draft the
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
rules and determine the appropriate
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
methodology for carrying out net public
 
01:32:03.679 --> 01:32:05.109 align:start position:0%
methodology for carrying out net public
benefit

01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
analysis I would like to give one very
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
specific example from de's own work
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
recently presented to this
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee the state's Chief aquatic
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
biologist told the committee that the
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
presence of invasive aquatic species in
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes can lower property
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
values in the area by about 10 to 13
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
% this is one very specific data point
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh that is a perfect example of the kind
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
of information that Dees can use in its
 
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
consideration of net benefit some of the
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
potential harms listed in HB 2115 are
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
easily Quantified in terms of potential
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
economic impact like property values and
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
increased wear on roads others are
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
clearly tangible and easy to identify
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
even if they are harder to place a
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
precise dollar value on
 
01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
such as impact on Recreation tourism and
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
Wildlife all however are vital to the
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
quality of life in our communities and
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
all have been part of the equation for
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
determining environmental impact at the
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
state and federal uh levels for
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
decades it is important to point out
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
that this is not just about
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
Dees above I cited the American Bar
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
association's statement that
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statements serve as
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
a tool both to influence policymaking
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
processes and to form the public when a
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
company applies for a permit to operate
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
a solid waste facility they have the
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
financial resources to hire Consultants
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
to produce reports that make their case
 
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
in the best possible light potential
 
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
host communities rarely have comparable
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
resources to investigate the potential
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
harms that their residents may have to
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
live with literally for
 
01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
Generations the kind of assessment
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
required in this bill would become part
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the public record and give our
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
constituents all the information to
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
which they are entitled about projects
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
that are so consequential for their
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
communities the committee may hear
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
testimony at some point that this bill
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
is somehow unfair to business let's be
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
clear one of the major players in the
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
solid waste industry in New Hampshire
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
has a net worth of more than7 billion
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
dollar as of just a few days ago and
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
another has a net worth of more than $85
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
billion cassella Waste Systems paid the
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
state of M $35 million for the right to
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
operate a state-owned facility at
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
Juniper Ridge uh in that state these
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
companies are asking for the right to
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
operate extraordinarily lucrative
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
businesses in our communities the added
 
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
cost of maybe
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to assure the state and
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
potential host communities that they can
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
provide a genuine public benefit while
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
making enormous profits is not too much
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
to ask I thank you for your time and
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
consideration and and I'm happy to
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
answer questions thank you
 
01:34:55.679 --> 01:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
answer questions thank you
representative

01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
gerana um we have questions from the
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative Miner and then
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative Howard please come sit
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
down thank you m mam chairman thank you
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
testimony am I clear uh when I say that
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
as of now there's no impact statement
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's that that's needed to be uh filed
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
by these um
 
01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
um trash
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
companies thank you for the question
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
right now the question uh about what
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
constitutes benefit is based on what I
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out in my testimony a couple of
 
01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
things does it uh help the state meet
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
its solid waste needs and does it uh
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
meet a capacity needs so that's the
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
question about benefit they certainly do
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
have to you there are air quality
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
permits there are water quality permits
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of sighting
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that do have to be
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
addressed uh what this bill specifically
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
addresses is how we Define a benefit and
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
right now the way we def finded benefit
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
and statute does not require the
 
01:35:59.550 --> 01:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
applicant to demonstrate that in a
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
balance between potential harms and
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
potential benefits that one outweighs
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
the other I understand thank you thank
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um is there
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
a risk of inherent in having the um
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
organization that is wanting to put
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
making the application also make the
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
report of the benefits and and and
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
costs thank you representative Howard uh
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
yes and and this Bill gets at that by
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
requiring that it be a third party that
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
is is contracted to do this work we uh
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
certainly I would have a concern and and
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
would have never proposed a bill that
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
would say that we would ask the
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
applicant to provide that themselves but
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
this would require an independent third
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
party to do that work uh and Dees is
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
very familiar with the landscape of
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
consultants in this area and and would
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
be able to uh you know verify that it is
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
a legitimate independent third party
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here today um
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
our current governor has recently uh
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
signaled a willingness to put the kibos
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
on uh a new landfill up north do you see
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
there being any executive action
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
possibly taken that could make your bill
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
moot in any way thank you for your
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
question representative uh first of all
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
I want to applaud the governor for her
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
statement please I I I would say that uh
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
we should not be discussing any
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
particular project uh I would rather
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
keep our comments regarding uh any
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
particular project any any landfill
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
project uh being considered in the state
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
so please let's not discuss any specific
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
projects in the works thank you madam
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
chair um that I my answer Remains the
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
Same in the sense that no I don't I
 
01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe executive actions in any
 
01:37:53.239 --> 01:37:54.270 align:start position:0%
don't believe executive actions in any
case

01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh would have an impact on what I'm
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
asking to do here this is not about any
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
one project this is saying that when we
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
are citing landfills our current process
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
is inadequate so whether we're citing
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
one within the next five or 10 years or
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
we're citing one 20 or 30 years from now
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh this is a process that needs to be
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
redefined I have a question and so far
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
as would you consider then rather than
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
the applicant
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
requesting or uh submitting
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh some cost benefit analysis or benefit
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
analysis that uh it would be our agency
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
Dees that would contract a third party
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
an independent bunch of eyes to take a
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
look at a
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
particular um project and and come up
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
with that cost benefit analysis uh thank
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I think that's an
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
excellent question if there were an
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that you know made the
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
applicant financially responsible still
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
for paying for for that study stud uh I
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
think that's an excellent suggestion
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
much oh was there one I'm sorry I didn't
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
see your hand representative Scully
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
pardon me I'll put it a little farther
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
this way thank you madam chair um so I
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
assume that if this law is passed it's
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
going to require the whole a whole set
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
of new rules to be created for Dees for
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating these um
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
projects thank you representative yes
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
that is that is if this passes Dees will
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
have to uh adjust the rules they'll have
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
to come up with new rules governing
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
exactly how this process would work uh
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the the bill is designed not to
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
micromanage to dictate uh processes or
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
methodologies uh but to allow Dees to
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
use their judgment and and yes sir they
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
would do that through writing rules
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
Penza just a quick question um
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying are you familiar with um
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
there was a 2023 uh state supreme court
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
decision that basically said that our
 
01:39:59.310 --> 01:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
statute on this is vague and um it
 
01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
needed to be made more sensible and in
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
with that um is this part of the reason
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
why this bill has been put
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
in is that with reference to uh defining
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
need correct yes thank you
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative yes that's important and
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
and that part of this bill is in
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
response to uh Supreme Court decision uh
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
which that Dees uh has within our
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
statutes current currently significant
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
latitude to Define need right so if we
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
say that we have a capacity need well
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
who's to to say what need is uh yes and
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is meant to uh as far as I'm
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
concerned put the legislature in the
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
position that we should be in in
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying statute uh rather than having
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
it so loosely defined and to say which I
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
believe is reasonable that need should
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
mean that uh there is capacity need for
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
at least half of the lifetime of a
 
01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.709 align:start position:0%
at least half of the lifetime of a
permitted

01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
guber M thank you madam chair um the
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
just to clarify need um or you just
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
discussed about for half of the period
 
01:41:11.229 --> 01:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
that they would be permitted that's
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
assuming the need is for the State of
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not neighboring states is
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
that clear that correct thank you very
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
much representative exactly I'm glad
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
that you asked that question statute
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
requires need to be calculated right now
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
based on New Hampshire solid waste needs
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
not the region and as as we've talked
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
about a lot we have become a magnet for
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
trash from around the region because our
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
regulations are are well behind those
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
states around us so yes I'm glad you
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
clarified that statute requires that
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
need be based upon New Hampshire solid
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
waste needs follow thank you followup uh
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
and right now what is the uh capacity
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
from other states that we're taking in
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
meeting their need currently do you know
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
currently and and it varies from year to
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
year I believe and Dees may be able to
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
clarify this we're in the range of about
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
45% we've gone back from year to year
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
between about 45 and 50% of what we
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
landfill coming from out of state thank
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
you okay okay thank you so much for
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill I know how much
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
you enjoy talking
 
01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.550 align:start position:0%
you enjoy talking
trash

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
true uh we we are we are coming uh up on
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
15 minutes to a heart break for lunch um
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
but I will invite uh Dees uh uh director
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
Michael whimet to come and speak on this
 
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
minutes and then what I will do is
 
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
2:30 uh no 1:30 we have another bill
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
scheduled so I will give that bill an
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
hour and then um we'll have have at 2:30
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
we would continue discussing uh or
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony on this bill okay
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay good morning uh uh Mike B record
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
Mike whims director of the waste
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
management division I'm happy to be here
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
to testify relative to House Bill 215
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
now the agency is not taking position on
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um we acknowledge that current
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
law doesn't provide a directive for Dees
 
01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
to consider all potential harms or
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
benefits that might be associated with
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
citing an operation of a landfill uh the
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
department believes that some mechanism
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
for a broader consideration of these
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
potential impacts is worthy of
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
consideration um as representative
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
jamana indicated in his introduction to
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
the bill um the current law Provisions
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
direct Dees to make a determin of public
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
benefit when considering a landfill
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
permit application and those Provisions
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
set out the criteria for the Department
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
to use when making that determination
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
the aspects of public benefit relative
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
to determining whether a proposed
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
facility will address a waste disposal
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
capacity need has been the subject as
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative Jam indicated of Prior
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
appeals and and and that have gone to
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court um the
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
court has provided the department with
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
some clear Guidance with respect to that
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we we
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
this bill would significantly alter the
 
01:44:28.589 --> 01:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
criteria for public benefit relative to
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
capacity need determination and it could
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
potentially we think constrain
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
permitting in a way that um may not
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
allow adequate pass capacity to be
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
permitted and there and um we believe
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
the current law and the Court's guidance
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
um provide Dees with appropriate
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
latitude to make responsible public
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
benefit determinations with respect to
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
capacity that will achieve the broad
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
statutory goals um so stepping away from
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
that for a moment over the years Dees
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
has heard Express from both the
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
regulated Community the the folks
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
seeking permits and Community Advocates
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
and others um an interest in having um a
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
two-step process for considering
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
landfill applications one where in the
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
initial step or stage um the issue of
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
public benefit would be evaluated and
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
determination made um and also certainly
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
potentially in the context of this bill
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to look at broader
 
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
Community impacts both public both
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and harms that might be
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
associated with a proposed facility um
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
we uh there are some states that do that
 
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
and um we think that is worthy of some
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
consideration we know that um it can be
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
frustrating for all parties to be trying
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
to look at the whole landscape the whole
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
the sighting issues the public benefit
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
all the technical criteria all at once
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
when addressing opposed and pending
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
landfill application so um it it may be
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
that some kind of initial phase where
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
there's a consideration of the public
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
benefit as well as those other broader
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
considerations and then a decision made
 
01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
so that if it's a no at that point
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
nobody has to work on it anymore and if
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's a yes at that point it goes to the
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
normal permitting processes across the
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
department and um we uh we believe that
 
01:46:18.589 --> 01:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
could work in New Hampshire um I've had
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
some discussions with the sponsor about
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
possibly you know the need and the value
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
in studying that and trying to determine
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
what that would look like and how that
 
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
would work I would note that um the
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
department while we think we are very
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
well equipped to to implement the
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
current statutory regimen for permitting
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh we have the expertise and and the
 
01:46:41.589 --> 01:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
resources to do a workmanlike job of
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
that um we don't believe that we're uh
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
really staffed or have the expertise to
 
01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
look at some of these individually and
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
and unilaterally look at some of these
 
01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:55.719 align:start position:0%
broader concerns such as um you know
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
economic impacts uh property values uh
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
Recreation Transportation issues you
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
know outside the in the in the region or
 
01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
in the community and so that first stage
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
if there were to be one like that could
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
be one that was peopled with additional
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
experts um who would be able to weigh in
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
on those topics and give a reasonable
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
and fair evaluation of those broader
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
considerations so with that um that
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
that's the nature of where we're at on
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
this right now and I'm I'm happy to take
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
chair thank you director whimet so we
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
tried the two-step process last time
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
around and it's my recollection that the
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
department wasn't in favor of it so you
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you know a first step if
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
it didn't meet the criteria we wouldn't
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
need to go forward which was part of our
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
effort last time so I'm confused right
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
well um you know I think there were
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
aspects to that bill that we were not
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um and I'm talking
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
about a concept and an approach now that
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
I think is worthy of some study um you
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
know I can't say right now I know what
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
it should exactly look like or what
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
would work but I think studying it is is
 
01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
is a worthy worthy Endeavor at this time
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Penza and then
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative grber thank you madam
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
chair following up on representative has
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
Haskins that actually was my bill and
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
um and hearing the positive factions of
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
this when Dees came out in in strong
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
opposition actually I had a employ a
 
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with an employee that was
 
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
all for it until um until they were
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
particular bill yeah I want to
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
understand how you can testify saying
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
that that's something that you guys
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
would consider when you came out
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
strongly against it it just seems like
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking out of both sides of our
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
miles I I don't hear a question there so
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to respond to that
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I don't think that that's an
 
01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:56.189 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I don't think that that's an
appropriate

01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:48:56.199 --> 01:48:57.910 align:start position:0%
appropriate
question

01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:02.679 align:start position:0%
um if you can reframe it to uh you know
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
kind of something else pertaining to the
 
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
bill okay so try to explain to me how
 
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
now it's something that you're positive
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
against when you guys came out full
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
force against it before and now saying
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's something that you consider study
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
when that wasn't even on the radar at
 
01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.270 align:start position:0%
when that wasn't even on the radar at
all

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
through multiple hours of research and
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that I did my testimony this
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
morning is informed by a conversation
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
with the bill sponsor and and we stand I
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
stand by the testimony I'm providing
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
Gruber thank you uh CH uh Madam chair
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
um uh thanks for taking this question do
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the proposed
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
enhanced solid waste facility permitting
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
process that this bill oses um that
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
includes the net public benefit um
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
assessment has some elements or enhances
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
the process so it's close to the mission
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
of a Dees as well was and and second
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
part is the capacity of Dees to do this
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
future as I've testified uh the the
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
agency believes that there it is
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to look at broader
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
considerations than are currently
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
provided you we have clear Direction on
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
what we can consider and what we should
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
be considering to inform a permit
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
decision right now and it does not
 
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
include some of those broader
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
considerations we believe that those are
 
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to look at and as I've
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
testified this morning we believe there
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
may be a framework for doing
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
so okay any other
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative Scully thank
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so um if I understood
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly you don't have
 
01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
people on your staff who have the
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
expertise to look at some of these other
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
issues the economic impact issues or use
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
issues um would it in order for you to
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
be able to fulfill your mission to
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
evaluate would you be training your
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
existing people in some of these areas
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
or you do you need to bring in outside
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
subject matter areas uh
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
experts it's my sense that from the from
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill and from the
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
broader considerations that are being
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
discussed that that folks who have made
 
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
it their career and their and their
 
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
vocation to evaluate those things with
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
the things that are the folks who should
 
01:51:26.669 --> 01:51:26.679 align:start position:0%
be evaluating it Dees is staffed with
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
engineers and geologists and
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
environmental scientists whose expertise
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
is evaluating um design and um potential
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
impacts on the environment groundwater
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
surface water soil that a particular
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
activity might um might impose they are
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
not trained and have not made their
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
careers in making those you know
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
evaluating Transportation impacts or or
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
noise or property value and I think that
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
there are other experts out there that
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
would could be involved in the process
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
that would provide that expertise in a
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
way that Dees isn't really equipped to
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
do representative kto had a question
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question I'm just
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
looking at a portion of the change here
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
um it says uh the impacts may include
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to skip over a lot um that
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
you are to include the emissions from
 
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
transport of solid waste related
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
material and byproducts to and from the
 
01:52:27.239 --> 01:52:28.550 align:start position:0%
material and byproducts to and from the
proposed

01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.149 align:start position:0%
proposed
facility

01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
now that to me is a pretty broad
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
statement and my question is is how
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
would anybody be able to do that study
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
because we don't know who because you
 
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
have you know your neighbors going to
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
the facility you have outside sources
 
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
driving how would you handle that how
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
would that be be able to be done because
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's you don't know who's coming and
 
01:52:59.709 --> 01:52:59.719 align:start position:0%
going and you don't know what type of
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're driving Etc I mean is
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
there could you just elaborate on that a
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
little bit for me sure I think that you
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
know to the extent of study we're
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
required to look at those issues um
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
studies like that of that ilk are done a
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
lot they they use assumptions they use
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
as much information about the proposed
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
activity you know in terms of location
 
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
what type of waste it's likely to bring
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
in and where that waste is likely to
 
01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
come from they can make reasonable
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions to report and and obviously
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
anything that's provided is going to be
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
a a a professional estimate but it's
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
going to be an estimate um and and and
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
so there are ways to do that what I'm
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
what I'm really pointing out is that and
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's an area where you know Dees has
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
done some work on climate change issues
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
on Transportation impacts on climate
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
change that may be an area where Dees
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
has actually got some expertise to look
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
at that um some of these other areas
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
like broader Transportation issues and
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
traffic and economic impacts that I
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't think were really um uh staffed up
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
and with the expertise to address those
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
issues okay thank you very much thank
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
you uh question representative wheeler
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
and then representative H Haskins thank
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
chair do you think that given those
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
concerns and the fact that Dees might
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
not be able to incur Transportation
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
traffic and economic concerns that other
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
departments in this you does this work
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
or yeah okay speak up all right they
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
cheaped out on the mics that's not my
 
01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.189 align:start position:0%
cheaped out on the mics that's not my
fault

01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
fault
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
but do you think that director given the
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
fact that you don't have expertise in
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
your department according to your
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
testimony on Transportation traffic
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
economic concerns that a way to work
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
around that for this legislation would
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
be to put those under the perview of
 
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
departments in the state government that
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
would have to do with Transportation
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
traffic economic concerns others which
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
would have those expertise so you
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to Sure worry about that
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure and and it's conceptual what I've
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
described but I think that you know a an
 
01:55:04.069 --> 01:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
initial body looking at some of those
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
broader concerns could be peopled with
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
you know for example a person from the
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation or a person
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
from the Bureau of uh of uh business
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs or something like that
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
or or or outside experts I mean I think
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
it would be up that and I think that's
 
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the conversation I had
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
with representative J was um you know
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
what would that group look like how
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
would it be staffed and and what and and
 
01:55:31.069 --> 01:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
what criteria would they need to use to
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
make their decision this this bill lays
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
out the kinds of things that a study
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
will look at but it really doesn't say
 
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
anything about how to measure them
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
against one another uh and that's where
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's where it's
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
difficult for those things because
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're not something you can just put a
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
a number on and say it's either above
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
the number or below the number they're
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're a little bit more subjective
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
than that but that I think is what this
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill is asking is to take a look at
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
those broader concerns measure them
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
measure the the the perceived um impacts
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
that are negative against the perceived
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
impacts that are positive and make a
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
decision about whether in the language
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill a net public benefit um
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
results from citing a facility and
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
presumably that's how what a decision
 
01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
hinges on and so this that's why I think
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
a study committee is necessary because
 
01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not easy it's it's a very
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
difficult thing
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
um it's going to if it's not done well
 
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to um probably engender a lot
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
of appeals and a lot of uh controversy
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
um but if it's done well you can still
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
have appeals that's always going to be
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
part of the landscape but um at least
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
you've got some basis and you got the
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
right people in the room making a reason
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
decision using some guidance that's
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
provided by this
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
body okay um yeah sure followup let's
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
make it quick I know but uh
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
so your testimony is that you support a
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
study committee on figuring out this
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
issue amending this legislation to make
 
01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
it a study committee would be your
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
testimony that's the nature of the
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with representative
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
jamman yes representative H Haskins
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
director whimet I don't want to lose the
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
forest for the trees this
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
conversation um has detailed to it in
 
01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
terms of whether we could pull in other
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
departments that are already uh in house
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
like do to give us some um expertise and
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
the party the Independent party third
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
party agent that would write this report
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
would also be doing some of that um I
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
imagine that your department with
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
environmental science uh background and
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
um hydrogeology can read that report
 
01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.390 align:start position:0%
um hydrogeology can read that report
effectively

01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
effectively
um

01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
again the purpose of the bill is to take
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
a look at the other side of the coin
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we haven't really examined that
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
these projects may have far-reaching
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
impact on our
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
communities and on our bodies of water
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the main point of the
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
bill um I would personally hate to see
 
01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
it go off to a study committee because
 
01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:25.639 align:start position:0%
I think the time is urgent and I'd like
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
to see us move forward with this Bill
 
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.910 align:start position:0%
to see us move forward with this Bill
thank

01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
you I guess that was a statement it was
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a question supposed to be
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
yes you do understand I feel certain
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
that the main point of the bill is to
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
study the harms this cost benefit
 
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
analysis has been going on in
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
departments federally for years so I
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable do you feel comfortable
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
that we could get that expertise to put
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
into this examination by the independent
 
01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:02.390 align:start position:0%
into this examination by the independent
third

01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
party um I'm sure an independent third
 
01:59:08.189 --> 01:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
party could be could be OB hired and and
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
contracted with to do the analysis as
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
was indicated by another questioner this
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
morning there's always going to be a
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
concern that any party hired by the
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
applicant is going to you they're going
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
to there will be folks who will question
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
the um whether that's their analysis is
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
unbiased or not so I think that where
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
the really the import of the decision is
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
going to hinge on who's sitting at the
 
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
table evaluating that information and
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
then making a decision about whether a
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
project moves forward or not and that's
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
where I think you need to have people
 
01:59:44.669 --> 01:59:44.679 align:start position:0%
who are um experts in the areas that
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're evaluating quick followup if I
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
may no I we uh We've Come to noon and
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
unless you want to to uh continue
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
through and and and infringe on our time
 
01:59:58.109 --> 01:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
to have lunch no I don't I just want I
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
would watching I would ask if uh
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
director whimet may be able to return uh
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
later today at 2:30 uh so that we can uh
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
continue to uh I ask questions I will I
 
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
will arrange my schedule so I can be
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
here at 2:30 okay thank you so then when
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh call recess on this bill
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
until 2:30 this afternoon
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%

our representative Tom Manion welcome to
environment

03:04:59.389 --> 03:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture thank you madam chair and
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
the committee uh so this is a real quick
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear what this bill
 
03:05:08.550 --> 03:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't do is it doesn't remove licenses
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't remove
 
03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine um proof it doesn't remove the
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
the court uh fine that may come with not
 
03:05:17.950 --> 03:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
licensing your dog and then it also
 
03:05:19.950 --> 03:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh remove anything to do with
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
the rabbit dogs or nuisance dogs that
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
would also get scooped up all I wanted
 
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill was to address a
 
03:05:27.790 --> 03:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
concern from a constituent of mine who
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
um was in the middle of deliberations
 
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
with our our town clerk because their
 
03:05:34.630 --> 03:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
dog could not receive a vaccine for
 
03:05:36.349 --> 03:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
health issues every time it's very old
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
and every time it would go get the
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine it would be like
 
03:05:40.590 --> 03:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
paralyzed for a day had medical
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
conditions it was trying to work that
 
03:05:43.630 --> 03:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
out so she's working that out between
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
the vet and the town and the automated
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
process where like she didn't file her
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
she didn't get it in in time uh sent
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
over a letter from the town clerk's
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
office to the board of Selectmen and one
 
03:05:55.950 --> 03:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
of the Selectmen was she had a temper
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
tantrum when she saw that what the RSA
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
says is that they can send police to
 
03:06:03.790 --> 03:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
your house to kidnap your dog over $25
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
late fee there's already a financial
 
03:06:07.389 --> 03:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
penalty they can discharge it to dis
 
03:06:09.870 --> 03:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
district court if you chose not to uh
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
pay pay your uh penalty to the town um
 
03:06:15.070 --> 03:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
but it's like so it's like
 
03:06:17.190 --> 03:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
46614 has this entire component where
 
03:06:19.630 --> 03:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
they can ual warrant where uh men with
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
guns can break in come into your house
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
and take your family member away from
 
03:06:25.469 --> 03:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
you and then you will if you were
 
03:06:26.910 --> 03:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
already like having trouble paying for
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
that fee before to get your family
 
03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
member back you now have to pay for the
 
03:06:33.469 --> 03:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
um the you know it's maintained by the
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
facility veter and Veterinary fees that
 
03:06:37.469 --> 03:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
the facility May benefit the dog and
 
03:06:39.990 --> 03:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
these may be paid for by the town uh and
 
03:06:41.469 --> 03:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
then you're on the hook for that before
 
03:06:43.710 --> 03:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
they'll even give you your dog back so
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
that the objective of this goal was to
 
03:06:46.830 --> 03:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the fears of my local
 
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
constituent I man to get all the Reps
 
03:06:50.990 --> 03:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
from pelum and our Senator on this bill
 
03:06:53.550 --> 03:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh because this woman was terrified she
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
did not know that they that this existed
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the law so with that I'm happy to
 
03:06:58.910 --> 03:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you
 
03:06:58.920 --> 03:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you
representative

03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:07:04.750 --> 03:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative for coming today the
 
03:07:06.910 --> 03:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
situation you were talking about is that
 
03:07:09.070 --> 03:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
what would happen if they got the
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine but didn't pay the the the $25
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
fee yeah they also are supposed to send
 
03:07:16.269 --> 03:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
a warning before that for you're
 
03:07:17.389 --> 03:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay the fee from what I
 
03:07:18.190 --> 03:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
understand understand if I'm
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
interpreting this RSA correctly they
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
send you a warning that you're supposed
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
to pay an additional $25 late fee and
 
03:07:24.630 --> 03:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
then anything by I think it's like comes
 
03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh June to 20 June 1st to June 20th it
 
03:07:30.269 --> 03:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
gets uh the board of Selectmen wh
 
03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
whomever will get a list of people that
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
didn't pay that $25 and then they're
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
going to come spend God knows how much
 
03:07:38.030 --> 03:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
money in like police time to come seize
 
03:07:40.469 --> 03:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
your dog and then house it and then pay
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
more money there to house the dog and
 
03:07:43.229 --> 03:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
then if you never pay that fee the
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
town's on the hook for all that money if
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
you never pay it and it's over $25
 
03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
followup followup uh thank you so um you
 
03:07:53.710 --> 03:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of the ability of
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
officers to be able to come and steal
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
your family member what what um would be
 
03:08:00.190 --> 03:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
a solution then because I could imagine
 
03:08:01.710 --> 03:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
people gaming the system and just never
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
paying it I mean should there be a lean
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
on the person's house or what what would
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
ideally would be the solution then to
 
03:08:09.309 --> 03:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
get them to so there's already a there's
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
a the section 13 uh mentions I can read
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
this here so the forfeiture it's a uh
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
you uh if it's not made for made to the
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
town clerk than 15 callor a days or
 
03:08:20.070 --> 03:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
notice of forfeiture the case may be
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
disposed of to District Court as a
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
violation with an additional fine of $50
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
like this already exists in RSA so then
 
03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's up to the courts um I don't know if
 
03:08:30.030 --> 03:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
we need to add more here like this this
 
03:08:31.469 --> 03:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a pretty sufficient so
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
you're already on the hook here for like
 
03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
$75 bare minimum for not paying your
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
original license fee I I just think
 
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
personally this seems egregious that
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to send armed men into
 
03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
your house to kidnap your dog just
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
because you didn't pay $75 basically
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you at at maximum represent
 
03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:50.030 align:start position:0%
thank you at at maximum represent

03:08:52.110 --> 03:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
could you put your mic on
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
please yeah I can hear you but go for it
 
03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manny for
 
03:08:58.429 --> 03:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward whether
 
03:09:00.269 --> 03:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
people think it's necessary or not I do
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
I was faced with a similar situation
 
03:09:06.030 --> 03:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
with the dog that I had um first off
 
03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
again um if this does not eliminate
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccines is that correct that's
 
03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
correct yes that not none of that
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
statute is this is literally sections 14
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
15 16 that all have to do with like
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
issuing a warrant for the seizure of the
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
animal and how to return it do and it
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate the reporting of
 
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccinations correct none of that
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
is is removed can do you know
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative what happens to the
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
animals that are confiscated if the
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
owner does not have the means to pay for
 
03:09:38.349 --> 03:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
that animal yes it's written in here um
 
03:09:39.790 --> 03:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
after which time the title of the dog
 
03:09:41.469 --> 03:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
shall pass to the facility unless the
 
03:09:42.990 --> 03:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
owner of the dog has before the
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
expiration of the period caused the dog
 
03:09:46.510 --> 03:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
to be licensed so then it's up to the uh
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
Town it'll be hand it over to the
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
facility so representative do you think
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
that means that that particular animal
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be in a shelter as opposed
 
03:09:57.309 --> 03:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
to being in a home yes and and God knows
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
some shelters maybe kill
 
03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
shelters I'm not even going to speak sex
 
03:10:03.870 --> 03:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know any in the it's up to the
 
03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
facility owner thank you representative
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh for being here and bringing this to
 
03:10:11.279 --> 03:10:12.229 align:start position:0%
uh for being here and bringing this to
our

03:10:12.229 --> 03:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
attention um a couple things um
 
03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
now we know the importance of rabies
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines and we under I understand um
 
03:10:27.150 --> 03:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
that this particular animal uh had
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
basically an allergic reaction uh to the
 
03:10:33.309 --> 03:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
um the rabish vaccine did she try and
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
get an exemption from the state
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian yeah that was uh she was
 
03:10:38.190 --> 03:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
actually going through that I have like
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
the whole email chain here um it was
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
just and there was some kind of like
 
03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
timing issue where like while she was
 
03:10:45.990 --> 03:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
negotiating that something automated in
 
03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
the town system kicked it over to the
 
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
Board of Selectmen with her name on it
 
03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
and that they're friends like the board
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen is friends with this
 
03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
individual so the board of Selectmen
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
lost her mind saying that you know
 
03:10:55.349 --> 03:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
seeing holy crap they're going to go
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
like sees this person's dog that's a
 
03:10:59.550 --> 03:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
friend of mine um I I don't know what
 
03:11:01.389 --> 03:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
the end up the you know the end result
 
03:11:02.670 --> 03:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
of this is but it was like an elderly
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
dog it's like 14 years old doesn't even
 
03:11:05.870 --> 03:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
leave the property so that I understand
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
that getting these exemptions is is a
 
03:11:09.150 --> 03:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
process that they can walk through and
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to take time from what I
 
03:11:13.150 --> 03:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
understand representative com followup
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and thank you
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
for explaining that
 
03:11:22.110 --> 03:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm a little concerned about
 
03:11:25.389 --> 03:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
eliminating everything in in these
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
rsas however I I I agree with you that
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you're already going through the
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
process of obtaining exemption through
 
03:11:35.429 --> 03:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
the state veterinarian office um whether
 
03:11:37.790 --> 03:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's a timing issue or not you're
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
already they're already working on
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
something my problem is is that we know
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
that rabies is a public health issue and
 
03:11:48.150 --> 03:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
there is no cure BAS basically it's
 
03:11:50.830 --> 03:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
death if you get bit by anything
 
03:11:56.389 --> 03:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
rapid um so if you remove the payment
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
portions I just want to it is not
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
removing the payment portions that is
 
03:12:03.150 --> 03:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
section 13 this is
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
14156 which are specifically about
 
03:12:07.630 --> 03:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
seizing the dog with using law
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement section 13 does have the
 
03:12:11.229 --> 03:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
financial penalties it is also the
 
03:12:13.269 --> 03:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
section that uh discharges it to the
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
district court to collect those fines as
 
03:12:17.150 --> 03:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
well I have not touched that well
 
03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
whatever this was a back and forth that
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
I had with OS they thought that's what I
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
wanted all I wanted was the part the 14
 
03:12:24.670 --> 03:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
15 and 16 that deal with the physical
 
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
seizure of the dog via warrant and then
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
how to return it follow one more
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam chair so let me
 
03:12:35.070 --> 03:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
rephrase my question
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay the fee licensing a dog is so that
 
03:12:42.030 --> 03:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
we can have a record of those that have
 
03:12:45.469 --> 03:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
had their shots and up to date on
 
03:12:48.269 --> 03:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
rabies or that have an exemption through
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian if we remove any
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
penalties I don't know how would we
 
03:13:00.269 --> 03:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
address the people that are not doing
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
what is best for the public by getting
 
03:13:06.030 --> 03:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
their dogs with their their rabies shot
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
I don't care about any of the other
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
shots the rabies one is the only one I
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
care about um for Public Policy right
 
03:13:12.399 --> 03:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
care about um for Public Policy right
policy

03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
so what is the um
 
03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
Where Do We Stand uh so as I was saying
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't touch the rabies it
 
03:13:22.990 --> 03:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know the right rabies
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
section I think that's like section one
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh and it doesn't affect licensing
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
rabies it doesn't affect the financial
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
penalty or discharging it to the courts
 
03:13:33.550 --> 03:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
for them to you know get even more
 
03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
penalty Out of You This only affects the
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
part where they come and take the dog it
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't it also doesn't remove the
 
03:13:41.429 --> 03:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
section 31 which has to do with nuisance
 
03:13:43.389 --> 03:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
animals and dog bites and the police at
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
that point can seize the animal I
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
haven't touched that whatsoever that is
 
03:13:48.990 --> 03:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
also still intact this is strictly
 
03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
seizure for failure to pay the
 
03:13:53.229 --> 03:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
registration fee thank you very much
 
03:13:55.229 --> 03:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Bixby and then
 
03:13:58.269 --> 03:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
Howard so um I just pulled up the
 
03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
sections here and uh it looks like uh
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
the way that 46614 is written there is
 
03:14:10.990 --> 03:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
not at at this point uh an exception Pro
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
procedure that could have been follow
 
03:14:15.150 --> 03:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
that could be followed in the situation
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
where basically you're saying that your
 
03:14:19.710 --> 03:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
constituent was just it was a matter of
 
03:14:22.510 --> 03:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
timing rather than lack of willingness
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding yeah so I am I
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
am really hesitant to get rid of the uh
 
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
the capacity for the town to seize a dog
 
03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
for someone from someone who is being
 
03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:34.590 align:start position:0%
for someone from someone who is being
absolutely

03:14:34.590 --> 03:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
intransigent uh however I think that
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
there should be an exception procedure
 
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
so would you be uh would would you be
 
03:14:44.670 --> 03:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
interested in there being an amendment
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
which would add an exception uh uh so
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
that um the town can work with uh give
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
some leniency to people uh if uh if
 
03:14:58.229 --> 03:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
there are extenuating circumstances per
 
03:15:00.269 --> 03:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps like an amendment uh the way I I
 
03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
st it because like there was actually a
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh I spoke to two Town one was a board
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
of selectman from my town and one was an
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
actual town clerk that messaged me and
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
both were surprised that this was here
 
03:15:11.550 --> 03:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
that this existed at all and then when
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
the board of Selectmen from my town
 
03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
talked to The Other Board of Selectmen
 
03:15:16.349 --> 03:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
they were both saying we never actually
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
enforced this we only ever send it as a
 
03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
scare tactic uh and I think it was the
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
molten Boro town clerk that was emailing
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
back and forth of me that she Mis
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted the LSR but she said
 
03:15:28.110 --> 03:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
they've never sent out actual warrants
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
to arrest dogs either so it seems to me
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
that this this seems like a giant scare
 
03:15:35.189 --> 03:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
tactic component to the law where if if
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
we want we should make this much more
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
strict for the requirements for doing
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
something like this like as opposed to
 
03:15:41.710 --> 03:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
just some deadline every year it should
 
03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps be as you describe like repeated
 
03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
negligence uh if that's what the
 
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
amendment should be like four years what
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be like running problems
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
where they just keep falling behind year
 
03:15:53.229 --> 03:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
year over year perhaps but like the way
 
03:15:54.750 --> 03:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
that it seems is like uh especially in
 
03:15:55.710 --> 03:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
my town it sounds like it was just
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
unautomated process the date came they
 
03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
emailed the board of Selectmen here's a
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
list of people to send threatening
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
letters to and then we're not going to
 
03:16:04.830 --> 03:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
actually follow up on
 
03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
it okay so uh follow so the um the way
 
03:16:12.070 --> 03:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's currently phrased the initial
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
sentence says the town or city clerk
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
shall annually between June 1st and June
 
03:16:19.670 --> 03:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
June 20th per the local governing body
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
list of those owners of dogs that have
 
03:16:25.389 --> 03:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
failed to uh to license or not renewed
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
their license pursuant to
 
03:16:33.070 --> 03:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
4661 uh and then uh and then there's the
 
03:16:34.750 --> 03:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
um issuance of the
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
license of the warrant so um I I what
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm thinking is that rather
 
03:16:46.510 --> 03:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
than have it quite so automated there
 
03:16:50.349 --> 03:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
have this as uh something that the town
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
may do uh if if necessary is that
 
03:16:56.189 --> 03:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
something it would be it's a lot better
 
03:16:58.110 --> 03:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
than the current law I mean I'm happy to
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
meet both ways I just know this scared
 
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
the crap out of this board of Selectmen
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
scared the crap out of the dog owner
 
03:17:04.150 --> 03:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
scared the crap out of me as a dog owner
 
03:17:05.790 --> 03:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
like being as forgetful sometimes like
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
you forget to pay things and like God
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
knows if I get like a me letter in the
 
03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
mail saying they're coming to seize my
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
dog I'm going to band down the hatches
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
and get ready for an
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
assault okay representative Howard
 
03:17:20.269 --> 03:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um maybe even more
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
to the point would be to um uh
 
03:17:26.510 --> 03:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
strengthen number 13 where where it goes
 
03:17:28.030 --> 03:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know goes to the court rather than
 
03:17:30.910 --> 03:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
to the selectman so that so and then the
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
court has the de has the opportunity to
 
03:17:35.950 --> 03:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
to say you know is this is an elderly
 
03:17:37.990 --> 03:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
dog or this is a a repeat negligence or
 
03:17:40.349 --> 03:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
something like that and and still allow
 
03:17:42.030 --> 03:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
for those penalties to happen for people
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
who really have gone around the band as
 
03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
far as ignoring the health risk yeah
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
again that's a better better than the
 
03:17:51.790 --> 03:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
current law any other
 
03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Manion um like to
 
03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
Guilford representing the town of Dair
 
03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
town clerk one to two
 
03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
minutes yeah need to put the um U sorry
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
microphone on thank thank you um my name
 
03:18:17.309 --> 03:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
is Tina Guilford I'm the town clerk in
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
Dairy um we license about close to 7,000
 
03:18:26.910 --> 03:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
dogs every year um
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
46613 creates the Civil forfeiture and
 
03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
the Civil penalty and and and that is
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
being kept but the actual issuance of
 
03:18:40.189 --> 03:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
the Civil forfeiture is in 650
 
03:18:43.870 --> 03:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
66414 now we and Derry do not take
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
possession of the dog um it says that
 
03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
the warrant may also authorize a local
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer to seize any
 
03:18:54.990 --> 03:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
unlicensed dog so the warrant in Dar
 
03:18:58.110 --> 03:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
does not authorize seizure of a dog we
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
aren't looking to seize dogs we don't
 
03:19:02.429 --> 03:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
want to take possessions of dogs I will
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that most of the people who do
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
not license on time and there are other
 
03:19:10.389 --> 03:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
statutes prior to this that start the $1
 
03:19:12.990 --> 03:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
a month late fee on June 1st and all of
 
03:19:14.830 --> 03:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
that most people who don't license their
 
03:19:16.750 --> 03:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
dog on time is because they don't have a
 
03:19:18.910 --> 03:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
valid rabies on
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
file I mean we've automated the system
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
in Derry we send out email reminders in
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
January February and
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
March the end of March we send out an
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
actual paper Bill to anybody who hasn't
 
03:19:32.239 --> 03:19:33.389 align:start position:0%
actual paper Bill to anybody who hasn't
still

03:19:33.389 --> 03:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
still
 
03:19:36.269 --> 03:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
licensed and come May 1st starts the
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
grace period we also hold a rabies
 
03:19:42.429 --> 03:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
clinic in town um it's like $15 to get
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
your um dogs rabies uh we do everything
 
03:19:48.790 --> 03:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
we can to try to get people to license
 
03:19:52.349 --> 03:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
their dog and assist them um in that
 
03:19:55.229 --> 03:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
process however there are always people
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
who just don't they forget they don't
 
03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:00.229 align:start position:0%
who just don't they forget they don't
make

03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
appointments and they end up then
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
getting the fine and then they get they
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
call they're really
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
upset um and they always seem to think
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
that they had a reason for allowing the
 
03:20:17.710 --> 03:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
rabies to lapse for this for that that
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
it helps to have a very standardized
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
process that all the towns are kind of
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
using the same process I definitely
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
think that you can take out the um you
 
03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
know taking possession of the dog
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't know that anybody wants
 
03:20:34.429 --> 03:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:20:37.229 --> 03:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
that but the warrant process is what
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
starts the court process um and having
 
03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
gone to court for these kinds of things
 
03:20:44.910 --> 03:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
they always want to know when was the
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
Civil forfeiture issued the issued by
 
03:20:49.830 --> 03:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
certified mail when was it delivered
 
03:20:52.510 --> 03:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
when was it signed for that's all in
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
this warrant process okay and I'll take
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chairman thank
 
03:21:03.150 --> 03:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you know
 
03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
um through the town do you have to
 
03:21:09.070 --> 03:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
register with the state to let the state
 
03:21:12.510 --> 03:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
know that um do we have a Statewide
 
03:21:16.750 --> 03:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine registry no no we do not
 
03:21:20.269 --> 03:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
at this time um I know we uh we get the
 
03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
Raby certificates that we have them our
 
03:21:25.269 --> 03:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and Animal Control has
 
03:21:28.510 --> 03:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
access to our dogs um sometimes we get
 
03:21:30.229 --> 03:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
rabes certificates for people that have
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
recently moved and they forgot to update
 
03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
the address and we try to forward them
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
to the right town but there is no
 
03:21:38.910 --> 03:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide registry that I know of thank
 
03:21:41.790 --> 03:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
you okay representative ktoa thank you
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for coming in
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
and telling us about the process um
 
03:21:50.070 --> 03:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
whereas rabies is a public health issue
 
03:21:52.990 --> 03:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
do you think if people understood and
 
03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe people don't really understand
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
the importance of rabies you think there
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
should be an educational component when
 
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
you send out these forages to say what
 
03:22:02.670 --> 03:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
the liability could be to that person if
 
03:22:04.990 --> 03:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
that dog has rabies and bite someone I
 
03:22:08.309 --> 03:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
mean because to me that would be the
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
scarier part than a $25 fine I agree
 
03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
with you and we definitely put some uh
 
03:22:16.630 --> 03:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
information on the flyer and we do have
 
03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
some information on there I I you can
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
give people information but you can't
 
03:22:23.710 --> 03:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
make them read it and you can't make
 
03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
them understand it thank you any other
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
much I call Angela
 
03:22:35.710 --> 03:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
Ferrari from dog owners of the Granite
 
03:22:40.590 --> 03:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:43.990 --> 03:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
minutes all right this is on okay um
 
03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you madam chair
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:22:50.070 --> 03:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
Angela Ferrari I'm here on behalf of dog
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
owners of the Granite State uh for those
 
03:22:54.269 --> 03:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
of you who are new to the committee I'll
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
do a brief introduction but we are a
 
03:22:57.910 --> 03:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that was
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
established in
 
03:23:01.950 --> 03:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
1991 to represent the interests of all
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
pet owners in New Hampshire um our
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
membership includes a vibrant and active
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
community of specialty breed clubs uh
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
kennel clubs dog and cat breeders
 
03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarians Hunters mushers you name
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
it um we have a really great membership
 
03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
I have been with the organization since
 
03:23:26.670 --> 03:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
2019 our position on h240 is that we do
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill um I think there's been
 
03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of great discussion about the
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerns around rabies and its effect on
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
Public Safety um we are mostly concerned
 
03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
with taking that stick away that is
 
03:23:43.389 --> 03:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
going to push those people to get their
 
03:23:46.830 --> 03:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
rabies uh vaccinations done there's some
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
things I think we have maybe some
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in the room who will speak
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
to it but when you get a rabies vaccine
 
03:23:55.710 --> 03:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
the first one um within a year you need
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
to obtain your second one and then
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
you're good for every 3 years the towns
 
03:24:02.750 --> 03:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
are also monitoring the expiration dates
 
03:24:04.990 --> 03:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
on the rabies vaccines to make sure that
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
you are sticking within that protocol
 
03:24:09.870 --> 03:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
and if you go outside of that then you
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
have to work with your veterinarian to
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
kind of restart the process and that's
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
going to um show as the expiration date
 
03:24:19.830 --> 03:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
on the rabies um that would be submitted
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
to your town so there's a little bit of
 
03:24:25.229 --> 03:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
administrative support um that helps
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
people ensure that they're following the
 
03:24:29.630 --> 03:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
proper protocol for those rabies
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinations um so the loss of control
 
03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
over dog licensing and the implications
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
for public health is definitely a
 
03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
concern for us um as mentioned there is
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
an exemption for those dogs who have
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
health reasons to not obtain the rabies
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine um I do feel and the the
 
03:24:50.990 --> 03:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
membership feels that what we have in
 
03:24:54.269 --> 03:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
statute now really does allow us to
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
enforce that people are receiving those
 
03:24:59.229 --> 03:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccines for their dogs I do
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
agree with uh representative bixby's
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
point about maybe having some leniency
 
03:25:08.830 --> 03:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
if there is um an active exemption being
 
03:25:10.830 --> 03:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
sought through the state vet and if
 
03:25:12.510 --> 03:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
there is some type of proof that could
 
03:25:14.910 --> 03:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
be provided to the town clerk that would
 
03:25:17.790 --> 03:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
prevent um the the actual seizure of the
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
animal and that fee from happening um
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
but I do think as we've heard from
 
03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
others that that fee and that seizure is
 
03:25:28.189 --> 03:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
kind of what's going to drive those
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to avoid getting
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccination for their dog um
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
additionally something that I think
 
03:25:38.189 --> 03:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's important that is kind of a
 
03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
byproduct of this process with dog
 
03:25:42.670 --> 03:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
licensing and getting that rabies
 
03:25:45.189 --> 03:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine well there are clinics that you
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
can get your vaccine at a lot of people
 
03:25:49.790 --> 03:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be doing their annual well
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
checks with their animals ahead of
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
getting their dog license making sure
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're up to dat on their rabies um so
 
03:25:59.189 --> 03:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
I think we get an extra benefit while
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
not included in the law that people are
 
03:26:04.670 --> 03:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
actually taking their dogs to the vet um
 
03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and having them checked out this is when
 
03:26:09.269 --> 03:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians or are going to be
 
03:26:11.469 --> 03:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
considering other vaccinations that are
 
03:26:13.710 --> 03:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
important for the dogs although not
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
mandated by the state um parvo and
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
distemper are some of those that we'll
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
see come up and we do see that those
 
03:26:22.750 --> 03:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
diseases are making their way more
 
03:26:25.189 --> 03:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
rapidly into New Hampshire um so
 
03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
anything we can do that's kind of
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
assisting getting the general public to
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
get their animals into the veterinarian
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
I think is also an added bonus that the
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
current RSA is helping to provide
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
something else you know it was touched
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
on that um mostly it's people who just
 
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to get the vaccine you know
 
03:26:49.189 --> 03:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
or you know $25 they might be avoiding
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to pay for it especially if they
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
have multiple dogs each dog needs to be
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
licensed and vaccinated um that's
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
something that I think dog owners need
 
03:27:02.030 --> 03:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility for and do for
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
their dogs a lot of people will say my
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
dog's never going to get exposed to
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
rabies he stays in the yard he's fine
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
but you never know when that animal is
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
going to come to the property it could
 
03:27:15.910 --> 03:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
even meet you on the street as you're
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
walking down the road the animals that
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
have the rabies they're very strange
 
03:27:22.750 --> 03:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
acting they do things out of the
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
ordinary so I think we need to continue
 
03:27:27.150 --> 03:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
to urge and enforce that people are
 
03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
going to be getting those
 
03:27:30.830 --> 03:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines um with that I would take any
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:33.469 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
Boer representing yourself and uh two
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and committee
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
members my name is Dr Lisa Boer I am a
 
03:27:54.309 --> 03:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licensed veterinarian with
 
03:27:56.110 --> 03:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
over two decades of experience in
 
03:27:57.790 --> 03:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
emergency and critical care and general
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
practice I am in strong opposition to
 
03:28:03.070 --> 03:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
hb24 as currently written the
 
03:28:04.990 --> 03:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination of dogs against rabies is
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
the Cornerstone of Public Health
 
03:28:08.590 --> 03:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
protection and we do know several things
 
03:28:11.309 --> 03:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
for certain rabies is a serious disease
 
03:28:13.870 --> 03:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
and 100% fatal in both animals and
 
03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
humans it is also that known that the
 
03:28:19.590 --> 03:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine is virtually 100% effective in
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
prevention of this disease rabies is
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
zoonotic meaning it is transmitted
 
03:28:25.710 --> 03:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
through the bite or scratch of an
 
03:28:27.990 --> 03:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
infected animal it is deadly and there
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
is no cure in the United States
 
03:28:32.950 --> 03:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 people die from rabies
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
annually in 2023 despite appropriate
 
03:28:38.429 --> 03:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
immediate rabies prophylaxis treatment
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
after a bite we still had deaths from
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
treatment or from rabies in New
 
03:28:46.229 --> 03:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 20 to 30 animals or more test
 
03:28:49.070 --> 03:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
positive for rabies every year without
 
03:28:50.670 --> 03:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
strict vaccination protocols and
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of civil fines for
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
non-compliance we leave ourselves
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to a potential Public Health
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
crisis I personally have a dog who has
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
an exemption to rabies for vaccine he
 
03:29:02.269 --> 03:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
has an autoimmune disorder cannot be
 
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I took it upon myself to go
 
03:29:06.750 --> 03:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
get the exemption from the state vet I
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
can't write it myself I managed to get
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
my license on time it takes planning but
 
03:29:15.150 --> 03:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
it is very easy to do if you have a true
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
problem with the vaccine
 
03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
I see te several types of pet owners
 
03:29:21.189 --> 03:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
those who believe in vaccination and
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
those who feel it poses a risk for their
 
03:29:25.389 --> 03:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
pet despite scientific research to the
 
03:29:27.870 --> 03:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
contrary the rabies vaccine is a killed
 
03:29:30.269 --> 03:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
virus and is safe in almost every dog or
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
cat with some exceptions without laws
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
and Licensing a substantial number of
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
pet owners would not vaccinate their
 
03:29:38.189 --> 03:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
pets thereby increasing the risks of
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
occurrence of this disease in both the
 
03:29:42.070 --> 03:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
pet and human population I have this
 
03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
discussion with clients weekly I see
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
pets and people almost that have been
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
bitten or scratched by cats and dogs
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
when a bite wound occurs from an
 
03:29:52.269 --> 03:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated or unknown animal it places
 
03:29:54.070 --> 03:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on the bite or scratch
 
03:29:56.349 --> 03:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
victim they have to seek costly Medical
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
Care and potentially they need rabies
 
03:29:59.910 --> 03:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
prophylaxis treatment which is upwards
 
03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:00.870 align:start position:0%
prophylaxis treatment which is upwards
of

03:30:00.870 --> 03:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
$20,000 the treatment increases um this
 
03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
the lack of vaccination increases risk
 
03:30:08.469 --> 03:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
to Veterinary staff members and in some
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
cases causes us to have to euthanize and
 
03:30:12.670 --> 03:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
decapitate an animal and send the head
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
in for testing because there is no
 
03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
premortem testing
 
03:30:17.950 --> 03:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
there are risks in addition to the pain
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
and suffering of the pet who through no
 
03:30:21.269 --> 03:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
fault of its own was not vaccinated and
 
03:30:24.349 --> 03:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
not protected this build as I read it
 
03:30:25.630 --> 03:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
does not just remove the language
 
03:30:27.870 --> 03:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with the forfeiture of the pet
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it removes civil forfeiture which
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
should mean fines for non-compliance
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
this bill effectively eliminates all
 
03:30:36.229 --> 03:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
penalty for non-compliance penalties are
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
a necessary deterrent the laws are Not
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
Mere suggestions they're binding rules
 
03:30:41.469 --> 03:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
for the Public's well-being when
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
penalties are in place they create an
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
incentive for people to follow the law
 
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that there are real consequences
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
removing them signals to society that
 
03:30:51.150 --> 03:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
compliance is not truly necessary for
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
example driving Under the Influence
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
regulations are designed to protect
 
03:30:56.229 --> 03:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
lives if we remove penalties would
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
people take it seriously would we expect
 
03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
people to voluntarily follow those rules
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
knowing there are no consequences for
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
Dangerous Behavior the answer to me is
 
03:31:06.070 --> 03:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
clear without penalties the motivation
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
to comply decreases and the public
 
03:31:10.429 --> 03:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
safety is jeopardized the risk to Public
 
03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
Health from rabies cannot be overstated
 
03:31:14.790 --> 03:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
even if it's rare in some regions the
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
consequences of a single Cas is
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and the threat is always
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
present if we eliminate fines for
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
failure to vaccinate we risk undermining
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
A system that is successfully protected
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
both human and animal populations for
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
decades furthermore enforcing the Civil
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
forfeiture incentivizes responsible pet
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
ownership it ensures that the people
 
03:31:35.070 --> 03:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of vaccination
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
for their pets health and the well-being
 
03:31:39.189 --> 03:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
of that of them and their neighbors if
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
we remove the finds that signals
 
03:31:42.469 --> 03:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
non-compliance is acceptable which would
 
03:31:44.790 --> 03:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
lead to fewer dogs being vaccinated more
 
03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
potential exposure and mely more human
 
03:31:48.990 --> 03:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
cases of rabies and I'll be happy to
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
03:31:54.990 --> 03:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
chair one could you pass your testimony
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh up to the clerk perfect thank you uh
 
03:32:02.030 --> 03:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
and you have an exemption through the
 
03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian um one how difficult
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
was it get and when a dog is exempt what
 
03:32:10.590 --> 03:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
are the requirements for it to go
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
outside okay good question um and those
 
03:32:16.189 --> 03:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
are some very really important issues
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
the exemption itself requires you to go
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
and have a certification by a board
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
certified specialist in this state this
 
03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
is different there are I'm licensed in
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
several States some require just a note
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
from your veterinarian but you I had to
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
take my dog to a specialist who then was
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
willing to sign the waiver based on
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
knowing my pet and knowing the condition
 
03:32:37.630 --> 03:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
that they had I then submit that waiver
 
03:32:40.030 --> 03:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
to my town Brentwood and I get my
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
license for my dog there are
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that if my dog leaves the
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
property he should be muzzled he must be
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
muzzled that is the prop that is what we
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
have to do so we are in in my case my
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
dog was a service dog and then he got
 
03:32:55.950 --> 03:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
six he's no long a service dog so it's
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
difficult you know for me I have to
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
muzzle them when I go out but I do so
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:33:05.790 --> 03:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
vixy so um would you be uh how would you
 
03:33:08.349 --> 03:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
feel about uh making a minor Amendment
 
03:33:11.550 --> 03:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
to the law that would give the town
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
discretion uh in terms of sending the um
 
03:33:19.950 --> 03:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
sending the the Civil forture warning uh
 
03:33:24.309 --> 03:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
and uh and and warrant uh so that if
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
there is someone who is in the process
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
of working with the town to uh get the
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
get the appropriate vaccination and
 
03:33:34.229 --> 03:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
licensure then they don't automatically
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
get that
 
03:33:38.110 --> 03:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
warning I I have no problem with having
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
discretion I think we need to rely on
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
our you know people that work in the
 
03:33:43.710 --> 03:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
towns and to do what's in the best
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
interest of you know the people who live
 
03:33:48.790 --> 03:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
there however um my question is would be
 
03:33:52.349 --> 03:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
back to that is that how long do we let
 
03:33:54.189 --> 03:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
that go on you know I mean it didn't
 
03:33:55.950 --> 03:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't take that long to get an
 
03:33:57.550 --> 03:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
exemption if a true one is needed the
 
03:33:59.469 --> 03:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
problem that I see and what I've seen
 
03:34:01.389 --> 03:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
most often is people apply for the
 
03:34:03.070 --> 03:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
exemption and they're not granted the
 
03:34:05.070 --> 03:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
exemption and they don't like it because
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
they think that their pet still
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have a vaccine and then they
 
03:34:11.670 --> 03:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
just ignore it perpetually so it's very
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to get an in in the sense of
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
you can't just say my pets had a
 
03:34:17.189 --> 03:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
reaction and I'm not going to vaccinate
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
it again it would mean as me as if I
 
03:34:20.910 --> 03:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a pet that I vaccinate that has a
 
03:34:23.030 --> 03:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
reaction to That vaccine I would there
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
are other Alternatives you can pre-treat
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
that that pet with you know an
 
03:34:28.349 --> 03:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
antihistamine and other things it would
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
be a professional Judgment of how to
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
manage to get that pet vaccinated safely
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
but if you can't do it like in my dog's
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
case there is no way to vaccinate him
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
safely I think there should be the
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
exemption and it should be something
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
that you know the the veterinarian that
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
a treating veterinarian should be able
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
to forward records even to maybe a a
 
03:34:51.030 --> 03:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
specialist and then the specialist can
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
review that and say they concur as
 
03:34:55.870 --> 03:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to maybe even having to see The
 
03:34:58.030 --> 03:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
Specialist representative Freeman and
 
03:34:59.389 --> 03:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:35:04.349 --> 03:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Dr Boya sure how
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
difficult was it for you to find a
 
03:35:09.389 --> 03:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
specialist uh took a phone call there we
 
03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
have plenty of board certified Internal
 
03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
Medicine Specialists in the state of New
 
03:35:14.189 --> 03:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and this this there's
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
another question with this as well as
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
statement you're a vet so you would know
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
right off the top of your head who would
 
03:35:22.269 --> 03:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
specialize in this you're that is
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
correct ma'am I would say however if I
 
03:35:26.070 --> 03:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
had a patient if you if you came to me
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
as a general practice veterinarian and
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
you and you brought me your dog and said
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
I can't vaccinate my dog for abies
 
03:35:32.670 --> 03:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
here's the reasons why if I felt that
 
03:35:35.550 --> 03:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
was legitimate I would put you to that
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
specialist and say this is who you need
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
to go see here's the paperwork they need
 
03:35:41.710 --> 03:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
to sign i' send all the records as to
 
03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
why you shouldn't have the vaccine and
 
03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
then send have that specialist sign it I
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
mean I would coordinate that for my my
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
owner thank you and and just just out of
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
curiosity um what is the average cost to
 
03:35:56.790 --> 03:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
taking your dog to a vet a specialist to
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
get a letter of
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
exemption I would say probably on the
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
$200 representative Bixby representative
 
03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh come her question was answered so uh
 
03:36:13.229 --> 03:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know if there is a list
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
of board certified uh Specialists on the
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture's
 
03:36:20.590 --> 03:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
website I don't believe that there is
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
Sir and I think that's an excellent idea
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
although it would have to be kept
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
updated um you it's not difficult to
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
locate one on you can type in board
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
certified Internal Medicine veterinarian
 
03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you can there's a link
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
to a list I mean their their
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
organization has lists but I don't think
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's a bad idea okay thank you okay
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
sure um any other questions thank you so
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
much for coming and testifying thank you
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh Stacy o from the American Kennel Club
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
requested thank you chair Aaron members
 
03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee Stacy Ober uh
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
government relations in New England for
 
03:37:01.349 --> 03:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
the American Kennel Club and uh just
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to register akc's opposition to
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 240 I don't think we could
 
03:37:14.349 --> 03:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
over uh overestimate the significance of
 
03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
rabies as a fatal threat and uh the risk
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
even has resulted for instance um back
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
in 20121 the United States Center for
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
Disease Control banned importing dogs
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
from more than 100 countries that are
 
03:37:36.510 --> 03:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
not uh like the United States rabies uh
 
03:37:39.710 --> 03:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
you know canine rabies um exempt and so
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
they've even moved forward in trying to
 
03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
implement some additional rules because
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
we did have dogs that were imported into
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
the United States with rabes as a result
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
of fraudulent Health certificates so I
 
03:37:53.469 --> 03:37:53.479 align:start position:0%
just raised that as as one issue
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
completely respect that this individual
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
has gone through the process of looking
 
03:38:02.910 --> 03:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
to get the exemption and as I look at um
 
03:38:05.710 --> 03:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
46614 I think it could be helpful to
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
refer to the exemption section because
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's not clearly stated that there is a
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
process there but secondly I would
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
discourage the committee from
 
03:38:17.269 --> 03:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
eliminating the forfeiture piece and
 
03:38:20.110 --> 03:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's even as a follow on to Dr Boer
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
noting that some people may just refuse
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
um to get the rabies vaccine they may
 
03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
not be a candidate for the exemption and
 
03:38:30.269 --> 03:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
because this is such a serious public
 
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
health issue there is no cure for rabies
 
03:38:34.670 --> 03:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
it may be in the best interest of the
 
03:38:36.670 --> 03:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
community to have that dog seized or to
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
have a big a big stick so to say in
 
03:38:42.429 --> 03:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
terms of uh forcing that an animal get
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh vaccinated for rabies thank you any
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%

cats and here to introduce the
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%

need me to introduce it I will yeah by
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
the way um I had our committee
 
03:40:33.870 --> 03:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
researcher uh prepare report um
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
regarding past legislation and research
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
about banning the declo of cats um
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
because this committee has heard this
 
03:40:43.870 --> 03:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
bill four times or three times before
 
03:40:45.510 --> 03:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
and I just thought the committee might
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
be interested in what happened to uh
 
03:40:51.550 --> 03:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
pass legislation so half of you go one
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%

representative

03:41:07.070 --> 03:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.510 --> 03:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
bordes good afternoon representative
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
bordes and you are here to uh introduce
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
your bill uh hb21 prohibiting the
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
cats

03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:30.750 --> 03:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
y Oh I thought it was on nope guess not
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
now it's on um it's very similar to
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 231 that passed the house in
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
2023 what this is is an act prohibiting
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
the removal of Claws from cats um as
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
many of you already know removing Claws
 
03:41:47.950 --> 03:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
from cats is equivalent to cutting your
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
finger off at the middle knuckle It's
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually an
 
03:41:54.389 --> 03:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
amputation it's uh not a surgery it's an
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
actual amputation that could be painful
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
to the animal um a lot of individuals
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
will get their cats declawed because the
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
cat's scratching the
 
03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
furniture um to me that's unacceptable
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
It's a cruel
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
inhumane procedure many veterinarians
 
03:42:14.910 --> 03:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
agree um I know we discussed before
 
03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
actually a lot of corporate
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarians would not even perform the
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
procedure um and I I don't think it's
 
03:42:24.429 --> 03:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
Humane to just because you can't might
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
scratch their Furniture to have them
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
their claw removed from them and perform
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
an amputation we wouldn't do that to a
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
child if he drew on the wall with
 
03:42:35.469 --> 03:42:35.479 align:start position:0%
crayons so why are we going to do that
 
03:42:39.070 --> 03:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
to an animal uh it's just cruel and
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
inhumane uh there are some exceptions
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
for medical reasons if say the cat has
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
cancer and that claw needs to be
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
amputated in situations like that there
 
03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
are exemptions to this but overall this
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
is just the basic prohibit of removal of
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
Claws from the
 
03:43:01.349 --> 03:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
cat any questions representative ger
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative good to see you uh so uh
 
03:43:07.469 --> 03:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
I my first question is a technical
 
03:43:10.149 --> 03:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
question about the bill uh the the bill
 
03:43:12.189 --> 03:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
itself the language makes clear in
 
03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
section two starting in line 10 uh that
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
the this is a civil
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
penalty uh the analysis on the first
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
page says the bill creates a criminal
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
penalty for declawing a cat could you
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
clarify this is not a criminal penalty
 
03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
correct it is in fact penalty correct
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and may I have a followup
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
mam chair followup sure uh thank you uh
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative have you heard from vets
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
as I have that this is something that
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
they would like to see in place so that
 
03:43:43.710 --> 03:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes and asks them to
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
perform this procedure they can simply
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
say no it is not legal in the state of
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I 100% I've heard that
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
from numerous veterinarians including my
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
own um you know a lot of the a lot of
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
practices will not perform it um but
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
there are still veterinarian practices
 
03:44:01.389 --> 03:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
that allow it and some veterinarians do
 
03:44:03.870 --> 03:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
not want to perform the procedure thank
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
you representative ktoa thank you madam
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
question um I know that we've heard this
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
bill before but I will I am really want
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
to know the statis itics on how many de
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
cat decls are being performed in the
 
03:44:20.149 --> 03:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
State per year so we we've discussed
 
03:44:22.590 --> 03:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
this numerous times nobody has been able
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
to pull those actual numbers down you
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
can't get them from anywhere um I mean
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's been some research done I don't
 
03:44:31.950 --> 03:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
I don't want to misspeak so I don't want
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
to come up with numbers but the
 
03:44:36.510 --> 03:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
procedure is still being done in New
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow representative H
 
03:44:41.229 --> 03:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair and and
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bordis one
 
03:44:47.309 --> 03:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
animal rights activist to another um
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
would you be open to an amendment that
 
03:44:55.229 --> 03:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
said if someone had a um condition
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
physically that a cat with claws whom
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
they love could inflict harm on them
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
because of their medical disability
 
03:45:09.309 --> 03:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
would you be open to such an amendment I
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
would have to see the I I would be open
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
to it cons I would have to speak to some
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and doctors about that um
 
03:45:18.389 --> 03:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
cuz I do know another side condition of
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
the C and dcla now instead of scratching
 
03:45:23.830 --> 03:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
they bite and a bite is actually more
 
03:45:26.189 --> 03:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
harmful to a human than a scratches
 
03:45:28.110 --> 03:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
indeed thank
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none oh representative
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
Freeman oh yeah okay oh thank you madam
 
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative borders
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us um I do have a
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
question would you be open to an
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that would take out the Civil
 
03:45:46.510 --> 03:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
Penal penalties pot and just make it
 
03:45:47.950 --> 03:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
illegal to do
 
03:45:51.070 --> 03:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
this I mean if there's no way to enforce
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
it I don't understand why that we would
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
even I mean if we make it illegal what
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
with no penalty what good would it be
 
03:46:00.870 --> 03:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
what do I have a followup followup well
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
I just heard someone say that some vets
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
need an excuse to say no correct so this
 
03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
would give them the excuse to say no
 
03:46:13.149 --> 03:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
accurate if there's no well I guess I
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
could give them the excuse to say no I
 
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
just don't know what enforcement
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism you would have for people
 
03:46:22.359 --> 03:46:24.110 align:start position:0%
mechanism you would have for people
violating

03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
violating
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
it well we can we can discuss that
 
03:46:28.110 --> 03:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
further I just wanted to know if you
 
03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
would be open to a friendly Amendment
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
I'm open to anything but I just want to
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
make sure what we're doing is proper and
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
there is some sort of enforcement
 
03:46:38.830 --> 03:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism representative Scully thank
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for being here
 
03:46:42.830 --> 03:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
to answer give testimony to answer
 
03:46:45.309 --> 03:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
questions um when it says no person
 
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
shall remove the claws does that refer
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
to the owner does it refer to the vet
 
03:46:52.990 --> 03:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
who is the agent performing the actions
 
03:46:55.710 --> 03:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
for the owner is it both it would be
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the veterinarian that was
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
performing the procedure if somebody
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
decided to decl their cat at home I
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
definitely think they should be charged
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
as well well it's a civil penalty but I
 
03:47:06.120 --> 03:47:06.990 align:start position:0%
as well well it's a civil penalty but I
mean

03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah that'd be pretty gruesome may
 
03:47:13.630 --> 03:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
ask followup follow up thank you um my
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
concern is um
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
what would happen if a person who
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
adopted a declaw cat and then took it
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
into a vet for service would they
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
potentially be liable if somebody
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
dropped a dime on them and said they've
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
got a declaw cat I I couldn't see that
 
03:47:32.149 --> 03:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
being an issue I mean the the declin has
 
03:47:34.030 --> 03:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
been taken place previously I don't know
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
if we could do an amendment to clarify
 
03:47:38.590 --> 03:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
that but I mean I don't see any issue
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know if the GU was already
 
03:47:41.469 --> 03:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
previously declo or say he came from
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
another state decored there should be
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
some sort of record as far as
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that performed it or where
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
it was done to show that it was done
 
03:47:52.750 --> 03:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.790 --> 03:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
enacted okay you had a
 
03:47:58.269 --> 03:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
question okay representative Bixby and
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
then representative Miner just a
 
03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying question so uh the bill uh
 
03:48:05.950 --> 03:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
the bill bans the de the act of
 
03:48:08.110 --> 03:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
declawing cats not the possession of
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
declawed cats correct 100% thank you yes
 
03:48:14.830 --> 03:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Miner thank you thank you
 
03:48:16.990 --> 03:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
you uh representative boards now I've
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
spoken with a couple of veterinarians uh
 
03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
from our community and um they say that
 
03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
this procedure isn't uh isn't um huge in
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
nature do you have any idea how many
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
people how many cats are being declawed
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to get numbers for
 
03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
forever there is no actual statistic to
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
show that I
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
think there's I know it's still being
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
performed in this state veteran Arians
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
admit it's still being performed but
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
there's no actual numbers to show
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you so one of
 
03:48:51.670 --> 03:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians that I spoke with has
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
told me that she's she's been a
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
practicing vet for 40 years and she's
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
done performed this twice so I don't
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
think it's widespread do you I think
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's happening a lot more than people
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
know thank you
 
03:49:08.269 --> 03:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
Penza so I have two questions my first
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
question is since this bill um has uh
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
been introduced I think this would be
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
the fourth time and but I was here last
 
03:49:16.990 --> 03:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
term and I went through all the
 
03:49:18.670 --> 03:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and and and by the way on the
 
03:49:20.670 --> 03:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
record I think it's absolutely the most
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
barbaric procedure if it's happening um
 
03:49:25.870 --> 03:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
like you said just like a human at the
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
knuckle so um if we don't have the data
 
03:49:32.309 --> 03:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
and everyone that I've talked to says
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's not happening and most vets even
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
refuse to do it um in Rochester anywhere
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
where I represent um why not put a bill
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
in to actually find out what those in
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
that information is like in requiring
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
vets to to do that why not amend the
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
bill so we have the data and if it's not
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
a problem then it's unnecessary
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that's needed so we've tried
 
03:49:58.269 --> 03:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
to obtain data that there is no data
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
source to get that information from um I
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't think they're keeping accurate
 
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
records of it I I don't know why there
 
03:50:06.830 --> 03:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
is no data but it's it's very hard to
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
find there's been some if you check
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
phone kind of surveys done with some
 
03:50:15.309 --> 03:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in the area where somebody
 
03:50:16.750 --> 03:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
would call up and say hey I'm interested
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
in having my cath declo is this a
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
procedure you with do and the
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
veterinarian will say yes that data I
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
don't have but there was a breakdown of
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
that um but it's definitely still
 
03:50:29.110 --> 03:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
occurring in the state follow up but
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's my point instead
 
03:50:33.389 --> 03:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
of we you know doing the same thing over
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
and over and expecting different results
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
so after the second time that it failed
 
03:50:39.309 --> 03:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
why wasn't a legislation put in to
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
require vets to to put this reporting
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
criteria in so at least we would have
 
03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
the the data I mean if we don't have the
 
03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
data then we're obviously we shouldn't
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
be passing legislation based upon what
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
ifs it's not really what ifs because it
 
03:50:56.110 --> 03:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
is occurring we just don't have numbers
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
occurring representative Bixby Madam
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
chair would it be appropriate for me to
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
um read some of the information from the
 
03:51:08.309 --> 03:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee researcher that you uh
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
requested in terms of what's known about
 
03:51:11.120 --> 03:51:12.070 align:start position:0%
requested in terms of what's known about
uh

03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
frequency um sure absolutely okay
 
03:51:20.670 --> 03:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
so um there's no Central data collection
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it is uh there's no
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
requirement for reporting uh in 2020 the
 
03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh Veterinary uh Medical
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
Association conducted a survey with
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
clinics in their database inquiring if
 
03:51:38.670 --> 03:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
they allow
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
Decline and the survey results show that
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
86 out of 146 responses offered services
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
including declaw removal tail docking
 
03:51:52.269 --> 03:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
ear cropping Etc so that's uh 80 more
 
03:51:56.110 --> 03:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
than half of the uh veterinary clinics
 
03:51:59.070 --> 03:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
surveyed in 2020 did offer this as a
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
service um and according to a uh January
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
2025 article uh a New Hampshire
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
veterinarian pulled data on declining
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
from her own practice before she bought
 
03:52:12.790 --> 03:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
it in 2018 and banned the operation
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
there she found that at least 16 decla
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
procedures had been uh done there uh the
 
03:52:23.189 --> 03:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
year before the practice was sold so uh
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't give a clear sense of
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
prevalence but it does suggest that
 
03:52:31.229 --> 03:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
there is in that it is in in fact still
 
03:52:34.590 --> 03:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
happening is there a question there uh
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
no I I asked you if I could read that
 
03:52:39.309 --> 03:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
information from from the from the data
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
I I thought you were going to read
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
something and then ask a question okay
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
so uh I just thought that that would be
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of instead of just sort of
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
asking questions about why don't we have
 
03:52:50.670 --> 03:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
any data at least get the data that we
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you um I I wanted just
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
to say you know I've got several pin
 
03:53:00.269 --> 03:53:00.279 align:start position:0%
cards here if you are signed up to speak
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
and you have already heard somebody say
 
03:53:04.469 --> 03:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
something that you're going to say
 
03:53:07.389 --> 03:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
please wave off U speaking because time
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
is of the essence and I guess
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative King you had a question
 
03:53:14.269 --> 03:53:14.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh my apologies if
 
03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
this has already been answered but um um
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
do you believe that your bill either
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
would or should hold somebody civil
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
liable if they take their cat out of
 
03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
state to get the procedure
 
03:53:29.830 --> 03:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
done that's a I think I think they
 
03:53:31.710 --> 03:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
should be held silverly liable because
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
it it's would be against New Hampshire
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
state law I don't know how you would
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
enforce that to be honest with you or
 
03:53:38.910 --> 03:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
what sort of enforcement mechanism you
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
would I mean how do you prove where the
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
cat was declo but I mean mean I know our
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
nebit in the South which I know we're
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
different then but they just passed the
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
same exact law in Massachusetts so they
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's starting to become more and more
 
03:53:57.189 --> 03:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
common a lot of municipalities and are
 
03:53:59.790 --> 03:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
enacting similar laws thank
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
03:54:06.189 --> 03:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
Penza so I was educated over lunch which
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
um I have a I I love cats I had cats
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
can't have cats now my husband's
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
allergic so I was educated over lunch of
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
the new version of cat uh declaw that
 
03:54:18.630 --> 03:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
has been in place in practice for a long
 
03:54:20.510 --> 03:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
time versus the one that I'm familiar
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
with from 40 years ago which is the
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
horrific practice so what if the numbers
 
03:54:29.670 --> 03:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
that he just gave are where it is not
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
touching at the knuckle they're actually
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
it's just doing at the claw and there's
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
like this special glue if that is the
 
03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
case and what they're using now with all
 
03:54:41.070 --> 03:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
of the technology that we have which we
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have 40 years ago then you bill
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
becomes null and void because it's not
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
doing that type of what we're talking
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
about which is really abuse it's I mean
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's still being done that way as far as
 
03:54:58.149 --> 03:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
I know um I mean the ma majority of
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarians will have said that's the
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
way it's been done um I mean they make
 
03:55:04.349 --> 03:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
claw protectors now that you can put
 
03:55:05.790 --> 03:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
over your cat's claws if you're worried
 
03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
about the cat scratching Furniture but
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
amputating at the digits is just
 
03:55:11.520 --> 03:55:13.309 align:start position:0%
amputating at the digits is just
humanely

03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
humanely
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
insane representative
 
03:55:19.149 --> 03:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
wheeler would you believe that the clat
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
decl the clat decline the cat decline p
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh procedure that representative patens
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
described still does when you put the
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
glue in create a problem for the cat and
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
its ability to walk after the
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
procedure's been done for many months
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
afterwards because the cat's claws are
 
03:55:41.550 --> 03:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
similar to how our little toe if we lost
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
a little toe we might be off balance a
 
03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
little bit the cat Clause is a big part
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
to it to its balance so even taking the
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
cloud and the and the way they do the
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
procedure now is is still damaging to
 
03:55:54.149 --> 03:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
the cats actually yes you are correct in
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
that statement also when it comes time
 
03:55:58.389 --> 03:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
to go use the litter box and such
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes they stop using their lit box
 
03:56:01.870 --> 03:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
they off balance they don't have as much
 
03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
control the other aspect which I didn't
 
03:56:06.269 --> 03:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
bring up is you have an indoor cat you
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
get it declo he escapes gets outside
 
03:56:11.110 --> 03:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's no defense mechanism for that
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
animal they can't climb up a tree they
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
can't protect themselves they're
 
03:56:16.269 --> 03:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
basically just sitting there as prey at
 
03:56:16.279 --> 03:56:17.269 align:start position:0%
basically just sitting there as prey at
that

03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
point represent
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
Bixby so um a new This Modern procedure
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned and I'm wondering if
 
03:56:27.870 --> 03:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the ones that is listed in
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
the bill so the bill lists uh onomy
 
03:56:35.469 --> 03:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
partial or complete fing
 
03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
fomy tend tendonectomy uh is that is
 
03:56:42.429 --> 03:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
that procedure that representative Penza
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
and Wheeler mentioned one of those or I
 
03:56:47.189 --> 03:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
would have to check back to actually
 
03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
look at the medical terms um I'm not
 
03:56:53.149 --> 03:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
positive to be honest with you thank you
 
03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:56:57.309 --> 03:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:56:57.319 --> 03:56:58.910 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
hi again you need to put your microphone
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
on thank you is that on now sorry than
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
all right hi so I'm still Dr Lisa Boer
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm still a New Hampshire
 
03:57:29.950 --> 03:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarian with 23 years of experience
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm also a court- qualified expert
 
03:57:33.309 --> 03:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
in multiple jurisdictions in Animal
 
03:57:35.710 --> 03:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
Welfare cruelty and abuse and I strongly
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill for several reasons it
 
03:57:41.149 --> 03:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
number one um it removes my autonomy as
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian to make a medical
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
decision about a patient it also removes
 
03:57:47.950 --> 03:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for me to educate clients
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
if an owner comes to me and asks about
 
03:57:52.030 --> 03:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
declawing their cat we engage in a
 
03:57:53.790 --> 03:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussion including what
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
prompted them to want the procedure and
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
more importantly we'll explore the
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
problem and alternative Solutions I
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
personally do not perform declaw and
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't need the legislature to
 
03:58:08.710 --> 03:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
tell me I need an excuse to say no if I
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
choose not to do that I'm capable of
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
telling my client no I don't do
 
03:58:15.309 --> 03:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
convenience euthanasia either there you
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that this would have no impact for for
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
me I'll say no regardless of the law the
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
um sometimes those these discussions
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
will lead to a medical diagnosis and
 
03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
treatment of a problem where the owner
 
03:58:29.070 --> 03:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
thought the declaw was the solution but
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
it really was something else and that's
 
03:58:33.790 --> 03:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
important to me the legislation
 
03:58:35.710 --> 03:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
diminishes the collaboration between a
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
loving pet owner and a trusted
 
03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian the public understands that
 
03:58:41.309 --> 03:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarians do not wish to do harm to
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
their patients we take an oath to
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
protect the health and welfare this law
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
undermines my professional judgment and
 
03:58:49.389 --> 03:58:49.399 align:start position:0%
is an unnecessary law that frankly will
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
have no effect on the Health and Welfare
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
of cats in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
another issue is if legislators should
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
substitute their judgment about medical
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
procedures where you they do not have
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
the scientific knowledge to make that
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
decision this would be the first time
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire lawmakers would
 
03:59:06.630 --> 03:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
publicly be questioning a profession's
 
03:59:08.750 --> 03:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
Integrity by agreeing with Bill
 
03:59:10.349 --> 03:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
proponents that New Hampshire licensed
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are engaging in animal
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
cruelty activity that needs the state to
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
intervene and stop this is not true and
 
03:59:20.110 --> 03:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
it's an unacceptable slippery slope our
 
03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge science and medicine evolve
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
over time procedures we did 20 years ago
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
have improved and if we ban a procedure
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
now and our knowledge changes later are
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
we going to go back and Rel legislate
 
03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
this I don't think so how is this bill
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to be enforced is there going to
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
be an inspection of hospitals records
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
who's going to enforce it and frankly is
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
a civil fine really going to change
 
03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
anything some people feel decline cats
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
is animal cruelty and in reality when
 
03:59:49.149 --> 03:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
performed by a veterinarian with proper
 
03:59:51.389 --> 03:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
technique anesthesia post-operative care
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
including pain management it isn't
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty however we still can
 
03:59:59.469 --> 03:59:59.479 align:start position:0%
choose not to do it in 2020 the avma
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
revised their decline policy and
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
discourages the decline of domestic cats
 
04:00:06.630 --> 04:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
as an elective procedure the association
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
however encourages the use of
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
Alternatives but says professional
 
04:00:13.389 --> 04:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
judgment is key when making a decision
 
04:00:15.710 --> 04:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
as to whether a dclock hat why do
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
lawmakers feel they have more
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
professional judgment than a highly
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
trained and properly licensed Medical
 
04:00:24.149 --> 04:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
Professional my final point will address
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby that is this
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
really a problem at all in the state of
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when you read that
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
statistic from the study of the nhvma
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
that 86 out of 100 offered those
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
Services I bet if you took that
 
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
statement and only asked about declaw
 
04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
you would find almost none I cannot
 
04:00:44.429 --> 04:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
recall the last time I have seen a
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
declawed cat in practice even not even
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
that coming to me for a declaw just a
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
declawed cat period it is I don't we
 
04:00:53.710 --> 04:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
every colleague I know does not do these
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
procedures this is a law in search of a
 
04:00:58.469 --> 04:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
problem and I urge you not to infringe
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
upon my rights as a veterinarian to make
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
an ethical informed and appropriate
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
medical decision for my patients and
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
clients and I'm happy to entertain
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and can we have copy
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
of your testy to representative German
 
04:01:13.269 --> 04:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you Dr
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
Boer for taking my my question so the
 
04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
the bill uh States clearly clearly on
 
04:01:21.870 --> 04:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
line five lines five and six that uh
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
there are exemptions for a physical uh
 
04:01:27.070 --> 04:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
and medical condition of the cat in
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
other words for uh conditions that a
 
04:01:31.149 --> 04:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
veterinarian would deem for for the
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
health of the cat so could you explain
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
to me looking at the language of the
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill how this takes away the ability of
 
04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian to make that
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
determination and what in the language
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill interferes with a
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to talk to
 
04:01:46.269 --> 04:01:46.279 align:start position:0%
someone who comes into their practice to
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
ask for the procedure you're you're
 
04:01:49.389 --> 04:01:49.399 align:start position:0%
preventing the person from coming
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
through the door in the first place if
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
they call and say do you declo cats we
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
say no they go somewhere else we can't
 
04:01:57.389 --> 04:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
even start the discussion they won't
 
04:01:59.110 --> 04:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
ever get to their veterinarian to have
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
that discussion and so and you know and
 
04:02:06.149 --> 04:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is for me um much like um any other
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
procedure I'm you know we have every
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian has their moral and ethical
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
line but we're all really sworn to help
 
04:02:15.550 --> 04:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
promote the health welfare of animals we
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
all have continuing education
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
requirements we all are well aware of
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
Pros cons you know of any kind of
 
04:02:25.149 --> 04:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
medical procedure that we do and I I
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
really would challenge those numbers
 
04:02:29.550 --> 04:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
from the nhvma I I don't think that it
 
04:02:31.309 --> 04:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
is even really being done I don't know
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
anybody who in the state that does this
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
procedure and if they do the procedure
 
04:02:38.790 --> 04:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not by clipping off the ends
 
04:02:41.070 --> 04:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
of you know the the joints I mean
 
04:02:44.189 --> 04:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's other ways to do it I I
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't feel that that bill necess it see
 
04:02:52.030 --> 04:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
how I put this the bill may not tell me
 
04:02:54.030 --> 04:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
I can't make a medical decision for my
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
patient but my what the bill is doing is
 
04:03:00.510 --> 04:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
saying that we need the legislature to
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
dictate how we practice medicine and
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's the problem we get into because
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
this will be the first of many other
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
things that could come down that road
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
now the next thing if we ban this what
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
else are we going to ban are we going to
 
04:03:14.830 --> 04:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
go through every list of procedures that
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian can perform and now
 
04:03:18.910 --> 04:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
decide which ones we can and can't do I
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
think that's wrong I really do I think
 
04:03:22.750 --> 04:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's wrong for people and I think it's
 
04:03:24.990 --> 04:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
wrong for Animals I have followup Madam
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
chair followup yeah thank you very much
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that uh can you give us
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
some guidance and some advice on how to
 
04:03:34.590 --> 04:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
think about this when we have a
 
04:03:37.229 --> 04:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarian testifying as you have and
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
we could have an equal number of
 
04:03:40.750 --> 04:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians on the other side of the
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
issue so we have somebody making a very
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
compelling argument you have but we also
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
have like my personal Veterinary and
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
making a very compelling argument on the
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
other side so U how do you think we
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
should approach this issue when we have
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
very uh expert uh Witnesses giving us uh
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh advice that's in kind of 180 degree
 
04:04:03.309 --> 04:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
opposite directions I think that's a
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
great question I think first of all I
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
will not sit here and tell you that
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
doing decline cats is okay all right I'm
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
not going to tell you that that's true
 
04:04:14.910 --> 04:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
cuz I don't I personally don't do the
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
procedure because I don't like to do the
 
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
procedure I'm not I and I don't just
 
04:04:21.149 --> 04:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for it I have other
 
04:04:23.229 --> 04:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
Alternatives at my disposal other than
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
decline cats however there may be that
 
04:04:28.990 --> 04:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
one time that I have a patient where
 
04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
maybe that is the only alternative to
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
prevent a euthanasia or and if it can be
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
done in a Humane or safe manner I'd like
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to have an option anyway and
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's I mean in my entire career I have
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
done exactly one declaw they don't even
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
train it in Veterinary school anymore I
 
04:04:47.229 --> 04:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
mean it's not something you're taught so
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's something You' have to learn how to
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
do and I just I think the it goes beyond
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
just decline I if why do we need a bill
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
for something that really isn't occur in
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
my experience occurring the state any
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian should be able to tell
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
their client no I'm sorry I'm not going
 
04:05:05.630 --> 04:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
to do that we have that right we don't
 
04:05:07.389 --> 04:05:07.399 align:start position:0%
we're not at the you know at the behest
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
of our client to do medical procedures
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
we aren't okay with just as I wouldn't
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
do a surgery I wasn't comfortable with I
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do vaccine I wasn't comfortable
 
04:05:16.030 --> 04:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't do a medical treatment I
 
04:05:18.149 --> 04:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't comfortable with that's that's on
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
me as a professional I don't think the
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to mandate that thank
 
04:05:25.389 --> 04:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
you very much represent
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:05:29.429 --> 04:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um very
 
04:05:29.439 --> 04:05:30.670 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um very
compelling

04:05:30.670 --> 04:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
compelling
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
testimony do you have any idea when like
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
the date of um when they stopped
 
04:05:36.560 --> 04:05:39.309 align:start position:0%
the date of um when they stopped
teaching

04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.189 --> 04:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
it well I a 2002 graduate it wasn't I we
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
although they weren't teaching it in
 
04:05:50.429 --> 04:05:50.439 align:start position:0%
school it was still performed I don't
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
believe I I know that we don't te it
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't been taught as a regular
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
procedure they're too busy just teaching
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
basic spays and neuters you know I mean
 
04:06:00.389 --> 04:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
they really don't teach a lot of those
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
other kinds of procedures in school but
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
if we do get education as to what the
 
04:06:06.990 --> 04:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
procedures are maybe not how to
 
04:06:08.429 --> 04:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
physically perform them what the nature
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
of those procedures are there is
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
education about the pros and the cons of
 
04:06:13.950 --> 04:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
those procedures you know what actually
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
happens when the procedures are done
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
what are the consequences of that
 
04:06:18.990 --> 04:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
procedure so I think veterinarians are
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
well educated as to the positive or
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes of that type of
 
04:06:24.910 --> 04:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
procedure and I think it still relies on
 
04:06:27.309 --> 04:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
their professional judgment in in a
 
04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
total but I I I think I would ask the
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee if you really want the numbers
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
to know who is performing those these
 
04:06:36.510 --> 04:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
procedures if I mean that's what you
 
04:06:39.309 --> 04:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
need to get down to right so why not
 
04:06:40.510 --> 04:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
study that says and I don't think has to
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
be legislated study but why not have
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
some research where the veterinarians in
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are surveyed
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
and just leave it as decline
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
only okay don't lump it in with tail
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
ducks ear crops and everything else
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
because if you called a clinic and said
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
do you do these four procedures well
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't do one of them but
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
there's no way 86 out of 100 clinics do
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
declaw I guarantee that thank you very
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you any other questions
 
04:07:12.630 --> 04:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
represent Barber yes thank you Dr Bo for
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
I have a a question about informed
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
consent have you had patients uh I'm
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
sorry cat owners come in to ask you
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
about the declawing had the opportunity
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
to discuss the procedure the
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
outcome um the
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
details and if that's the case how many
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
of them then go forward go continue to
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
ask you can we then go forward with this
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's a phenomenal question actually I
 
04:07:44.590 --> 04:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
think when properly educated owners
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
would virtually never elect this
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
procedure okay can I ask another
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
04:07:53.950 --> 04:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
followup thank you yes my other question
 
04:07:57.070 --> 04:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
is about um uh the recording of
 
04:07:57.080 --> 04:07:59.070 align:start position:0%
is about um uh the recording of
information

04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:08:04.109 --> 04:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
statistics are you required to um tell
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
the state when you provide a rabies
 
04:08:10.030 --> 04:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine or any other vaccine or other
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
health issues having to deal with the
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
animals in your practice do you have to
 
04:08:17.710 --> 04:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
report anything to the state
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
no and and frankly I I think that that
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
opens up a whole can of worms you know
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
if we have to report every single
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
disease or every single procedure we do
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
that gets very difficult and it may even
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
infringe upon owner confidentiality I we
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
don't have Hippa but we have
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality one last question yes
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
related to that
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
um if we were to ask ask in the search
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that we're talking about
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
is that something that you think
 
04:08:52.670 --> 04:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
veterinarian practices would be willing
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
to do on an anonymous basis to give the
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
reporting of how many of these
 
04:09:00.990 --> 04:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
procedures they
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
do I think if it were a properly framed
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
survey that was truly Anonymous yeah I
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
do think most people would answer that I
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
do I don't see why they
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't any other questions from the
 
04:09:12.359 --> 04:09:13.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't any other questions from the
committee

04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%

time from all of you how much you love
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
animals I'm walking around here oh I
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
love animals I have two cats I how many
 
04:10:25.830 --> 04:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
cats do you have who has a declawed
 
04:10:25.840 --> 04:10:28.469 align:start position:0%
cats do you have who has a declawed
cat

04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
cat
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
anyone yeah so we all love animals this
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
bill is cruel and this bill is about
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
ending cruelty to
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
cats and when we hear from veterinarians
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
all they can tell us is don't tell us
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
what to do we don't do I don't you can't
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
find a veterinarian in this state who
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
will tell you that they do it but you
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
call them up and they'll offer the
 
04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
service and uh that statistic is
 
04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
undeniable it's the only one we have
 
04:11:03.870 --> 04:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
actually right now is
 
04:11:06.670 --> 04:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
86% offer
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
it 16 cats we know from that paper from
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
were declawed how many years ago four
 
04:11:17.520 --> 04:11:21.070 align:start position:0%
were declawed how many years ago four
three

04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.950 --> 04:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
two yeah so recently recently enough so
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
that question let's put that to bed it
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
happens it's cruel it's
 
04:11:30.840 --> 04:11:32.790 align:start position:0%
happens it's cruel it's
unusual

04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
period so I just go through a few things
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:11:40.269 --> 04:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
procedure there's no valid reason for it
 
04:11:41.790 --> 04:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
by the
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
way in the the bill there is an
 
04:11:47.309 --> 04:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
exemption for veterinarians to do the
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
procedure if they think it's
 
04:11:49.199 --> 04:11:53.790 align:start position:0%
procedure if they think it's
necessary

04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
period okay you can you can easily trim
 
04:11:58.590 --> 04:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
the nails of a cat to keep it from
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
scratching you or to keep it from
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
damaging your
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
furniture the CDC the Center for Disease
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
Control says it's not
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
advised to to decla hats for Hume any
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of human health
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue the national hemophilia
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
association does not recommend
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
Decline and scratching for cats is
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
natural and
 
04:12:28.109 --> 04:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
necessary remember what we're talking
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
about not withstanding any fiction about
 
04:12:33.550 --> 04:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
new procedures what's in the bill is the
 
04:12:36.510 --> 04:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
cutting off what's in the bill is the
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
cutting off of the tips of the cat's
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
fingers toes whatever you want to call
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
them that part of the Paw irreparable it
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
changes the way they live they can no
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
longer defend themselves with their paws
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
or their claws so they bite
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
people or whatever that threat may
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.469 --> 04:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
brief so much
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
misinformation to
 
04:13:10.990 --> 04:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay the tip of the Paw bass
 
04:13:13.149 --> 04:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
basically has glands that are necessary
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
for the cat to exist scent glands things
 
04:13:16.439 --> 04:13:17.870 align:start position:0%
for the cat to exist scent glands things
like

04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
that I want to reiterate veterinarians
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
retain the ability to do whatever they
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
need for the health of their patient
 
04:13:29.550 --> 04:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
it's they can't do it for cosmetic
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
reasons or the convenience of an owner
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
scratched um it's being come becoming
 
04:13:42.429 --> 04:13:42.439 align:start position:0%
more widespread in Europe it's almost
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:55.590 --> 04:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just once again the
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
objection that it's not being done in
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
the state we've dealt with that 86% of
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
vets offer it it's it was done 16 times
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
in 1917 or whatever 2017 I'm getting old
 
04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
um for medical autonomy the veterinarian
 
04:14:15.189 --> 04:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
has Medical autonomy to do the procedure
 
04:14:18.189 --> 04:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
if they think it's medically
 
04:14:21.710 --> 04:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
necessary and if we have 86% who offer
 
04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
it but we can't find a
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
vet to admit that they do it they must
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
be ashamed of doing it and even the
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
person who who spoke before me oh I
 
04:14:34.269 --> 04:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
would never do
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
it I would never do it but I need to be
 
04:14:37.439 --> 04:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
it I would never do it but I need to be
able

04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.109 --> 04:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
to and the uh the question of human
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
Health we've dealt with um I I sent I
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
think I sent everyone a fact sheet and
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
some letters from some people uh not all
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
of you but most of you
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
um and that that that would be my
 
04:14:59.950 --> 04:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
testimony again I would just say to to
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
to surise if you've ever had a cat loved
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
a cat known someone who's loved a cat
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
love someone who loves a cat you got to
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative Barber thank
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
you so much for your testimony you
 
04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned that 80% 86% of veterinarians
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire offer
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
decline I'll uh def defer to
 
04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative big it was the survey
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
said 86 out of 146 so that's not
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
86% it's lower sorry I got that wrong
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
I'm really bad at math
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:15:47.950 --> 04:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
followup follow up on that if we're
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
using that number um is that anecdotal
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
is that selfreported is that simply by
 
04:16:01.149 --> 04:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
phone calls or is that an actual um
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
number that was gotten by written survey
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
me if you so in this I'll hand out that
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
we got from Judy from representative
 
04:16:18.429 --> 04:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
Aaron uh the numbers are in there
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay that a question was that a question
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to address it no she
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted some clarification and and
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
i' Madam chair I'd like to clarify a
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
little bit further the the uh numbers
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
for representative Barbara that those
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
statistics didn't wasn't just about it
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
asked about several procedures not just
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
declaw so if they performed any one of
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
those procedures mentioned they're
 
04:16:49.149 --> 04:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
included they may not even include a
 
04:16:51.070 --> 04:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian clinic may not even do a
 
04:16:53.109 --> 04:16:53.119 align:start position:0%
declaw but they would be included in
 
04:16:53.119 --> 04:16:54.109 align:start position:0%
declaw but they would be included in
that

04:16:54.109 --> 04:16:54.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
number one is too many one
 
04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
kitten who has subjected to this
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
procedure unnecessarily in this state
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
because you refuse to address this is
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
one too many repres um Mr arenburg that
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%

04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
occasionally arise for various reasons
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
however most of these complications can
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
be effectively address through
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
interventions we recently pulled our
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
members as to whether they offer declare
 
04:19:31.229 --> 04:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
declaw routinely and the vast majority
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
replied that they do
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
not 83% do not offer it at all the
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
remaining only offer it as a last
 
04:19:42.790 --> 04:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
resort this fact shows overwhelmingly
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
that our membership is not pro declaw
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
and tying this data from previous
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
surveys we have done the majority of our
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
membership resents government oversight
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
into the procedures in our
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
profession enacting this bill would
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
simply be virtue signaling allow my
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
members to retain their autonomy in
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
decisions that affle their clients and
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
patients and with all due respect the
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
survey that we did back in 2020 was a
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
combined survey for the two bills that
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
were brought up in front of the
 
04:20:16.510 --> 04:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislature so to put that data together
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
um is not an appropriate use of that
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
data in my
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
opinion um I will take any questions
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
that you have for me today thank you
 
04:20:28.349 --> 04:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative German thank you madam
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
chair uh and thank you for taking my
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
question and it's it's a simple one and
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
that is in your judgment is it hum
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
inhumane to remove a cat's clause for
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
purely cosmetic reasons or purely for
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
the convenience of the
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
owner I think we're confusing the
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
inhumane in regards to medical
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
procedures by veterinarians if you use
 
04:20:57.630 --> 04:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
that type of definition the majority of
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
medical procedures we do on animals
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
could be considered
 
04:21:04.990 --> 04:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
inhumane simply a cat neuter could be
 
04:21:08.149 --> 04:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
considered inhumane because most of us
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
that have come in contact with a male
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
intact Tom Cat Knows
 
04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
that these cats stink to high heaven you
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
cannot have a male intact C cat in your
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
house and not neuter them and so purely
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
neutering a cat for those
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
reasons is Cosmetic in my
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
opinion so no it's not inhumane
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily to new to declot a cat under
 
04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
proper anesia and anesthesia to declaw a
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
cat in your kitchen yes and I agree with
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
Dr Boer when she made that point as well
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
today follow up follow up thank you with
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
regard to to neutering aren't there
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
numerous uh health reasons and other
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
kind of beneficial byproducts of of
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
neutering for example preventing Mass
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
reproduction of animals that then may
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
not be careed for like neutering is not
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
considered by representative I'd have to
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
G you because that neutering really
 
04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have bearing on this particular
 
04:22:11.239 --> 04:22:12.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't have bearing on this particular
bill

04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
oh I'm confused because she was using
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
neutering as an example of she was
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
talking what what might be considered
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
inhume treatment if I may she she said
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
that neutering could be considered
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
cosmetic and I was asking her how that's
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
the case
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
sorry you had I'm sorry go ahead I I
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
will address that
 
04:22:35.279 --> 04:22:38.269 align:start position:0%
will address that
um

04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:41.229 --> 04:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
when can you repeat your question please
 
04:22:43.229 --> 04:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
go right Ahad just that there are uh are
 
04:22:46.269 --> 04:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
there not a lot of other health benefits
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
and positive benefits to neutering that
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
make it not really considered cosmetic
 
04:22:53.109 --> 04:22:53.119 align:start position:0%
by most veterinarians so when you
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
suggest the health
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
benefits the health benefits of a lot of
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
things are naturally occurring things
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
that animals do animals reproduce and so
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
to use that as an argument that we're
 
04:23:08.429 --> 04:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
population reproduction is a
 
04:23:11.439 --> 04:23:14.349 align:start position:0%
population reproduction is a
normal

04:23:14.349 --> 04:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
normal
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
biological event Behavior just as
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
scratching is a natural behavior for
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
cats so to me that's not necessarily a
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
health benefit to the cat it is a
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
benefit again to the owner because
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're not having unwanted litters thank
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
you representative ktoa thank you madam
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
chair and I am going to go off track and
 
04:23:40.429 --> 04:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
continue on with the line of discussion
 
04:23:43.389 --> 04:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
that we just had um
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
it could be said that the neutering or
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
the spaying of an animal can actually
 
04:23:51.870 --> 04:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
decrease its lifespan is that
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not positive about that
 
04:23:58.830 --> 04:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
information um there's a lot of research
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
being done into delaying spaying and
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
neutering for health benefits um there's
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of research that is being done on
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
looking at retrospective studies um
 
04:24:13.870 --> 04:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there has not been really
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
good data out there because most of
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
these research papers are being done
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
um retrospectively meaning they look
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
back at say a 100 animals and they look
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
back at their records to say when they
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
were spayed when they were neutered um
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
other procedures that they may encounter
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
in their lives are not included and so I
 
04:24:38.349 --> 04:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of information that
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
is being put out
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
there because we're viewing the data um
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
to to reach a means to an ends that we
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
might want to get thank you very much
 
04:24:49.359 --> 04:24:50.469 align:start position:0%
might want to get thank you very much
representative

04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%

represent um every single uh
 
04:24:59.469 --> 04:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian in the state like are they

all members of your
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
Association I represent the

members that I represent the New
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinarians that are members
 
04:25:10.109 --> 04:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
to my
 
04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
Association um could you I don't
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
represent member people that are not
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
members um as of December 31st um that
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
was the end of our our fiscal year um we
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
had over 350 some odd members um you
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
know that are members of of the New
 
04:25:29.229 --> 04:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Veterinary Medical Association
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up do you know how many
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
there are in the state out of if you
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
have 350 are there a thousand vetenarian
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
so from from this the the board of
 
04:25:43.389 --> 04:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine there are over 900
 
04:25:43.399 --> 04:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine there are over 900
member

04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
member
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
board licensed in the state of New
 
04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however because we are a
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
border state um we have many um
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that are are are licensed
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
in other states that don't necessarily
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire um there is
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
really no way unless we go practice to
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
practice to find out how many licens
 
04:26:08.349 --> 04:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that are practicing in New
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are um it's just it's it's
 
04:26:12.269 --> 04:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
very difficult because also our
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
membership in the New Hampshire VMA um
 
04:26:18.429 --> 04:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
we give discounted memberships um to
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
students we also um allow membership
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
from veterinarians from out of state um
 
04:26:27.630 --> 04:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
in order to access our continuing
 
04:26:29.910 --> 04:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
education any other questions uh
 
04:26:32.109 --> 04:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
04:26:34.750 --> 04:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just trying to get the numbers
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
right in my own head do you support the
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
survey in 2020 when asked the specific
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
question of the New Hampshire veterinary
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
medicine Association Medical Association
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
would you approve of New Hampshire
 
04:26:52.830 --> 04:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
making the practice of decla
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
illegal half of them said yes half of
 
04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
them said
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
no I did that survey myself um I was the
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
one that put that survey together and
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
actually the numbers um I believe are 51
 
04:27:08.670 --> 04:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
to 47 um or somewhere in that that area
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
um and the majority were not in favor of
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislating this and so I have to go
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
with my membership um I understand that
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
50% of us or half and half are are are
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
split on this um but again I have to go
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
with my my membership's majority thank
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Penza sorry last
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um I've
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
talked to a lot of constituents about
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
this bill um and it seems as if a lot of
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
people are on board with that would you
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
be amendable do you think the
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
association would be amendable to
 
04:27:45.429 --> 04:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
the state actually Gathering the data
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
like how often it's happening or even
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
just a specific question that's asked
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
out to every board certified licensed
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarian in the state to say are you
 
04:27:59.710 --> 04:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
performing these are you not how are you
 
04:28:02.670 --> 04:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
whatever like would you I would gladly
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
take help um I have been in front of
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:28:05.590 align:start position:0%
take help um I have been in front of
this

04:28:05.590 --> 04:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
committee I more times than I can count
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
I've lost count um and the information I
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
try to gather every single year I can
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
only get the information that I email
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
out to my membership and I can only
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
process the data that I get from the
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
responses I have never been able to get
 
04:28:30.630 --> 04:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
good data from my members I've not been
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
able to get that data at all so I would
 
04:28:35.229 --> 04:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
very much gladly appreciate any help in
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
getting that information for you I have
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
done my darnest to get you accurate
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
information the results that I got from
 
04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
this last survey were from last week and
 
04:28:48.109 --> 04:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
again I can only get data I can't keep
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
sending out survey after survey because
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
the people that respond to
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
surveys are the people that respond to
 
04:28:57.149 --> 04:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
surveys so if I send one out next week
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to probably be the same group
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
of people and I'm not going to get a
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative sample so if there was
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
any way that we could get that
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
information beforehand before any of
 
04:29:09.149 --> 04:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation comes up and I would be
 
04:29:11.710 --> 04:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
more than happy the association would be
 
04:29:13.710 --> 04:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
more than happy to go through any of
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
these resol excuse me I just came back
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
from our own any of these these
 
04:29:18.640 --> 04:29:20.189 align:start position:0%
from our own any of these these
legislative

04:29:20.189 --> 04:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
information before any of this even
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
comes in front of your committee so that
 
04:29:27.389 --> 04:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
we can actually present a bill that
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has the information and I ask
 
04:29:32.429 --> 04:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
every single year for the sponsors to
 
04:29:35.229 --> 04:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
come meet with us as an association meet
 
04:29:36.790 --> 04:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the Board of veter Medicine before
 
04:29:38.830 --> 04:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
this even gets to in front of you so
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not wasting time going
 
04:29:44.670 --> 04:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
through data that is way out a date 5
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
years in the veter medicine medical
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
profession changes a lot things change
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
rapidly and that information that I got
 
04:29:57.269 --> 04:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
five years ago is wildly wildly
 
04:29:57.279 --> 04:29:59.790 align:start position:0%
five years ago is wildly wildly
wildly

04:29:59.790 --> 04:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
wildly
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
inaccurate just as medical procedures
 
04:30:04.750 --> 04:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
happen change in five
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
years so I'll be glad to take the help
 
04:30:11.469 --> 04:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to help create a bill if
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
that's what this body wants but nobody
 
04:30:19.349 --> 04:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:19.359 --> 04:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
never

04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
never
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you appreciate it and I
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
do have written I have testimony from
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%

it from rochest sister could that be
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
cook yes that would be me and if if
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
you've heard something before that you
 
04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:57.070 --> 04:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
again I have been accused of that before
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
in my life but try
 
04:31:02.429 --> 04:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
to not do that uh my name is Robert cook
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
I live in c k okay I'm a resident of
 
04:31:09.510 --> 04:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester I'm a licensed Forester for
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
the state in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:31:15.389 --> 04:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
um and just a couple of words I like to
 
04:31:15.399 --> 04:31:19.189 align:start position:0%
um and just a couple of words I like to
say

04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
um talking comparing the um neutering
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
with declawing neutering is a surgical
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
procedure that is done on anesthesia and
 
04:31:32.109 --> 04:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
typically there are no lasting effects
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
from that the lasting effects from
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
declawing I have seen firsthand I
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer in at least two animal
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
shelters I'm also a member of the New
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire disaster animal response team
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
if you want and the second thing about
 
04:31:49.149 --> 04:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
what was said before me you know try to
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
get the numbers try to get the numbers
 
04:31:52.510 --> 04:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
try to get the numbers the definition of
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
insanity is trying to do the same thing
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
over and over and getting the same
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
result if you want numbers pull the
 
04:32:02.830 --> 04:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
shelters in the state veterinaries
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
perform the procedures and get paid for
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
it shelters deal with the outcome and
 
04:32:10.269 --> 04:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
it there's more animals that are
 
04:32:16.510 --> 04:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
surrendered to shelters because they h
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
cats because they have been declawed
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
rather than because they're scratching a
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
sofa it's it is a in the veterinary
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
textbooks it says is an
 
04:32:30.429 --> 04:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
amputation so it's literally amputating
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
all 10 fingers if
 
04:32:32.520 --> 04:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
all 10 fingers if
not

04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
more how is that and there are
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that's medically
 
04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
necessary it's a very small percentage
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
and yet the large percentage of the
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
procedures that have been done have not
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
been because it's medically necessary
 
04:32:50.189 --> 04:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
this bill has the out for medically
 
04:32:52.510 --> 04:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
necessary that still gives the
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarians the legal and um medical
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
reasons for performing this procedure if
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
it needs to be
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
done but go to a shelter see a cat who's
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
been walking on their wrists for years
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
because they cannot walk so many cats
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
get surrendered to shelter is because
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
they go to the bathroom outside the
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
litter box why do they do that because
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
they can't do what's natural in the in
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
litter behavioral problems
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
they're if you if you want numbers and
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is so
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
this your numbers are is it being done
 
04:33:35.470 --> 04:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
in the state is it not being done in the
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
state go to a shelter you see cats get
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
surrendered it's being done in this
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
state do you need to know how many you
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
know that this cruel and unusual
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
punishment is being done and you have
 
04:33:51.869 --> 04:33:51.879 align:start position:0%
the ability to stop it thank you and
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for being our Representatives
 
04:33:56.349 --> 04:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
this is civic duty at its best thank you
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%

Snider hello thank you for having me
 
04:34:31.600 --> 04:34:32.949 align:start position:0%
Snider hello thank you for having me
today

04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say real quickly that
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
a few days ago when I knew this bill was
 
04:34:40.590 --> 04:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
coming up I it only took me 5 minutes to
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
find two veterinarians that do this
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
procedure and that was a simple Google
 
04:34:46.709 --> 04:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
search and then one of them actually
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
even had a Google review where someone
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
wrote up that they had the procedure
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
done so clearly this is being done how
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
much I don't know but like uh someone
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
before me said one is too many it's
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
happening absolutely it's happening and
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is animal cruelty as far
 
04:35:08.349 --> 04:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned it's animal mutilation
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
if you were to go out into the wild and
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
you were to chop off the fingers of a
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
raccoon or a bobcat that would fit under
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
the animal cruelty statute and that
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
could be up to a felony charge so here
 
04:35:22.349 --> 04:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
we are doing it with house cats you know
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's those loopholes those famous
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
loopholes where it's it's animal cruelty
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
here but it's not animal cruelty here
 
04:35:32.109 --> 04:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
and um I did have a cat that was
 
04:35:34.910 --> 04:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
declawed and I adopted him when he was
 
04:35:37.470 --> 04:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
two and I watched him suffer his whole
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
life and I will say this I think there
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
was someone speaking before me that says
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
this might reduce their lifespan my cat
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
lived to 24 years old and especially the
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
last few years of his life he suffered
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
badly because he had Pro problems
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
walking on his
 
04:35:57.390 --> 04:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
paws and towards the last week or two of
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
his life he lost the
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
fur the fur was gone from his paws and
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
you could see the knuckles boom there
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
was nothing there and it was awful
 
04:36:11.629 --> 04:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
because I had to make the decision do I
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
put him down do I keep him alive and it
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
it was this is horrific thing to do and
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
I always you know I mentioned this last
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
time I said if I had when I got that cat
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
and I saw how much he was suffering
 
04:36:24.750 --> 04:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
without those
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
claws that if I had one choice between
 
04:36:30.189 --> 04:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
someone giving me a million dollars or
 
04:36:33.551 --> 04:36:33.561 align:start position:0%
giving my cat his claws back hands down
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
I would give my cat his claws
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
back this is just it it's it's
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
unbearable to me that we are here
 
04:36:41.080 --> 04:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
unbearable to me that we are here
constantly

04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
doing this same bill wasting taxpayer
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
money sitting here for 3 hours going
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
over the same testimony there is a very
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
easy solution for that pass something
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
please please because I already I'm got
 
04:36:57.070 --> 04:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
to tell you right now I have two State
 
04:36:59.470 --> 04:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
reps ready to do this again that's two
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
more two more years that this is going
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
to happen something has to be done
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
please please do this and I will say
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
that I I kind of I'm kind of curious
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
ious about why you know the we don't
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
deal with facts we deal with what if
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
slippery slope we deal with these things
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
the facts are this is being done the
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
facts are this is mutilation of an
 
04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
animal and the fact is that these
 
04:37:26.240 --> 04:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
animal and the fact is that these
animals

04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
suffer please do something please stop
 
04:37:34.349 --> 04:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
this from happening I am begging you if
 
04:37:36.910 --> 04:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
if you had seen I I wish I had taken
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
pictures of his paw I mean that cat was
 
04:37:44.349 --> 04:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
my baby he was my baby so it's very hard
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
for me to listen to some of this you
 
04:37:48.590 --> 04:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
know a slippery slope nobody knows
 
04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen 5 seconds from
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
now the roof could cave in Nobody Knows
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
the future if you legislate on slippery
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
slope what what does that do no bills
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
would ever be heard because anyone could
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
make that argument we are here dealing
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
with this today we are talking about
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
cats not dogs dogs is a separate species
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
this is a cat
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm just going to leave with
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
again this bill will keep coming around
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
on that lazy sus in the circle I'll make
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
sure of it and I owe that to my cat
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you thank you madam chair
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I'm
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
sorry um when um when did you adopt the
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
cat like when was that I I adopted the
 
04:38:36.840 --> 04:38:38.029 align:start position:0%
cat like when was that I I adopted the
cat

04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
cat
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
2019 so um you know he was in it was in
 
04:38:51.750 --> 04:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
the '90s that I adopted him and you know
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
maybe the procedure has gotten better
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
but you know I got to tell you it sounds
 
04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
a little wonky to me to say oh now it's
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's better because they only do
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
this they only do this if it's anything
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
more than Nail clipping something is
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
being done something serious is being
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
done to that cat you know and as far as
 
04:39:12.990 --> 04:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
well spay and neuter
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
humans we get you know males get
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
vasectomies I mean it's it's a it's a
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
bizarre thing to use that as some kind
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
of a an argument to say why we should
 
04:39:26.670 --> 04:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
you know keep this procedure in place
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
and as far as you know there's a
 
04:39:30.429 --> 04:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and the owner and it's
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
between them there's a third party it's
 
04:39:35.629 --> 04:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
called the cat cat can't talk to us the
 
04:39:37.470 --> 04:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
cat can't tell us please don't take off
 
04:39:40.030 --> 04:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
my my fingers you know I'm sure that if
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
the cat actually could talk to us would
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
say yeah I I really want to keep my
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
fingers please so you know I
 
04:39:51.510 --> 04:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
I I really urge you again please pass
 
04:39:51.520 --> 04:39:52.868 align:start position:0%
I I really urge you again please pass

you for having us be able to come here
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
and give
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm here to talk about
 
04:40:34.590 --> 04:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge of watching the
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
aftermath right after the cat has its
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
cat it claw declaw sorry um so I went to
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
school at UNH for a degree in animal
 
04:40:48.750 --> 04:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
science and I had a job um right
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards at a local here in conquered
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
animal hospital and I worked out back
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
and I was in charge of cleaning the
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
kennels um checking on the animals after
 
04:41:00.670 --> 04:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
surgery and I can't tell you how many
 
04:41:04.030 --> 04:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
times that the they were mostly the
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
young cats getting declawed and they
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
would be all bandaged up have these big
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
bandages on them and they would be
 
04:41:12.430 --> 04:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
wailing as they're coming out of the
 
04:41:14.670 --> 04:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and they would be like kind
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
of banging their hands trying to get the
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
bandages off kind of out of it and the
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
cage would be full of blood like they
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
would manage to somehow get the bandages
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
off from scraping across it then they
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
would have to go take them and rebandage
 
04:41:30.670 --> 04:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
them sometimes even another time after
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that and it didn't happen one or two
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
times like it happens in most of the
 
04:41:38.430 --> 04:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
cats they would just be wailing it was
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
just an awful sight and I mean blood
 
04:41:40.560 --> 04:41:41.910 align:start position:0%
just an awful sight and I mean blood
everywhere

04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's going to make it even
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
worse trying to get that to heal up
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
because they're you know aggravating
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
that Sutra site and it just happened so
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
much and I just felt so bad for these
 
04:41:55.070 --> 04:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
cats I don't know what the veterinarians
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
I never asked them about what they
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
thought of that cuz I'm sure they knew
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
that that was happening all the time um
 
04:42:03.070 --> 04:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to speak to that
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge of witnessing the um
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
cats right afterwards getting the the
 
04:42:11.868 --> 04:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
cat declaw procedure done uh was just
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
horrible so please pass this Bill thank
 
04:42:17.110 --> 04:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
you how long ago was that that you were
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh working in that um facility yeah I
 
04:42:21.310 --> 04:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you wanted me to name the
 
04:42:23.550 --> 04:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
facility but it was in conquered um it
 
04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
was the early
 
04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
1990s so I'm not sure if they still
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
perform it the same way I I mean there's
 
04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
only so many ways you can cut to the
 
04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
first knuckle I mean it's I would
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
imagine still the same procedure maybe
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
the bandaging is differently now but
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for coming thank you
 
04:42:49.628 --> 04:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank you uh
 
04:42:49.638 --> 04:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank you uh
Tony

04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.990 --> 04:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
mclen good afternoon my name is Tony
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
mclen I'm a resident of New Hampshire
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to voice my support
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
for HB 2011 it is an important bill and
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
the time has come the ban on declawing
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
needs to happen it's a cruel and
 
04:43:21.040 --> 04:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
needs to happen it's a cruel and
inhumane

04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
inhumane
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
practice and I know this firsthand so if
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
you can imagine your fingers being cut
 
04:43:32.990 --> 04:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
off at the first knuckle and in many
 
04:43:36.270 --> 04:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
cases it's the fingers and toes cut off
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
and then if you imagine you being sent
 
04:43:41.788 --> 04:43:41.798 align:start position:0%
out there saying go live your life
 
04:43:44.750 --> 04:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
this practice needs to stop and how do I
 
04:43:46.510 --> 04:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
know that it's cruel and inhumane
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
because I've witnessed the surgery many
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
times and I've witnessed the outcome of
 
04:43:56.430 --> 04:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
it I most of my career I've been a
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
wildlife biologist for 25 years so I
 
04:44:02.590 --> 04:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
sought firsthand in wild cats and it
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
crippled them and killed them in many
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
cases some of them couldn't even get to
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
their water bowl and they died
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
crippled from this
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
procedure and in the case of domestic
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
animals I served as the Director of
 
04:44:21.550 --> 04:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
operations for a very large animal
 
04:44:25.150 --> 04:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
shelter taking in over 4,000 animals a
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
year and Contracting with 22 towns with
 
04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
those 22 towns whether it was the Animal
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
control officer a veterinarian a police
 
04:44:38.110 --> 04:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
officer or resident we could not say no
 
04:44:41.550 --> 04:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
to that animal we had to take it in
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
and many of them were declawed cats
 
04:44:47.550 --> 04:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
being returned this is not an N of one
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
this is an N of
 
04:44:51.868 --> 04:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
thousands and I saw the
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
aftermath their paw the surgery as I
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
know it today is still a cut off at the
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
knuckle and it is still brutal many of
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
these animals were returned to the
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
shelter because they a very fear of well
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
scratching or biting my baby or my
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
toddler well they didn't before but they
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
did after so they were returned to the
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
shelter can't they're urinating
 
04:45:24.910 --> 04:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
defecating outside the litter
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
box why because it's too painful to go
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
inside the litter
 
04:45:33.628 --> 04:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
box the pain after the procedure some
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
with pain meds some without even with
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
constant pain medication the cat's
 
04:45:42.750 --> 04:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
writhing in pain howling throughout
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
their lives so because I at the shelter
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
as director I would not euthanize these
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
cats I ended up with many of them and
 
04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
they led a life of pain and again this
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
isn't an N of one it's an N of
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
thousands and it is cruel inhumane and
 
04:46:03.868 --> 04:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
what does it say about us as a people as
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
a culture if we don't stop this cruel
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
inhumane treatment and there is that
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
provision in there that when it's
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
medically necessary go ahead and do
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
it all that is necessary as this quote
 
04:46:21.390 --> 04:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
that I love so much goes all that is
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
necessary for evil to Prevail in this
 
04:46:31.230 --> 04:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
nothing and I'll just end with there
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
there is data out there and I would be
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
happy to provide that not only what I
 
04:46:42.750 --> 04:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
saw firsthand at the shelter thousands
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
because we took in many years almost
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
5,000 animals most of which were
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
cats so I'll just end with a quote from
 
04:46:56.350 --> 04:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
the great Martin Luther King laws cannot
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
change Hearts but they can restrain the
 
04:47:02.190 --> 04:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
heartless thank you for the opportunity
 
04:47:02.200 --> 04:47:03.150 align:start position:0%
heartless thank you for the opportunity
to

04:47:03.150 --> 04:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:05.788 --> 04:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
comment thank you any questions from the
 
04:47:08.350 --> 04:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for coming and thank
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
you for sharing your testimony I was
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
very much interested in the perspective
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
of a shelter operator is it easier to
 
04:47:27.548 --> 04:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
get a cat adopted with or without
 
04:47:32.110 --> 04:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
claws it there are a lot of uh people
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
that ask for
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
declawing um or declawed cats so what I
 
04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
implemented after seeing the effects of
 
04:47:40.160 --> 04:47:41.350 align:start position:0%
implemented after seeing the effects of
declawing

04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
declawing
 
04:47:44.270 --> 04:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
I implemented a no adoption policy if
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
their intent was to declaw now could I
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
control that after they left the shelter
 
04:47:54.190 --> 04:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
no but those cats often returned and
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
when they returned who wants to adopt a
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
cat that is urinating or defecating
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
outside the box or that's writhing in
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
pain or that has behavioral issues and
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
now they bite and scratch much more than
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
they did before no one so I ended up
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of these cats and in many
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
shelters I refused to do it but in many
 
04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
shelters they're euthanized so when the
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
word got out shelters started bringing
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
their cats to us because they knew we
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't euthanize a declawed
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
cat followup yeah yeah thank you I I
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't precise in what I was asking you
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
you the cats that you had that had
 
04:48:38.548 --> 04:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
already been declawed did people come in
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
and take them was there like did they
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
take those cats more than the clawed
 
04:48:44.788 --> 04:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
ones the ones that still at Claws and
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the ones that did take the declawed
 
04:48:47.708 --> 04:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
cats did they bring them back to you
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
because they found out they had problems
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
anticipating I wouldn't say that more
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
adopted decla than and than that still
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
had their claws a lot of people ask for
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
declawed cats but um when discussing
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
what declaws did and seeing the cats
 
04:49:08.430 --> 04:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
when they went to adopt them their
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
favorite cat maybe they wanted that
 
04:49:12.430 --> 04:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
particular Main or what have you
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
when they saw their behavior or how they
 
04:49:18.670 --> 04:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
reacted they didn't adopt them but more
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the second part of your
 
04:49:20.080 --> 04:49:21.590 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the second part of your
question

04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
again I didn't know if there was also a
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
a high return rate for people who did
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
take a declawed cat from your
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
shelter yes there was unfortunately yes
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
there was a high return rate thank
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%

04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
question represent Venza do you still

04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
right before that it was nine years ago
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Penza that was
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
my question okay there you go any other
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank you I
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
have one last comment I yearly I make a
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
point to call 8 to 10 veterinarians to
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
see just I'm a resident do you can I
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
declaw my cat and the answer most always
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
nine out of 10 is yes I
 
04:50:29.110 --> 04:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
declaw thank
 
04:50:32.510 --> 04:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
you uh call Lauren
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
Martin you asked for three minutes I'll
 
04:50:37.470 --> 04:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
be quick most of what I wanted to say is
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
said thank
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
you um so my name is Lauren Martin I
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
live in Amherst New Hampshire um and I
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
am here to testify in support of hb21 I
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
have had cats my entire life um animals
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
in general I'm a big proponent of animal
 
04:50:55.948 --> 04:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
welfare and I believe decla is inhumane
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
um more often than not the only reason
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
people seek to declaw their cat is due
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
to scratching and cats are constantly
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
growing and shedding their claws so if
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's just not something people can
 
04:51:08.670 --> 04:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
deal with I think it's hard to at that
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
point own a cat but there are so many
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives at this point that
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
declawing just shouldn't be necessary
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
you can get nail caps which go over the
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
claw they are dull they are rubber
 
04:51:21.628 --> 04:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
they're not going to hurt you um you can
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
add more acceptable scratching surfaces
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
to your own home just routinely trimming
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
the claws yourself or your veterinarian
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
is so simple and so many hospitals
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
including Blue Pearl and the VCA have
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
banned declawing 42 countries and states
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
like Maryland New York most recently in
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
the past month Massachusetts have banned
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
it and I I think that's also another
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
point that should be brought up now that
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is outlawing declawing
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're their border state if they want to
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
declaw and there are still people here
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
offering it those people are going to
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
come here to do it I think at this point
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
um it has been acknowledged that this is
 
04:51:59.470 --> 04:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
inhumane and should not continue so I
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
greatly urge you to support hb21 thank
 
04:52:04.350 --> 04:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
today a representative Christine silbert
 
04:52:14.830 --> 04:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
oh she left okay uh Joan O'Brien New
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rights animals League New
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.830 --> 04:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you chair Aaron and members of
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
the committee for allowing me to
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
speak uh so I'm Joan O'Brien from
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
Amherst and I am uh here representing
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire animal rights league
 
04:52:56.350 --> 04:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
and we're in support of
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
hp21 uh the New Hampshire animal rights
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
League was formed almost 50 years ago in
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
1977 with the goal of protecting animals
 
04:53:04.638 --> 04:53:07.830 align:start position:0%
1977 with the goal of protecting animals
from

04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
harm retiring the declaw procceed
 
04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
will not only protect countless cats
 
04:53:16.830 --> 04:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
from disfigurement it might also save
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
the lives of some
 
04:53:21.548 --> 04:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
veterinarians veterinarians face the
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
highest suicide rate of any profession
 
04:53:26.548 --> 04:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
it's a high stress job takes an
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
emotional toll on them watching animals
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
suffer and
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
die and another contributing factor is
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
being forced to perform procedures that
 
04:53:38.430 --> 04:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
you ethically oppose and in some
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
practices if the if the practice does
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
declaw you have to perform them because
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
you work
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
there and one Veterinary wrote on a
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
message board I think killing myself
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
might be the only way to stop the pain I
 
04:53:58.270 --> 04:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.750 --> 04:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
cats so is it happening in New Hampshire
 
04:54:02.590 --> 04:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing this quite a bit
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what number would be
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
enough we've had all sorts of anecdotal
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh numbers today uh the a 20 24 Wall
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
Street Journal article said that
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
22% of this country's 100 million cats
 
04:54:16.760 --> 04:54:17.868 align:start position:0%
22% of this country's 100 million cats
are

04:54:17.868 --> 04:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
declawed some are here a random phone
 
04:54:25.150 --> 04:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
survey that was done in 2023 of 20 vets
 
04:54:27.548 --> 04:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
turned up five who declaw in New
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're at the end of my
 
04:54:32.548 --> 04:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
testimony and a few days ago I called uh
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
black rocks Veterinary Hospital in
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
Fremont and the woman who answered told
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
Clause so why don't we just wait for
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
this to go away on its own I mean you
 
04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
know it's falling out of favor
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
right uh we can just keep educating and
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
just waiting um and as rep pretends are
 
04:54:52.150 --> 04:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
brought up you know they don't teach it
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
in in vet school anymore but I think
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
that doing nothing would be a great
 
04:54:59.310 --> 04:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
disservice to cats and our constituents
 
04:55:01.470 --> 04:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
who are the more majority of are in
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
favor of of banning this
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
procedure enacting the law is essential
 
04:55:08.350 --> 04:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
to send the powerful societal message
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
that decla is unacceptable and the law
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
is the most efficient way and expedient
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
way to just stop this
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
practice I I don't I'm not in favor of
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of an amendment about human
 
04:55:26.830 --> 04:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
health only because the CDC um does not
 
04:55:29.470 --> 04:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
recommend declawing in the case of imuno
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
compromised people or people on blood
 
04:55:35.110 --> 04:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
thinners and and in addition that the
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
National Institutes of Health does not
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
recommend it and a few others that I
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
listed in my testimony they recommend
 
04:55:43.280 --> 04:55:47.150 align:start position:0%
listed in my testimony they recommend
behavior

04:55:47.150 --> 04:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
modification sometimes people will say
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
well isn't it better than you know the
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
cat getting euthanized I I think that's
 
04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
a false dichotomy that comes up all the
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
time that there are other options it's
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
not an either
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
or if uh you know if you can't manage
 
04:56:05.230 --> 04:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
the cat's
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior like for example you have a
 
04:56:09.628 --> 04:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
child and the child keeps pulling the
 
04:56:11.430 --> 04:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
cat's tail and the cat's going to
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
scratch them you ask yourself you know
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
is causing this cat pain and removing a
 
04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
body part is is that what I want to do
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
or should I just give the cat a better
 
04:56:23.470 --> 04:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
home a different
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
home and there was a study done in
 
04:56:27.868 --> 04:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
British Colombia where they have banned
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
declawing that actually showed it was
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
done in
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
2022 that um the number of surrenders
 
04:56:39.150 --> 04:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
after a cat's declawed uh it the number
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
of surrenders did not go did not change
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the number of owners decided to
 
04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
euthanize actually went down after they
 
04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
passed this ban for decline in British
 
04:56:54.310 --> 04:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
Columbia one more Point uh will decline
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
be bad for business uh reportedly we
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't have enough veterinarians and vet
 
04:57:01.830 --> 04:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
tax in New Hampshire to meet the the
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
demand um so removing decline from the
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
menu shouldn't put anybody out of
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
business and great positive note they
 
04:57:12.510 --> 04:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
can do restruc reconstructive paw
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
surgery now so that could be um a new
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
service that veterinarians could offer
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
to fill out their their uh you know
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
their menu so thank you and uh please
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
support the bill so we can relegate this
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
debilitating surgery to a sad chapter in
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
Veterinary history thank you thank you
 
04:57:31.470 --> 04:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
04:57:33.470 --> 04:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
none thank you appreciate you coming
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
in uh one more pink card card today for
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
owners and my apologies to those waiting
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
for the uh recess Bill uh that we had
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
earlier today we will get to that
 
04:57:54.798 --> 04:57:56.430 align:start position:0%
earlier today we will get to that
shortly

04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
04:58:00.190 --> 04:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'll make it quick um so just
 
04:58:02.350 --> 04:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
to reintroduce myself Angela Ferrari dog
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
owners of the granite state but I do
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that we do have
 
04:58:08.030 --> 04:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
membership who are cat owners and cat
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
breeders and they were definitely um
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
included in our position on this bill
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
which is that we do oppose it um a lot
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
of great information has already been
 
04:58:22.470 --> 04:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
covered so I'm not going to go into my
 
04:58:25.310 --> 04:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
full testimony I did pass out a copy but
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
I do want to remind everyone that the
 
04:58:31.150 --> 04:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
medical professionals in the industry
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
with the veterinarians do need to
 
04:58:35.910 --> 04:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
maintain their autonomy to also maintain
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
that vet patient relationship in making
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
these type of decisions
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
um in all of my own animal ownership I
 
04:58:46.590 --> 04:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
take what my vet shares with me for
 
04:58:48.510 --> 04:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge education
 
04:58:51.150 --> 04:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation um to heart when we're
 
04:58:54.030 --> 04:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
deciding what is appropriate for my cat
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
or my dog um I do think it's important
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
to reiterate that 8-year-old outdated
 
04:59:02.430 --> 04:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
information or data shouldn't be
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
considered as part of this bill and that
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
more recent data as shared by the New
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire VMA shows 20% or less per
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
forming uh these procedures when we did
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
our own calls to try and identify if
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
there were veterinarians uh just doing a
 
04:59:21.948 --> 04:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
local call we did not find any who were
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
doing it so I think you know there's
 
04:59:25.788 --> 04:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
definitely some data collection that
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
could be done um I do think that we
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
would support doing that type of
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
collection um to make sure that we're
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
making decisions based on facts because
 
04:59:38.230 --> 04:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
over the past 5 years that we've heard
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
this bill this being the fourth time
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
we've never had that data and it's
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
always been very skewed and seemed that
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
there was very minimal procedures
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire um I did want
 
04:59:54.548 --> 04:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
to mention regarding the procedure just
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
to remove the nail itself that is
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
considered an onic ectomy and I probably
 
05:00:02.830 --> 05:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
pronounced that wrong and that is listed
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
in here so that would be the newest
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
version of the ability to remove
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
strictly a claw without move removing
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
Knuckles or anything like that and doing
 
05:00:14.670 --> 05:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
the gluing procedure um that would still
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
be banned as part of this
 
05:00:20.990 --> 05:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I do also want to mention that
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
the av's position is that there's no
 
05:00:26.190 --> 05:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence that decline leads
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
to behavioral abnormalities when it is
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh compared to cats outside of the
 
05:00:34.270 --> 05:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
control group and that the survey that
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
they did only found 1% of cat owners
 
05:00:38.628 --> 05:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
reported behavioral changes After
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
Decline so I think with Advanced
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
Technologies to do procedures properly
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
um they're not seeing the numbers that
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
were being seen in the 9s one the 90s
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
the procedures were a lot different and
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
it was a very popular procedure we've
 
05:00:57.390 --> 05:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
seen humongous Decline and people even
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
being interested in the procedure let
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
alone the vets that are actually doing
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
the procedure at this time um so I don't
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
think we should be comparing data from
 
05:01:07.708 --> 05:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
what people were seeing in the
 
05:01:11.470 --> 05:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
9s um another in resting point you know
 
05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's been mentioned that there's a lot
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
of declawed cats that end up in the
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
shelters in 2023 the Department of
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
Agriculture here in New Hampshire um the
 
05:01:25.548 --> 05:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner reported that 15
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
1,596 cats were imported into the state
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
so I just want to raise that piece of
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
data for people to realize that if the
 
05:01:35.788 --> 05:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
shelters are seeing an issue with
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
declawed cats in the shelters the
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
probability that those cats are coming
 
05:01:43.628 --> 05:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
from Southern States where they're still
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
performing the procedure at high rates
 
05:01:48.070 --> 05:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's likely why those cats are ending
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
up in New Hampshire shelters not because
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
the procedure is being done in New
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and people are relinquishing
 
05:01:57.628 --> 05:01:57.638 align:start position:0%
their cats to the shelters and um two
 
05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
last pieces one I don't think it's very
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
professional or appropriate for us to be
 
05:02:04.270 --> 05:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
threatened here that this bill is going
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
to keep coming back if it doesn't make
 
05:02:08.110 --> 05:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
it through this committee today we've
 
05:02:10.510 --> 05:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
already seen it four times we don't want
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
to see it again but I don't think that
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
we should be making legislative
 
05:02:16.788 --> 05:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
decisions because somebody says that
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to make us go through this
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
process again next year um and the last
 
05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
thing dog owners of the granite state
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
does believe that this is a gateway bill
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
that is going to open up not only this
 
05:02:30.390 --> 05:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
procedure down the road but other
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
procedures such as uh crop dock
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
artificial insemination debarking um and
 
05:02:39.390 --> 05:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
then we get into the farming as well
 
05:02:41.708 --> 05:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
we've got teeth nipping
 
05:02:44.430 --> 05:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
dehorning um amongst other things so
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
this really is a gateway to just start
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
adding in other PE other procedures to
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and that continues to
 
05:02:54.910 --> 05:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
deteriorate the professional autonomy of
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians and that that patient
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
relationship so with that I would take
 
05:03:02.190 --> 05:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
for taking questions I'm really glad
 
05:03:08.190 --> 05:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
that you're the last person um speaking
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
today um being an opponent of the bill
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
the reason why is because there's one
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
group of people that I found
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
interestingly absent today and that is
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
anybody who um has had this procedure
 
05:03:23.868 --> 05:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
and just had fantastic results and said
 
05:03:26.430 --> 05:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
that their cat lived happy healthy lives
 
05:03:28.868 --> 05:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
painfree um why are there none of them
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
here today well I actually can speak to
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
that point I wanted to stick kind of to
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
the other type of facts but um when I
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
grew up in the '90s we had a who was
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
dclaw his name was Biffy and I have
 
05:03:45.548 --> 05:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned him to this group before um at
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
prior bills but he lived a completely
 
05:03:51.310 --> 05:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
normal happy life we never had any
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
issues with him uh he could climb trees
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
he could catch Chipmunks and he lived
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
into old age happily um we had other
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
cats that weren't declawed but for you
 
05:04:05.310 --> 05:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
know whatever reason my father decided
 
05:04:08.670 --> 05:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
that Biffy needed to be declawed but he
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
had no issues and he actually outlived
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
the other two cats that had claws
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
clearly not related but it didn't impact
 
05:04:19.470 --> 05:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
his quality of life in anyway now we
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
don't decla our cats that we have we
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
haven't had a reason to um but that is
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
an example and if you would like to hear
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
from people who have had more positive
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
experiences I can reach out and try and
 
05:04:33.868 --> 05:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
have them contact
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
wheeler I just wanted to say I'm no
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
ComEd but I think it would be funny if
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
there was one here to make a joke about
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
the dog owners being opposed to the
 
05:04:44.638 --> 05:04:45.750 align:start position:0%
the dog owners being opposed to the
catel

05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
catel
 
05:04:48.788 --> 05:04:48.798 align:start position:0%

05:04:50.670 --> 05:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
breeders and owners in I know and I
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't mean to disrespect your opposition
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
you brought up good testimony it gets
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
brought up each year because of the name
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
of our group
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you Kelly uh represent Penza
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:02.270 align:start position:0%

I'm
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
sorry it's okay Madam chair I do that
 
05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
stuff all the time um just a quick
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
question because um it was based upon
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you gave in regards
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the shelters taking in you know
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
1500 some OD from
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
um why not part of the reporting piece
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we're you know that a lot of us are
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
talking about so we could actually have
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
hard facts wouldn't it be great to
 
05:05:28.270 --> 05:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
encorporate right now today
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
2025 how many cats are in shelters and
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
how many are declawed whether they you
 
05:05:35.708 --> 05:05:35.718 align:start position:0%
know and of course they'll know if it's
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire cat or if it's if it
 
05:05:39.868 --> 05:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
came from another state with wouldn't
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
that be great information for us to all
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
have to make our
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
decisions I mean I don't see why not as
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
long as you know we're we do know where
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
that cat came from who was declaw
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
because I think we would see that it's
 
05:05:55.670 --> 05:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
not a New Hampshire issue it's not
 
05:05:57.548 --> 05:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
something that's being done in New
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire creating a problem in shelters
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire that those cats are
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
being imported in but it would
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
definitely be a valid piece of
 
05:06:11.070 --> 05:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
data thank you any other questions
 
05:06:12.910 --> 05:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
coming today this afternoon um can I get
 
05:06:25.230 --> 05:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
hearing and I want to just report that
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%

shows 152 people in support of this bill
 
05:06:34.548 --> 05:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
and 95
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%

05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
on uh hb21 prohibiting the removal of
 
05:06:58.830 --> 05:06:58.840 align:start position:0%

applicant to submit a report listing
 
05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
potential harms and benefits of the
 
05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
project so we're going to switch
 
05:07:17.310 --> 05:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%

director
 
05:07:31.548 --> 05:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
whimet as he was the last person to
 
05:07:34.150 --> 05:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
testify and I believe uh the committee
 
05:07:37.868 --> 05:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
may have had some further questions
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
regarding um
 
05:07:43.628 --> 05:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
getting um potential harms and benefits
 
05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
reports for pro pro projects being
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
considered uh for landfill permits so
 
05:07:53.670 --> 05:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
did anybody from the committee have any
 
05:07:53.680 --> 05:07:54.990 align:start position:0%
did anybody from the committee have any
further

05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:07:58.230 --> 05:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%

05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
being yet another half hour late thank
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh so I just had one or
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
two more questions um I'll ask you one
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
is we were just about to speak about the
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
issue of um in the legis draft
 
05:08:24.910 --> 05:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislation of of appointing a
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
independent third party to do this
 
05:08:31.510 --> 05:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of of the uh net public
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
benefit and it doesn't say who would
 
05:08:38.030 --> 05:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
hire this this firm or individual in in
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
the draft legislation so I was going to
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
ask you your thoughts about whe whether
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
that uh it does say that would be paid
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
for by the contractor so my question to
 
05:08:49.470 --> 05:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
you do you think it'd be best for Dees
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
to um be the person who chooses this
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
person to do this analysis that's um in
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
line I don't have line numbers I guess
 
05:09:00.910 --> 05:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
here that's under
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
d uh second
 
05:09:07.150 --> 05:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
line line 14 line
 
05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
14 yeah I thank you for the question
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
question I agree with you it's not clear
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
from the language in the bill who
 
05:09:15.948 --> 05:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
actually selects or hires that person as
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
as I read it now um again is what it
 
05:09:22.270 --> 05:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
suggests is that a third party um
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
independent third party would conduct it
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the host Community or other
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
AB budding municipalities so I I I don't
 
05:09:30.590 --> 05:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to speak I don't know what the
 
05:09:32.430 --> 05:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent was so I'm not sure I
 
05:09:34.548 --> 05:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that do you think so
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
you don't know whether it' be best for
 
05:09:38.230 --> 05:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
the hency to choose the individual or
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
the uh part that's being um uh
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
requesting to permit I guess I would be
 
05:09:47.430 --> 05:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about the agency
 
05:09:50.548 --> 05:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
selecting I I don't know how much or if
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
we have any expertise and and or
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the sort of Consulting
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
community that might be likely to do
 
05:10:00.750 --> 05:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of work um you know there's
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
never a perfect way to do this if if the
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
agency were to select a particular
 
05:10:07.390 --> 05:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
company based on whatever criteria were
 
05:10:09.708 --> 05:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
provided um some some people would
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
probably be happy with that selection
 
05:10:12.510 --> 05:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
and others might not depending on
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
whether they thought it was a good
 
05:10:15.868 --> 05:10:15.878 align:start position:0%
selection or not um right now I'm not
 
05:10:17.760 --> 05:10:17.770 align:start position:0%
sure that I really know
 
05:10:17.770 --> 05:10:19.030 align:start position:0%
sure that I really know
[Music]

05:10:19.030 --> 05:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
who what companies and what what what
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
what sector of the uh Private Industry
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know would be qualified to do this
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
work have a quick followup that's okay
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
quick followup sure quick followup is
 
05:10:33.788 --> 05:10:33.798 align:start position:0%
that that uh I thought the same thing
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
over lunch and uh and I was found out
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
three groups for example uh Society of
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
risk analysis Society for benefit cost
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
analysis or the National Association of
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
environmental professionals groups like
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure you know of many of these
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
groups could they be helpful at kind of
 
05:10:51.310 --> 05:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
identifying a pool of contractors that
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
actually have the capacity to do the
 
05:10:55.470 --> 05:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
work properly I I suspect they could
 
05:10:57.548 --> 05:10:57.558 align:start position:0%
sure I don't have personal knowledge
 
05:10:59.548 --> 05:10:59.558 align:start position:0%
that but I I'd anticipate that folks
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
like that would have some good ideas
 
05:11:03.788 --> 05:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
okay thanks okay questions
 
05:11:03.798 --> 05:11:05.310 align:start position:0%
okay thanks okay questions
representative

05:11:05.310 --> 05:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
director for being here again this
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon um so I've been going through
 
05:11:17.070 --> 05:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and I have a question for you
 
05:11:19.628 --> 05:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm having a hard time defining
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
something net public benefit can you
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
means no I can't I mean again I I didn't
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
draft the bill so I don't know what is
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
intended and I don't want to speak for
 
05:11:35.430 --> 05:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor or the drafter um my
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
understanding from reading the bill is
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
that it's it's an attempt to get a
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
broader perspective on the possible
 
05:11:43.548 --> 05:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
benefits associated with the sighting of
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
a facility right now as we discussed
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
earlier in the hearing um the uh the
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
statute really looks at kind of three
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
things does does the proposed facility
 
05:11:56.670 --> 05:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
meet some kind of uh calculated capacity
 
05:11:59.628 --> 05:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
need for waste disposal is it consistent
 
05:12:02.350 --> 05:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
with the uh provisions of the solid
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
waste management plan and is it
 
05:12:07.470 --> 05:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with the hierarchy um or does
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
it help to advance the hierarchy of
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
Waste Management preferred options this
 
05:12:14.670 --> 05:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
seeks to as I read it to include a
 
05:12:16.548 --> 05:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
broader perspective of looking at
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
possible uh harms or benefits that might
 
05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
be associated with the facility that go
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
beyond just providing capacity or being
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with the state's plan for
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
managing solid waste and goes to more
 
05:12:30.030 --> 05:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
really local and Regional Community
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
issues like um you know economic impacts
 
05:12:37.150 --> 05:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
noise um traffic Transportation
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
issues thank you representative
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I used
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
to work with planners and we would send
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
out rfps to for to get Consultants to
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
help us on projects and to you know to
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
broaden our expertise and to me this
 
05:12:55.230 --> 05:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
seems like an opportunity for Dees to to
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
talk to somebody who doesn't do exactly
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
what you do but what I wonder about is
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
how much would you
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
um how much would you prioritize like
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
the benefits over the harm or you know
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
how how would you assess you know sort
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
through the the information that you get
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's a great question that's a
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
question that we've asked ourselves in
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
reading this bill and I don't I don't
 
05:13:19.230 --> 05:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
think the bill really goes quite goes
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
there or gives any clear guidance on how
 
05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
you would it doesn't say it's a class
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis it doesn't say that it
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't say how to you know it doesn't
 
05:13:30.670 --> 05:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
provide any kind of basis for scoring
 
05:13:34.510 --> 05:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
various benefits versus V various harms
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
so it's really difficult to say what how
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
how whether it's the agency or some
 
05:13:42.750 --> 05:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
other party how that would be uh an
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
analyzed followup yep so um could you
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
make suggestions on how how to PR you
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
know sort of what information would be
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
important to you and how you would prior
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
prioritize it in order to improve the
 
05:14:00.110 --> 05:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill um well I guess you know just right
 
05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
here and now with your question I I I'm
 
05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
not prepared to tell you here's how you
 
05:14:05.590 --> 05:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
should score it and here's what wins and
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
what doesn't but certainly I I think you
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
know as as permit as a perming Authority
 
05:14:12.390 --> 05:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
the agency has had to make difficult
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
decisions in the past and there have
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
certainly have been times where um
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
issues and and and impacts Beyond uh the
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
the scope of what the agency's charged
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
with evaluating have been a concern that
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
have been expressed um by the community
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
members or or others and um I think that
 
05:14:33.670 --> 05:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's why our testimony is that we do
 
05:14:35.270 --> 05:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
think that a broader look at some of
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
these impacts is is is is indicated and
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
is important and we're willing to work
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the legislature to try to sort out
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
what that might look
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
like thank you representative
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
Penza just quickly because I'm a
 
05:14:50.548 --> 05:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill that the
 
05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
intention is for it to be uh the person
 
05:14:56.230 --> 05:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's putting in a permit to um not
 
05:14:58.350 --> 05:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
Dees to though go find the Independent
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
party it would be the responsibility of
 
05:15:02.270 --> 05:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
that but I'm sure it could be the
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee could amend that to that I
 
05:15:07.390 --> 05:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
also just my question here is there's so
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
many things that are in this paragraph
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
that talk about things that are in your
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
prw so that's right it from your
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
previous testimony it looks as if you
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
were staying that the State's
 
05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department the state's environmental
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
Department doesn't have a single person
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
in its building that's actually capable
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
of reading not not writing just reading
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
a report that discusses the harms of an
 
05:15:38.350 --> 05:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
environmental project is that true no I
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
first I'll say
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
everyone I've worked with the Department
 
05:15:42.190 --> 05:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
is an excellent reader so we're
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
certainly capable of reading um those
 
05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
things and I don't I'm glad you asked
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
the question because I don't want it to
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
sound like everything in that paragraph
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
described describes areas that we're not
 
05:15:54.670 --> 05:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
qualified to evaluate in fact many of
 
05:15:57.030 --> 05:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
the things in that paragraph are
 
05:15:59.548 --> 05:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
specifically addressed in in the
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
directives the legislature has given us
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
and in the administrative rules that
 
05:16:05.310 --> 05:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
we've uh Advanced to that we have a
 
05:16:07.948 --> 05:16:07.958 align:start position:0%
direct um responsibility to evaluate
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
those things and those things would
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
include groundwater and surface water
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
pollution um and you know air emissions
 
05:16:15.788 --> 05:16:15.798 align:start position:0%
from the facility we absolutely look at
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
those things and we're I think well
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
positioned to do that and I'm not
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that this bill should uh
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
take that away from the department and
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
give it to a different group what I'm
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting is there are areas outside of
 
05:16:30.510 --> 05:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
our areas of expertise that would
 
05:16:32.590 --> 05:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from the expertise of others
 
05:16:36.270 --> 05:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
employees okay representative H Haskins
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
director whimet so would you think then
 
05:16:49.390 --> 05:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
if we did the CBA with people who are
 
05:16:53.190 --> 05:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
organized to do cost benefit analysis
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
analyses and that we have the expertise
 
05:16:59.070 --> 05:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
of the department and the permits that
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
have to be acquired for air and water um
 
05:17:07.948 --> 05:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
that we could uh together um and I like
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Howard's RFP idea um
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
get some names and review uh those names
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
and put together the CBA with the um
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
environmental impact that your
 
05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
department is surely authorized and um
 
05:17:33.548 --> 05:17:33.558 align:start position:0%
able and ready to do that we could put
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
together something that would help us do
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
this benefit versus harm again I'm
 
05:17:41.070 --> 05:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get at the forest for the
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
trees you know some of us believe that
 
05:17:49.708 --> 05:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
we need more um data for the harms that
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
any project could befall and does that
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
sound reasonable to you it does I think
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's been my testimony today and and I
 
05:18:00.548 --> 05:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
think that I do want to clarify though
 
05:18:02.670 --> 05:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
that um depending on what circles you
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
travel in a cost benefit analysis means
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
a very particular thing and I don't
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
think that's what this bill is in
 
05:18:12.430 --> 05:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
envisioning cost benefit usually implies
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
you can think of cost in a broader sense
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
but often when you talk about a cost
 
05:18:19.548 --> 05:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis it's looking at what is
 
05:18:21.470 --> 05:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
the dollar value of what it's going to
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
cost for a particular project and then
 
05:18:26.110 --> 05:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
again weigh that against some assigned
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
dollar value to the benefits and I don't
 
05:18:30.150 --> 05:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
think that's what this bill is trying to
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
do it is an analysis of benefits and
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
potential harms and and somehow
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
Reckoning between them to figure out
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
whether a facility ought to be it or not
 
05:18:40.990 --> 05:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's actually a cost
 
05:18:43.310 --> 05:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis Madam chair followup
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
followup and would there not be cost to
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
the harms as well oh I'm not not
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you couldn't do it I'm
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
just saying that my understanding of the
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
bill is that it doesn't seek to do what
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
traditionally is called a cost benefit
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
analysis that's all it's
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
justan thank you I have a question and
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
then uh representative Scully so my
 
05:19:02.160 --> 05:19:05.430 align:start position:0%
then uh representative Scully so my
question

05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.190 --> 05:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
is in this new paragraph I mean there's
 
05:19:10.948 --> 05:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
there are many areas where your
 
05:19:13.230 --> 05:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
department is certainly qualified to
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
make a determination of harms versus
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
benefits but for the parts that they
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps are
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
not would it be uh a good idea as part
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill and as an amendment or
 
05:19:32.230 --> 05:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
whatever that you would seek someone
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
outside of the department probably an
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
independent contractor that you can do
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
an R f p on and
 
05:19:44.670 --> 05:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
then charge that work the cost of that
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
work to the
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
applicant is that something that you
 
05:19:51.310 --> 05:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
could see as a
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
workable thing I think that is a that
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's one construct that you could use
 
05:19:59.548 --> 05:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's what I've suggested
 
05:20:01.830 --> 05:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
here in my testimony what I've suggested
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
in my testimony is exploring the idea of
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
a separate decision-making body that
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
would act um first as part of a two-part
 
05:20:14.190 --> 05:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
decision-making process um but certainly
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
depending on how we're determined to to
 
05:20:19.470 --> 05:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
work best you know there are there are
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
other examples of the agency having the
 
05:20:26.910 --> 05:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
authority to um hire outside experts to
 
05:20:29.310 --> 05:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
advise it in in its permanent processes
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's certainly something I
 
05:20:33.070 --> 05:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
think when you do that do you normally
 
05:20:35.070 --> 05:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
Bill whoever it is you're working with
 
05:20:37.230 --> 05:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
to if the statute gives us the authority
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
to do that yes that's what we would okay
 
05:20:40.628 --> 05:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
good to
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
know representa Scully thank you madam
 
05:20:48.030 --> 05:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
chair now if I remember the testimony of
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor he had said there were 16 other
 
05:20:54.750 --> 05:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
states that are basically are now
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
currently employing this type of
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
approach for
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation um so I would assume there's
 
05:21:02.230 --> 05:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
16 different templates potential
 
05:21:04.590 --> 05:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
templates to review and perhaps draw
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
from to create something that we think
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
would be workable for us has your agency
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
done this in the past in terms of going
 
05:21:13.390 --> 05:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
look at how other people have done it
 
05:21:15.548 --> 05:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
and put together um using you know
 
05:21:17.590 --> 05:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
rather than Reinventing the wheel
 
05:21:19.948 --> 05:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
completely using what's been done before
 
05:21:21.190 --> 05:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
and come up with something that's best
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
for us sure there's certainly a number
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
of regulatory approaches we've taken
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
where we looked at surveyed what other
 
05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
states were doing to try to get ideas or
 
05:21:30.270 --> 05:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
to figure out what works well and what
 
05:21:32.830 --> 05:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't I think as to the first part of
 
05:21:35.310 --> 05:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
your your question and I don't want to
 
05:21:36.990 --> 05:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
speak for the sponsor but what I took
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor's testimony was he was
 
05:21:41.230 --> 05:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
I thought he was speaking about 16 other
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
states that have something like a
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Environmental a nepo policy
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
National Environmental Policy Act
 
05:21:49.270 --> 05:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statement and
 
05:21:51.628 --> 05:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
assessment process I don't I didn't
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
think he was talking specifically about
 
05:21:55.948 --> 05:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
for decisions about landfills but I I
 
05:21:58.548 --> 05:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to testify for him
 
05:22:02.750 --> 05:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
so representative guber uh yes uh first
 
05:22:04.590 --> 05:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
clarification I think he was referring
 
05:22:07.390 --> 05:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
to the NEPA process in the other states
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
but not the same uh my my question is um
 
05:22:12.750 --> 05:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
does dees currently have legal is
 
05:22:15.270 --> 05:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
legally permitted to consider all harms
 
05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
and adverse uh impacts during your
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
permitting process are you limited to
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
certain things and this would allow you
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
to look at other things that are not
 
05:22:22.000 --> 05:22:22.990 align:start position:0%
to look at other things that are not
currently

05:22:22.990 --> 05:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
permitted I I I I do think that the
 
05:22:27.990 --> 05:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
statute gives us pretty clear Direction
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
on what areas we're to be evaluating in
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
what and and and leaves out areas other
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
areas and so this I think would it's a
 
05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
little unclear the way draft but it it
 
05:22:41.628 --> 05:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
implies at least that the agency would
 
05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
be able to consider
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
additional potential harms outside the
 
05:22:47.628 --> 05:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
scope of what we currently have
 
05:22:50.230 --> 05:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
Authority for yes this quick and what
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
sort of areas were they uh what sort of
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
areas would you that add to your
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
permitting process that you you can
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
consider if this was well I guess if you
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question if you
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
read the bill to say that the um the
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
independent third party analysis that's
 
05:23:11.590 --> 05:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
described red in lines 12 through 20 um
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
which includes um noise odor traffic um
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh emissions and transport uh
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
impacts related to um transportation to
 
05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
the facility um those would be I think
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
areas that we have we have some limited
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
ability we we we regulate noise and odor
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
the the current rules say that noise and
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
odor has to be limited to the extent
 
05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
practicable but it doesn't really give
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
us us um specific authority to evaluate
 
05:23:44.670 --> 05:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
noise or odor impacts in the context of
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
a permit decision whether that's yay or
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
nay um and then um you know I I think
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
that actually and then traffic would be
 
05:23:55.150 --> 05:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
another one we we we do have authority
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
to evaluate traffic impacts very
 
05:23:59.948 --> 05:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
localized to the facility but it's not
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not clear that we really
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
have authority to look at traffic
 
05:24:06.190 --> 05:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
impacts that are further of healed from
 
05:24:09.070 --> 05:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
the facility thank you very much okay
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:24:16.030 --> 05:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
very much for rearranging your schedule
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
again to come back and testify and that
 
05:24:21.270 --> 05:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
goes for everybody else who's come back
 
05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%

again there we go uh good afternoon
 
05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I do have two hard copies
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
there and I did just email the committee
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
during our break so you have all that
 
05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
digitally uh my name is Amy manzelli and
 
05:25:14.430 --> 05:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the North Country
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balance change to testify
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
in support of HB
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
215 um I did just want to go over some
 
05:25:24.670 --> 05:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
of the technicalities here I have
 
05:25:27.868 --> 05:25:27.878 align:start position:0%
reviewed and analyzed the as introduced
 
05:25:31.230 --> 05:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the proposed amendment um
 
05:25:34.270 --> 05:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of you know the language
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
getting word smithed some of the
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
concepts getting tinkered with and
 
05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
improved um but we are not in favor of
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would result in a
 
05:25:46.430 --> 05:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
study committee so I just kind of wanted
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
to set that
 
05:25:52.110 --> 05:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
forward um as I was thinking about sort
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
of uh the RSA 49m which of course is the
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
statute that this bill Tinkers with you
 
05:26:02.430 --> 05:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
know it daunted on me that big statutes
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
like this they're like all of our homes
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know the to-do list is never done I
 
05:26:10.590 --> 05:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
look back over um the legislative
 
05:26:12.430 --> 05:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
history and I found I want to get the
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
number right here uh you all have
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
amended this Statute in seven of the
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
past eight years so you're tinkering
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're tinkering you're tinkering you're
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
making it better but just like that
 
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
to-do list at home it's never done it's
 
05:26:28.868 --> 05:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
never going to be perfect um and so HB
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
215 it's just another opportunity to
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
make RSA 149 M even better and I want to
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
go over some of the points point about
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
how it does that uh obviously you've
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
heard um just now and then earlier today
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
the Crux of that is this net public
 
05:26:52.590 --> 05:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
benefit changing uh the language so it's
 
05:26:55.390 --> 05:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
a net public benefit not just public
 
05:26:57.868 --> 05:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
benefit we're not just going to stack up
 
05:26:59.788 --> 05:26:59.798 align:start position:0%
the benefits and see if they're enough
 
05:27:01.470 --> 05:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to stack up the harms and
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a balancing test um so
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
the first thing that this statute this
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
if this bill were enacted the statute
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
would do is it would make what is a very
 
05:27:14.400 --> 05:27:16.270 align:start position:0%
would do is it would make what is a very
sensible

05:27:16.270 --> 05:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
sensible
 
05:27:19.628 --> 05:27:19.638 align:start position:0%
clarification that it's only the
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
facility applied for that can make
 
05:27:28.110 --> 05:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
enough benefits to be permitted so if
 
05:27:30.990 --> 05:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's a solid waste facility
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
expansion then it's that expansion that
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be analyzed it's not the
 
05:27:37.280 --> 05:27:38.750 align:start position:0%
needs to be analyzed it's not the
applicants

05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
other facility at a different part of
 
05:27:46.548 --> 05:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
the state that can generate the
 
05:27:50.590 --> 05:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
benefits that would justify an expansion
 
05:27:53.590 --> 05:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
at the facility being applied for so
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's one of the changes we're talking
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
when we're adding up the benefits and
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
the harms and we're looking at the net
 
05:28:03.310 --> 05:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
public benefit we're only thinking about
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
the harms and the benefits of the
 
05:28:07.868 --> 05:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
facility being applied for so that's
 
05:28:11.548 --> 05:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
number number one um number two and this
 
05:28:13.390 --> 05:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
came up with um director whims Hat's
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I wanted to make sure that the
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee is aware this the approach
 
05:28:23.470 --> 05:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill uses is based on well
 
05:28:26.150 --> 05:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
settled New Hampshire law and the two
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
examples that I've given you here are uh
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
with zoning boards of adjustment when
 
05:28:32.190 --> 05:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
they consider a
 
05:28:34.830 --> 05:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
variance one of the variance criteria
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
which is set in state law and I have the
 
05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
citation there for you it's you know 674
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
33 Roman 1 12C um is that substantial
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
justice has to be done this is a
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
balancing test that
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
means any loss to the applicant that is
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
not outweighed by a gain to the general
 
05:29:00.788 --> 05:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
public so you're balancing the harms and
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
the benefits of a project in the context
 
05:29:06.030 --> 05:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
of a variance if you're sitting as the
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
zoning board
 
05:29:12.910 --> 05:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
and just like as proposed in this bill
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
the zoning board has the authority to
 
05:29:20.708 --> 05:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
hire its own Consultants to assess the
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
harms and benefits of the project now I
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
know we there was discussion earlier
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill envisions the applicant
 
05:29:30.548 --> 05:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
doing the hiring of the independent
 
05:29:32.830 --> 05:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
third party it's a little bit of a
 
05:29:34.990 --> 05:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference in my
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
view because I've seen this unfold
 
05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
hundreds of times it's a collaborative
 
05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
approach the applicant and whatever the
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
decision-making body is be it a zoning
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
board planning board site evaluation
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee what have you they work
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
together to identify the consultant to
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
identify the scope of work the scope of
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
work is going to say what the consultant
 
05:29:58.750 --> 05:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
is going to do when they're going to do
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
it how much it's going to cost all of
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
that is pre-agreed upon because the
 
05:30:07.470 --> 05:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
applicant does not want to pay for it
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
only to find out that the decision maker
 
05:30:12.190 --> 05:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
wanted a little bit something different
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
so they work together collaboratively to
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
get the study done and then the
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
application is
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
processed the other thing I wanted to
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
highlight here is RSA 162 H this is the
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
sighting statute for energy generation
 
05:30:29.590 --> 05:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
in transmission facilities the site
 
05:30:31.708 --> 05:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee sort of like a
 
05:30:34.470 --> 05:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide zoning board for power plants
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
and transmission lines same thing they
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
have the power to um hire their own
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
experts and they routinely do so this
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
sort of concept it works really well now
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to mention the site
 
05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee citing laws because
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
of another aspect there that is similar
 
05:30:58.470 --> 05:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
to what is proposed
 
05:31:02.430 --> 05:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
here that law recognizes you don't even
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
have to debate about it it just
 
05:31:07.470 --> 05:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes that energy transmission and
 
05:31:12.030 --> 05:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
energy generation projects have adverse
 
05:31:14.830 --> 05:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
effects they just do okay we're just
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
going to everybody comes to the table
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
with that acknowledgement we're not even
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to try to pretend that they don't
 
05:31:25.510 --> 05:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
the key in that statute is if the
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
project has
 
05:31:30.750 --> 05:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable adverse effects you're not
 
05:31:32.510 --> 05:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to get a certificate of
 
05:31:35.590 --> 05:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
site if the applicant can show that you
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't this the lawyer double negative if
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have unreasonable adverse
 
05:31:43.470 --> 05:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
effects then you get your certificate of
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
sight and that's what hp215 seeks to do
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
let's just acknowledge an expanded or a
 
05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
new solid waste facil facility is going
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
to have adverse effects so let's balance
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
it up and make sure the ones that are
 
05:32:00.390 --> 05:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
cited are the ones that have a net
 
05:32:02.670 --> 05:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
public benefit just like some of our
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
other well settled New Hampshire
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
law and then lastly I just wanted to
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
talk about the Capac need um I think
 
05:32:12.270 --> 05:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
this was brought up earlier this is a
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
direct response from the invitation from
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court in a
 
05:32:17.160 --> 05:32:18.190 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court in a
December

05:32:18.190 --> 05:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
December
 
05:32:21.470 --> 05:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
2023 uh decision where the New Hampshire
 
05:32:25.150 --> 05:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said you know uh we have
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
one party here who says capacity need
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
means you know you have to the landfill
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
the solid waste applicant has to show
 
05:32:36.030 --> 05:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
that the landfill is needed every second
 
05:32:37.548 --> 05:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
of every day of every year for its
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
entire ire operational Lifetime and the
 
05:32:43.948 --> 05:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
other side said uh no you know we we
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
just have to show like it's needed for
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
one day um HB 215 rejects these polar
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
opposite positions and takes a middleof
 
05:32:59.788 --> 05:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
the road Common Sense approach and it
 
05:33:03.628 --> 05:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
says the applicant just us to show that
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
you are filling a need for solid waste
 
05:33:08.270 --> 05:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
disposal half the time that you're going
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:33:11.708 --> 05:33:11.718 align:start position:0%
operating so it considered these two
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
polar opposite positions that were
 
05:33:17.708 --> 05:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
involved in that lawsuit and it chose
 
05:33:19.390 --> 05:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
you know right down the middle of the
 
05:33:19.400 --> 05:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
you know right down the middle of the
road

05:33:20.830 --> 05:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
road
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
approach that's what I have for the
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
committee today um it's all documented
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the letter that I submitted in your
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
record I would welcome questions thank
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much um I really
 
05:33:33.708 --> 05:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate you laying out a lot of these
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
points for US Representative Bixby yes
 
05:33:38.350 --> 05:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Chair for My taking my
 
05:33:43.390 --> 05:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you um Miss maneli
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
Mani okay um that should be a little bit
 
05:33:52.110 --> 05:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
better um so uh thinking about I I like
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
your explanation of the way that um we
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
already have a model for getting uh EXT
 
05:34:00.670 --> 05:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
outside consultants in New Hampshire law
 
05:34:03.310 --> 05:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you think that the
 
05:34:06.390 --> 05:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced needs to clarify that
 
05:34:07.708 --> 05:34:07.718 align:start position:0%
portion of how it works a little a
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:34:11.868 --> 05:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
better as I read the bill I do see that
 
05:34:14.190 --> 05:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
it is ambiguous as to who would be doing
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
that whether the applicant or the agency
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
um but I did hear and I I keyed into the
 
05:34:24.910 --> 05:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor's explanation that the intention
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
was to not constrain the agency um and
 
05:34:31.830 --> 05:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
when you learn administrative law in law
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
school they give you this analogy that
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
administrative law is like a paint by
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and you all the lawmakers you
 
05:34:42.310 --> 05:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
pick the colors and you make the shapes
 
05:34:44.030 --> 05:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
and you fill in the numbers of where the
 
05:34:45.948 --> 05:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
colors are supposed to go but the
 
05:34:48.190 --> 05:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
agencies actually paint the painting
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
they have to paint within the boundaries
 
05:34:51.470 --> 05:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
and they have to use the colors that you
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
set forth um but they get to do the
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
painting and so I took that to mean that
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
it was the sponsor's intention that the
 
05:35:01.868 --> 05:35:01.878 align:start position:0%
agency would fill in those details with
 
05:35:04.230 --> 05:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
the ru
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
making thank you representative King
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony today um I hope my
 
05:35:13.230 --> 05:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
question is appropriate but I've got
 
05:35:14.990 --> 05:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
your written testimony here and I'm just
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
curious because in the letter head it
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
says BCM environmental and land law pllc
 
05:35:22.510 --> 05:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
but then you're representing North
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
Country Alliance for balance change can
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
you just explain why like what what what
 
05:35:29.708 --> 05:35:29.718 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the two of
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
those are and also just a little bit
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
about what North Country Alliance for
 
05:35:35.470 --> 05:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
balance change is all about I hope that
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
question is appropriate
 
05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
I'll allow it if it's brief than sure um
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
I am the attorney for North Country
 
05:35:46.230 --> 05:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balance change uh BCM
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
environmental and land law is my Law
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
Firm that's where I'm employed uh and
 
05:35:54.430 --> 05:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
ncbc is my longtime client um uh I'm
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to punt on the what NC ABC is
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
about because we have one of their um
 
05:36:01.628 --> 05:36:01.638 align:start position:0%
folks here who can do a better
 
05:36:03.628 --> 05:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
explanation on that than I can but
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
generally they are a nonprofit
 
05:36:09.470 --> 05:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
organization advocating for a balance in
 
05:36:12.390 --> 05:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
our development and uh preserving the
 
05:36:12.400 --> 05:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
our development and uh preserving the
North

05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
North
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
Country thank you for that
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
chair um sort of that was a great
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you so much so much
 
05:36:26.948 --> 05:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
clarification for me um as about halfway
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
through you said you know what if you
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria for
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
for benefits like if the benefits
 
05:36:35.708 --> 05:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
outweigh the harm then you get the
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
permit I mean is that is it an automatic
 
05:36:41.070 --> 05:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
is it or or do you just get to advance
 
05:36:44.910 --> 05:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
to making your application um that I was
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
referencing I believe the unreasonable
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
adverse effects which is the language
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
used in RSA 162 which governs the
 
05:36:55.150 --> 05:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
sighting of energy transmission
 
05:36:56.910 --> 05:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
facilities and generation or
 
05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
transmission and generation facilities
 
05:37:02.430 --> 05:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
um I was simplifying it is not a simple
 
05:37:04.190 --> 05:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
process just like the process for
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
obtaining a solid waste permit currently
 
05:37:09.190 --> 05:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated at process and
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
there's a um rather short set of
 
05:37:16.070 --> 05:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
statutory standards and then there's an
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
elaborate set of rules that support
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
those and so there's a lot of boxes um
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
to be checked off and I don't mean to
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
use a check off the Box analogy to say
 
05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not qualitative because it's
 
05:37:31.350 --> 05:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
quite qualitative there are lots of
 
05:37:33.868 --> 05:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
reports lots of analysis that go into
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
the approval
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
but yes if you can demonstrably satisfy
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
no unreasonable effect then your project
 
05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:37:47.230 --> 05:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
permitted followup
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
yet could you say that phrase again that
 
05:37:55.868 --> 05:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
like no no what sure no
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
unreasonable adverse
 
05:38:02.830 --> 05:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
effect thank you yep and in the statute
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
that that contains all that is
 
05:38:05.948 --> 05:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
referenced in my letter if you want to
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
look it up
 
05:38:07.840 --> 05:38:08.948 align:start position:0%
look it up
represent

05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
Penza I would love you to thank you
 
05:38:12.910 --> 05:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair I would love you to speak
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
briefly um on what you just said because
 
05:38:18.510 --> 05:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's so important um from
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that we've had to
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
make this clear that when a when someone
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
is putting in their permit
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
application there these things aren't
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
looked at in the sense of uh for any
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
sort of public benefit net public
 
05:38:36.390 --> 05:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
benefit let's say air pollution for one
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
all they're doing is checking off a box
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
saying that we're following federal law
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
correct can you can you speak to that
 
05:38:45.070 --> 05:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
how it's not we're not looking at we're
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
just it's it's not an analysis of all
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
these other entities it's just basically
 
05:38:51.670 --> 05:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
saying okay yeah we're going to follow
 
05:38:55.230 --> 05:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
federal law yep um yes thank you for the
 
05:38:57.390 --> 05:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
question it it is a little bit tricky
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
you know um because for example there is
 
05:39:02.990 --> 05:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
an air Resources Division at the New
 
05:39:04.270 --> 05:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
05:39:07.548 --> 05:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm sure that this bill is
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
not saying duplicate the exact same work
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the air Resources Division is doing
 
05:39:17.310 --> 05:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
again um I think what this Bill is
 
05:39:19.390 --> 05:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
saying and I think director whim hat um
 
05:39:21.628 --> 05:39:21.638 align:start position:0%
did a good job explaining this the
 
05:39:26.190 --> 05:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
current law really lays out um three
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
areas which you could think about as
 
05:39:27.840 --> 05:39:28.910 align:start position:0%
areas which you could think about as
three

05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
constraints does the solid waste
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
facility meet a capacity need you know
 
05:39:36.190 --> 05:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
is is there are we all generating trash
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
which we all do and there's no more hole
 
05:39:41.070 --> 05:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
to put it in and it can't be recycled it
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
can't be composted Etc it needs to be
 
05:39:45.990 --> 05:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
landfilled so is there a capacity need
 
05:39:48.230 --> 05:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
um as you all know especially this
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
committee there is a solid waste
 
05:39:52.350 --> 05:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
management plan so does this project
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
satisfy whatever that says at the
 
05:39:57.150 --> 05:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
current time and there's the solid waste
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
hierarchy which I mentioned in my
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
letter um Source reduction Recycling and
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
reuse composting waste to energy
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
incineration without resource recovery
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
and then last call landfilling so does
 
05:40:11.590 --> 05:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
this project satisfy that
 
05:40:15.070 --> 05:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
hierarchy the department is constrained
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know from considering things outside
 
05:40:22.270 --> 05:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
of that so um you know a rather
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
humorous example is like well what about
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
the seagulls you know what about the the
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
noise and the nuisance and the excrement
 
05:40:33.520 --> 05:40:34.910 align:start position:0%
noise and the nuisance and the excrement
of

05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:40:38.230 --> 05:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
seagull like that's a real
 
05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
impact is that something that the
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
department can
 
05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
consider you know um and director whim
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
touched on a couple others you know
 
05:40:52.708 --> 05:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
traffic um the Department of
 
05:40:54.990 --> 05:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation is probably going to be
 
05:40:57.788 --> 05:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
implicated in any project expansion or
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
new project because there's likely going
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
to need a need to be a new or amended
 
05:41:06.270 --> 05:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
driveway permit but the Department of
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
Transportation is likely not going to be
 
05:41:12.910 --> 05:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
considering uh noise or emissions
 
05:41:15.628 --> 05:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
especially Statewide or the leate
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
hauling aspects of what's going to be in
 
05:41:21.548 --> 05:41:21.558 align:start position:0%
the trucks so there's a lot that is
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
worthy of consideration that the
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
department is not under current law
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
arguably empowered to
 
05:41:30.680 --> 05:41:32.590 align:start position:0%
arguably empowered to
consider

05:41:32.590 --> 05:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:41:35.150 --> 05:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
05:41:38.030 --> 05:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions no thank thank you so very
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony today thank you
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
all we really appreciate your work on
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
this and I'd like to call Henry veu from
 
05:41:44.878 --> 05:41:49.390 align:start position:0%
this and I'd like to call Henry veu from
Waste

05:41:49.390 --> 05:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.468 --> 05:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
Management then we have two more thank
 
05:41:54.430 --> 05:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh and members of the
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:41:58.868 --> 05:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
Henry veu and I'm here on behalf of
 
05:41:58.878 --> 05:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
Henry veu and I'm here on behalf of
Waste

05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
05:42:02.670 --> 05:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
Management um which owns and operates
 
05:42:05.548 --> 05:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
the turkey landfill in
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
Rochester um we took uh members of the
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
committee out there last spring uh not
 
05:42:14.070 --> 05:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
everyone was able to attend and I know
 
05:42:16.270 --> 05:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
there are new members on this committee
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
um we'd be happy to uh do another tour
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
this spring uh I think it's uh
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
informative um but I'm just here to
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
speak about uh the impact of this bill
 
05:42:34.548 --> 05:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
on an existing landfill like uh the tury
 
05:42:38.910 --> 05:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
landfill in Rochester um it's a
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
1455 Acre Site um Waste Management has
 
05:42:45.910 --> 05:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
been operating it since
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
1983 so they've been operating it there
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years um it has permitted
 
05:42:58.270 --> 05:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
capacity uh that will take us to
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
2034 or more um the permit
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
requires uh it to be open until June of
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
2034 for but the way they've been
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
managing uh and depleting uh its
 
05:43:15.548 --> 05:43:15.558 align:start position:0%
capacity it will likely uh last a little
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
longer uh than
 
05:43:23.548 --> 05:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
2034 um it has undeveloped land at that
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
site that could uh they could
 
05:43:30.190 --> 05:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
expand uh which would bring its life
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
into the following decade um if they
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to expand they would have to go
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
through uh the process of getting a
 
05:43:42.270 --> 05:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
permit and going through this public
 
05:43:45.910 --> 05:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
benefit um process uh they've gone
 
05:43:50.030 --> 05:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
through it six times in the 40 years uh
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
and able they have been able to
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a public benefit there has
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
been a need for uh the capacity uh and I
 
05:44:03.628 --> 05:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
think representative Jana uh uh director
 
05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
whims out and um attorney miselle
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
explained what's involved in the current
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
public benefit demonstration um the
 
05:44:12.510 --> 05:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
department the statute directs the
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
department to look at a 20-year
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
Horizon and determine whether over that
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
next 20 years we have enough capacity to
 
05:44:26.948 --> 05:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
put New Hampshire generated trash into
 
05:44:29.708 --> 05:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh the facility um it also requires them
 
05:44:33.070 --> 05:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
to look in uh context of the
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
hierarchy um land filling is down the
 
05:44:40.190 --> 05:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
bottom uh you know it's reuse uh uh
 
05:44:42.750 --> 05:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other uh ways to
 
05:44:45.270 --> 05:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
manage it uh and it also has to compare
 
05:44:47.910 --> 05:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
it to the solar Waste Management plan so
 
05:44:52.468 --> 05:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
right now um if uh the tury
 
05:44:55.468 --> 05:44:55.478 align:start position:0%
landfill wants to
 
05:44:58.510 --> 05:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
expand and extend the life of that
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
facility which they currently can do
 
05:45:04.868 --> 05:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
Beyond 2034 35 uh they would have to go
 
05:45:07.948 --> 05:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
through this process and so
 
05:45:13.708 --> 05:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
bill um would apply in that instance um
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
and looking at the new language uh in
 
05:45:20.590 --> 05:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
bold on lines 12 through 20 of the bill
 
05:45:24.110 --> 05:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh Waste Management would have to uh pay
 
05:45:26.270 --> 05:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
for um an
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
assessment uh to be
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
conducted uh to
 
05:45:32.788 --> 05:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
determine the potentially harmful
 
05:45:36.390 --> 05:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
impacts on human health property values
 
05:45:36.400 --> 05:45:37.590 align:start position:0%
impacts on human health property values
tourism

05:45:37.590 --> 05:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and Wildlife and it
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
further states that such impacts may be
 
05:45:47.990 --> 05:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh noise odor traffic groundwater
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
pollution surface water pollution
 
05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas and emissions from
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
transport of solid waste uh and what I'm
 
05:46:00.270 --> 05:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
trying to say today is that all these
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
conditions currently exist and they've
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
existed at that site for 40 years and so
 
05:46:08.948 --> 05:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
just question in the utility and the
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
value of doing this assessment on an
 
05:46:13.200 --> 05:46:14.590 align:start position:0%
value of doing this assessment on an
existing

05:46:14.590 --> 05:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
existing
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
facility um the noise will probably be
 
05:46:20.708 --> 05:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
the same the odor will probably be the
 
05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
same the traffic transporting the waste
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
will be the same and so um I just
 
05:46:32.030 --> 05:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
question whether there's any value and
 
05:46:36.670 --> 05:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
utility and imposing this on a facility
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's been around for 40 years and
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
is looking to expand um and that's
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
basically uh my testimony for
 
05:46:50.270 --> 05:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
today thank you um yeah representative
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
so would you say now I guess I'll ask my
 
05:47:03.030 --> 05:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
first question which would be you said
 
05:47:03.040 --> 05:47:05.830 align:start position:0%
first question which would be you said
that

05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:09.548 --> 05:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
the you have been able to D demonstrate
 
05:47:11.230 --> 05:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
benefit over the course of the last 40
 
05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
years my first question would be is that
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
analysis available to the public where
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
that had been done can the public look
 
05:47:23.548 --> 05:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
at what those assessment looks like from
 
05:47:26.548 --> 05:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
Dees and maybe from the town uh where
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
your facility is that'd be my first
 
05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah so RSA 149 M11 the public
 
05:47:37.070 --> 05:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
benefit requirement um it lists in here
 
05:47:40.190 --> 05:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh What uh it directs the department to
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
do to figure out whether there is that
 
05:47:45.628 --> 05:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
public benefit um I'm assuming that all
 
05:47:48.350 --> 05:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
of that is all public record uh and
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
available um through the through the
 
05:47:55.628 --> 05:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
state yes I'm sorry followup y thank you
 
05:47:59.468 --> 05:47:59.478 align:start position:0%
madam chair the followup I would have is
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we heard testimony
 
05:48:03.430 --> 05:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
that the statute has changed seven times
 
05:48:06.110 --> 05:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
in eight years and I imagine it's
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
changed a DEC amount over the course of
 
05:48:10.830 --> 05:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years don't you think it
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
would behoove a facility or I guess
 
05:48:16.750 --> 05:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
rather don't you think that uh it would
 
05:48:18.830 --> 05:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
be necessary for a facility if it was
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
going to go through an expansion given
 
05:48:24.150 --> 05:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
the fact how much rules change over 40
 
05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
years to have to go through an analysis
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
like that I'm not saying we shouldn't
 
05:48:30.670 --> 05:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through the public benefit
 
05:48:36.070 --> 05:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
analysis what I'm saying is that the new
 
05:48:37.390 --> 05:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh condition
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and uh things that assessment the
 
05:48:43.390 --> 05:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
assessment that is being called for in
 
05:48:43.400 --> 05:48:44.190 align:start position:0%
assessment that is being called for in
this

05:48:44.190 --> 05:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh doesn't really seem to uh apply
 
05:48:52.350 --> 05:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
to an existing facility where all those
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
conditions currently exist that's all
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
one more followup the final followup I
 
05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
would have is I guess maybe we could
 
05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
flush this out on in the email exchange
 
05:49:04.030 --> 05:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that but I I I guess I
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see how any of those
 
05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
conditions outlined in the bill wouldn't
 
05:49:12.030 --> 05:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
apply to a facility that is currently
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
existing pollution air noise all those
 
05:49:18.510 --> 05:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
things things like uh property values
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
those properties are already next to the
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
facility okay um it they know it could
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
expand so I'm sure real those impacts
 
05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
are already they already exist we don't
 
05:49:34.190 --> 05:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
have to have someone make an assumption
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
that if you bring this thing in it's
 
05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to drop property values or
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
whatever because those properties the
 
05:49:45.390 --> 05:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
impact is already there okay uh and and
 
05:49:48.590 --> 05:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
the traffic the trucks going in to the
 
05:49:51.628 --> 05:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
facility they'll probably be the same
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the number of older complaints you can
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
look over 40-year history and get a
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
sense of what they are and um we're
 
05:50:03.548 --> 05:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
going to do a heck of a lot better job
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
at at addressing those but uh I think
 
05:50:11.070 --> 05:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill is calling for
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
um are already known in an existing
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
facility okay and and maybe that part of
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know the benefit this net public
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
benefit um doesn't really need to be
 
05:50:24.400 --> 05:50:25.590 align:start position:0%
benefit um doesn't really need to be
conducted

05:50:25.590 --> 05:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
05:50:27.708 --> 05:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
on because I think largely the
 
05:50:29.948 --> 05:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
Consultants will say what's existed for
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
40 years are probably going to continue
 
05:50:33.628 --> 05:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
to exist over the next 10 years this
 
05:50:36.310 --> 05:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
facility is there and is there a lot of
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
value when doing that okay um
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Penza and then
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative H
 
05:50:45.948 --> 05:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
Haskins uh thank you madam chair um and
 
05:50:49.868 --> 05:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
05:50:52.110 --> 05:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you and I'm of course uh
 
05:50:54.910 --> 05:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative in Rochester um so I'm
 
05:50:58.110 --> 05:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
very familiar with uh the uh the
 
05:51:02.468 --> 05:51:02.478 align:start position:0%
landfill uh TurnKey so um so basically
 
05:51:04.750 --> 05:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
we're saying that the we already know
 
05:51:07.590 --> 05:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
what the impacts are and we know what
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
they've been over 40 years so I agree
 
05:51:12.788 --> 05:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
with you I don't think this is necess
 
05:51:15.750 --> 05:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is necessary for for that but just
 
05:51:19.150 --> 05:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
based upon like your experience um in
 
05:51:22.750 --> 05:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
the field for let's say a brand new
 
05:51:25.948 --> 05:51:25.958 align:start position:0%
landfill that's going in um do you feel
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
like these the criteria that's in here
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
um is can be identified it's is clear so
 
05:51:38.468 --> 05:51:38.478 align:start position:0%
um you're you're asking about a facility
 
05:51:40.628 --> 05:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh where none exists a proposal for
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
facility none exist uh a
 
05:51:47.948 --> 05:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
hypothetical um and uh I would say that
 
05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
um certainly you could measure that
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
stuff I think you could hire Consultants
 
05:51:54.788 --> 05:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
to tell you how much traffic will
 
05:51:58.110 --> 05:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
probably best estimated to go there um
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
maybe the impact on uh uh uh the homes
 
05:52:03.708 --> 05:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
around there and whatnot
 
05:52:06.270 --> 05:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
um that uh is something that doesn't
 
05:52:08.708 --> 05:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
exist ex right now so there might be
 
05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
some utility in that um certainly more
 
05:52:16.150 --> 05:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
utility than doing it for a site where
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
we already know what those are but you
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
certainly can hire
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh the communities could
 
05:52:25.070 --> 05:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
hire Consultants to come up
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
with uh their best guess yeah follow up
 
05:52:33.070 --> 05:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
follow up in regards with TurnKey and
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
let's say um you get to that
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
2034 2035 asking for uh 2 or three year
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
um extension or an expansion um it's
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for you because you're just
 
05:52:49.750 --> 05:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
saying that these impacts are measurable
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
we have a 40-year history um those
 
05:52:53.948 --> 05:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
impacts probably really wouldn't
 
05:52:55.708 --> 05:52:55.718 align:start position:0%
increase much like let's say for
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
Rochester so all of the other things
 
05:53:00.910 --> 05:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
that you already do as a company with
 
05:53:02.548 --> 05:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
notifications and all that would already
 
05:53:04.910 --> 05:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
be in place and all of these people
 
05:53:09.230 --> 05:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:12.430 --> 05:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative H Haskins thank you
 
05:53:15.310 --> 05:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair so I'm trying to understand
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
the nature of expansion if if a landfill
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
is expanded and you say the impacts are
 
05:53:26.430 --> 05:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
already known we have more trucks we
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
have more odor we have more traffic
 
05:53:31.708 --> 05:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expanding the
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
footprint the phrase that comes to my
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
mind is when you know better you do
 
05:53:40.390 --> 05:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
better so now we know a lot more about
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
that than we did 20 years ago so
 
05:53:49.830 --> 05:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the same benefit apply to an
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
expansion given that we now can assess
 
05:53:54.520 --> 05:53:56.190 align:start position:0%
expansion given that we now can assess
new

05:53:56.190 --> 05:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:53:59.590 --> 05:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
technology helps us to assess some of
 
05:53:59.600 --> 05:54:00.510 align:start position:0%
technology helps us to assess some of
those

05:54:00.510 --> 05:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
factors so um because they have a
 
05:54:06.628 --> 05:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
40-year history there um and they've
 
05:54:08.948 --> 05:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
gone through six
 
05:54:11.910 --> 05:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
expansions um we know the number of
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
trucks that are going in there uh we
 
05:54:16.750 --> 05:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
have to log uh and and have known all
 
05:54:20.830 --> 05:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:24.510 --> 05:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
um again I think the there'll be very
 
05:54:27.510 --> 05:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
little change because we'll be closing
 
05:54:30.310 --> 05:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
down a portion of the
 
05:54:33.708 --> 05:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
landfill that we won't be able to fill
 
05:54:37.350 --> 05:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
anymore and just
 
05:54:39.548 --> 05:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
when they go to apply for a permit they
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
didn't apply for the permit for all,
 
05:54:46.788 --> 05:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
1455 Acres they do it in bite sizes and
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
so the expansion that would occur and
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
the use of that would probably be about
 
05:54:56.190 --> 05:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
equal to what the previous small bite
 
05:55:00.190 --> 05:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
size was and so in that regard there
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
won't be a lot of difference that that's
 
05:55:04.510 --> 05:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say I see thank you
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative K than thank you madam
 
05:55:08.868 --> 05:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
shair and uh thank you for taking my
 
05:55:10.750 --> 05:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
question but first off I'd like to say
 
05:55:13.310 --> 05:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the field trip last
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
spring for anyone that has not gone on
 
05:55:20.670 --> 05:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
it it was eye openening I was absolutely
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
amazed so I just wanted to thank and
 
05:55:25.708 --> 05:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for inviting us back um I do
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
have a question for you and I do
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
understand after going on that field
 
05:55:30.670 --> 05:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
trip what you're talking about with odor
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
and things like that you're closing up
 
05:55:35.708 --> 05:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
one and adding another section as the
 
05:55:35.718 --> 05:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
one and adding another section as the
expansion

05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
05:55:40.350 --> 05:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
my question to you is you stated that
 
05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
current capacity right now is to 2034 is
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct we are the
 
05:55:49.628 --> 05:55:49.638 align:start position:0%
permit requires us to keep it open until
 
05:55:52.510 --> 05:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
2034 so you know there's a lot of talk
 
05:55:54.468 --> 05:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
about outstate trash we turn away a lot
 
05:55:56.390 --> 05:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
of out ofate trash because we have to
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee for the State of New Hampshire
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
a place to put that trash until 2034 so
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have to monitor how much trash goes
 
05:56:06.788 --> 05:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
in there okay
 
05:56:06.798 --> 05:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
in there okay
um

05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
and if you need to once you are getting
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
close to how long does it take for a
 
05:56:20.590 --> 05:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
process to happen to expand further what
 
05:56:22.468 --> 05:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
is that process so they will have to
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
begin soon I mean 2034 sounds like a
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
while down the road but they are going
 
05:56:32.150 --> 05:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
to have to begin soon uh getting ready
 
05:56:34.708 --> 05:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
to submit because
 
05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise if they don't the permit yet
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the other and the section is full
 
05:56:41.830 --> 05:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a period of time
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
where there will be a heck of a lot less
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
capacity in the state and so it's uh
 
05:56:51.628 --> 05:56:51.638 align:start position:0%
soon one more I I I
 
05:56:54.510 --> 05:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
guess what is the time frame is it is it
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
a three-year time frame is it a
 
05:56:57.868 --> 05:56:57.878 align:start position:0%
four-year time frame let me get that
 
05:57:00.510 --> 05:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
exactly from Steve pudy he he that's
 
05:57:03.190 --> 05:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
what he does thank and I'll uh send an
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
email to the committee thank you so much
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
05:57:15.548 --> 05:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
um uh you you you have not directly said
 
05:57:18.190 --> 05:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
this but I'm wondering whether uh what
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
you would prefer or what what your or
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
the organization you represent would
 
05:57:25.150 --> 05:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
prefer would be to Simply have a waiver
 
05:57:27.868 --> 05:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
for existing uh as expansions of
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
existing landfills or whether it be be
 
05:57:33.150 --> 05:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
some sort of modification where all of
 
05:57:36.310 --> 05:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
the current data that is known uh such
 
05:57:38.590 --> 05:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
as the traffic rates the Odor Control
 
05:57:43.628 --> 05:57:43.638 align:start position:0%
Etc would be uh filed as like a a
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
baseline uh I think we'd prefer just to
 
05:57:48.830 --> 05:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
be Exempted out that that existing
 
05:57:52.750 --> 05:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
facilities the utility of this
 
05:57:56.548 --> 05:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
information uh you know the exercise of
 
05:57:58.430 --> 05:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
going through this not the we already
 
05:58:00.350 --> 05:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
have the information is what I'm saying
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
and so um uh hiring Consultants to do it
 
05:58:04.798 --> 05:58:08.468 align:start position:0%
and so um uh hiring Consultants to do it
um

05:58:08.468 --> 05:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
so is that is that information that you
 
05:58:15.910 --> 05:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
um that you already submit to Dees as as
 
05:58:18.190 --> 05:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh for documentation along the way and
 
05:58:21.430 --> 05:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
you're like so do you submit to them
 
05:58:23.070 --> 05:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
reports on traffic and on odor
 
05:58:26.350 --> 05:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
complaints Etc no okay thank you
 
05:58:26.360 --> 05:58:28.190 align:start position:0%
complaints Etc no okay thank you
represent

05:58:28.190 --> 05:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:58:30.548 --> 05:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair um just
 
05:58:32.070 --> 05:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm in Rochester I'd like to
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
answer and ask a question as well um I
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
have to say that we management does a
 
05:58:38.788 --> 05:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
fantastic job of communicating with the
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
constituents even constituents that are
 
05:58:43.390 --> 05:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
very angry whether it be about odors and
 
05:58:45.948 --> 05:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
all of that um would you be amenable if
 
05:58:49.190 --> 05:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
there is in a sense like a carve out for
 
05:58:52.510 --> 05:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
an extension to be able to provide you
 
05:58:54.628 --> 05:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
know the information that we you know on
 
05:58:56.510 --> 05:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
record not saying you have to go hire a
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
$50,000 consultant because like I said
 
05:59:00.868 --> 05:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
everybody kind of knows especially in
 
05:59:03.750 --> 05:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester what's going on but I think
 
05:59:06.150 --> 05:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
that people like to see that what you
 
05:59:08.110 --> 05:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
just said people don't realize like
 
05:59:10.270 --> 05:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
they're thinking a big huge footprint
 
05:59:12.590 --> 05:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
not just it's expanding so the one
 
05:59:14.350 --> 05:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
closes and all of that kind of stuff
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to still have that
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
information come out to the public all
 
05:59:21.230 --> 05:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
of the surrounding areas that are
 
05:59:23.468 --> 05:59:23.478 align:start position:0%
affected by the landfill yeah I mean we
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
know the trucks the number of trucks
 
05:59:27.510 --> 05:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming in and out uh there's no
 
05:59:29.310 --> 05:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
secret about that we can you know share
 
05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
that information um I think the
 
05:59:35.788 --> 05:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
department I suspect they record when
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
people people uh complain about odors
 
05:59:40.030 --> 05:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
and so I think there's probably a log of
 
05:59:44.350 --> 05:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
that uh so that's known um other
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
information about there you know the the
 
05:59:47.868 --> 05:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
the real estate
 
05:59:51.788 --> 05:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
values those are known so I mean to your
 
05:59:51.798 --> 05:59:53.590 align:start position:0%
values those are known so I mean to your
question

05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:59:56.310 --> 05:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we need to hire someone
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do an assessment to get all that
 
06:00:01.110 --> 06:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.990 --> 06:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
available representative wheeler thank
 
06:00:06.670 --> 06:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
06:00:08.390 --> 06:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
so if you don't need to hire somebody to
 
06:00:10.030 --> 06:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
do it is that information already
 
06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
available to the public are you as
 
06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative gerana or Bixby said are
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
you already providing that information
 
06:00:20.468 --> 06:00:20.478 align:start position:0%
to D Dees so how could we access that
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
information I uh to your answer your
 
06:00:24.430 --> 06:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
question if someone wanted to get it
 
06:00:25.628 --> 06:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
they'd probably have to invest a little
 
06:00:27.390 --> 06:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
time and go look for it I mean because
 
06:00:29.510 --> 06:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's not probably in packaged in one
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
nice neat little place um but the
 
06:00:36.670 --> 06:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
information is available um and
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so okay representative H Haskins
 
06:00:42.270 --> 06:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I'm still stuck
 
06:00:45.628 --> 06:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
on this expansion thing so would a
 
06:00:49.150 --> 06:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
potential expansion be the exact
 
06:00:52.390 --> 06:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
footprint of a part of the landfill that
 
06:00:54.110 --> 06:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
you had already closed down you mean the
 
06:00:56.910 --> 06:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
number of acres and whatnot uh obvious
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
they vary a little bit um I would think
 
06:01:03.830 --> 06:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but we would know I mean the the
 
06:01:06.750 --> 06:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
department will want to
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
just as they have with the expansions to
 
06:01:10.638 --> 06:01:12.548 align:start position:0%
just as they have with the expansions to
date

06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
date
 
06:01:15.150 --> 06:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
um get some sort of
 
06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
guarantee uh because right now the
 
06:01:21.510 --> 06:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
primary public benefit measurement is do
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
we need the capacity and so they're
 
06:01:26.948 --> 06:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
going to want to hold you to keep to to
 
06:01:28.350 --> 06:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining that
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
capacity uh and so like with every
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
permit to date there will likely be we
 
06:01:37.390 --> 06:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
want that room and capacity there until
 
06:01:39.750 --> 06:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
X date and then you could do
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
calculations about the number of uh you
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
know dumps that could be uh deposits of
 
06:01:50.110 --> 06:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
trash um this information could be
 
06:01:50.120 --> 06:01:52.310 align:start position:0%
trash um this information could be
gathered

06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
gathered
 
06:01:57.670 --> 06:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
um followup Madam followup y um so we're
 
06:02:00.350 --> 06:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get in this
 
06:02:03.628 --> 06:02:03.638 align:start position:0%
bill what
 
06:02:08.190 --> 06:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
um Miz Manel called The Balancing Act
 
06:02:12.510 --> 06:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
Right Between benefits and harms so I'm
 
06:02:16.590 --> 06:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
not yet clear that an analysis shouldn't
 
06:02:20.548 --> 06:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
be done for an expansion given it's on
 
06:02:23.390 --> 06:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
the other side of the, 1400 Acres there
 
06:02:26.548 --> 06:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
are other people living off that end in
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
that direction um I think it would be
 
06:02:33.750 --> 06:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
useful for an expansion and and I
 
06:02:35.430 --> 06:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say that the
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
community communities could hire
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
Consultants but of course we don't think
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
the communities should bear the burden
 
06:02:45.868 --> 06:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
of the cost is that
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
clear uh I was just referring to the
 
06:02:51.948 --> 06:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
bill so it says that
 
06:02:54.788 --> 06:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
um there's an assessment shall be
 
06:02:57.628 --> 06:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
conducted on behalf of the host
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
community and other abing municipalities
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
right on behalf of the communities not
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
by the communities right they they and
 
06:03:08.510 --> 06:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
as was described it probably be the
 
06:03:13.350 --> 06:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
department with the Pere the applicant
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh is going to bear the cost yeah the
 
06:03:18.990 --> 06:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
applicant would bear the cost um exactly
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
and U uh a consultant would be found
 
06:03:24.590 --> 06:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
sure thank
 
06:03:28.910 --> 06:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee one more okay
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
um so just uh just a
 
06:03:42.030 --> 06:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
basic question so um do you believe that
 
06:03:45.468 --> 06:03:45.478 align:start position:0%
in in the next 20 years that the
 
06:03:48.750 --> 06:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
landfill would be would provide right
 
06:03:50.708 --> 06:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
right now based upon the criteria that
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know would be more of a public
 
06:03:56.350 --> 06:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
benefit than a harm in with TurnKey
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes simple question simple answer thank
 
06:04:02.628 --> 06:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you so
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.110 --> 06:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay um well it's good afternoon now my
 
06:04:47.548 --> 06:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
paperwork said good
 
06:04:49.708 --> 06:04:49.718 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for it's morning

somewhere yes there you go I'll try to
 
06:04:54.350 --> 06:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
keep this as brief as possible you've
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
heard a lot already and it's late um did
 
06:05:00.030 --> 06:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
I hear earlier that someone did ask who
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
NC ABC
 
06:05:07.430 --> 06:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
is okay um I a member of
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
ncbc I'm not a board
 
06:05:12.510 --> 06:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
member uh the president and the vice
 
06:05:14.830 --> 06:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
president are usually here for these
 
06:05:16.510 --> 06:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
meetings but both of them could not be
 
06:05:16.520 --> 06:05:17.230 align:start position:0%
meetings but both of them could not be
here

06:05:17.230 --> 06:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:05:22.510 --> 06:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
today um but briefly ncbc stands for
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
North Country Alliance for balance
 
06:05:30.628 --> 06:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
change and it is a volunteer Grassroots
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
organization I brought this up
 
06:05:37.230 --> 06:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
here it was founded in 20 2008 in the
 
06:05:38.830 --> 06:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
belief that a healthy economy in
 
06:05:40.350 --> 06:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire depends on a
 
06:05:40.360 --> 06:05:41.788 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire depends on a
healthy

06:05:41.788 --> 06:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
environment and they have three main
 
06:05:47.150 --> 06:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
goals they're working toward stopping a
 
06:05:49.510 --> 06:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
massive landfill from fing the North
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
country that would be sitting near
 
06:05:54.310 --> 06:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
pristine Forest Lake and in the middle
 
06:05:57.468 --> 06:05:57.478 align:start position:0%
of the amonk river Watershed one of New
 
06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's highest rated Wildlife
 
06:06:04.468 --> 06:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
areas uh ncbc advocates for Clean Water
 
06:06:07.190 --> 06:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
and Air climate protection and public
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
health as well as Solid Waste Management
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
reform and they advocate for um
 
06:06:15.788 --> 06:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
education for New Hampshire residences
 
06:06:19.070 --> 06:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
and visitors that's brief um you can go
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
to their website of course if you want
 
06:06:22.830 --> 06:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
to learn more and I can try to answer
 
06:06:25.430 --> 06:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
any questions you'd have but that's a
 
06:06:25.440 --> 06:06:26.990 align:start position:0%
any questions you'd have but that's a
brief

06:06:26.990 --> 06:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
brief
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
summary is that
 
06:06:29.040 --> 06:06:30.910 align:start position:0%
summary is that
good

06:06:30.910 --> 06:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:06:35.230 --> 06:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
okay um so again good afternoon Madam
 
06:06:37.628 --> 06:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
chair woman Aaron and honorable members
 
06:06:40.510 --> 06:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee the house environment
 
06:06:42.990 --> 06:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
and agriculture committee for the record
 
06:06:45.548 --> 06:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
my name is Nancy Morrison and I have
 
06:06:48.430 --> 06:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
residences in both Whitefield and Mont
 
06:06:50.830 --> 06:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
Vernon New Hampshire I would like to
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
First express my gratitude to this
 
06:06:56.270 --> 06:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee for your continued willingness
 
06:06:58.270 --> 06:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
to engage and work to improve how New
 
06:07:01.150 --> 06:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manages Solid Waste through
 
06:07:01.160 --> 06:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manages Solid Waste through
your

06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:07:04.670 --> 06:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
diligence awareness and progress has
 
06:07:06.590 --> 06:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
been accomplished but as you can see
 
06:07:09.430 --> 06:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
from House Bill 2115 there is more to be
 
06:07:12.030 --> 06:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
done I'm here today to ask your support
 
06:07:13.430 --> 06:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
for this important
 
06:07:16.270 --> 06:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
bill recently I attended Jael car
 
06:07:18.910 --> 06:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
committee meetings regarding updated
 
06:07:18.920 --> 06:07:20.190 align:start position:0%
committee meetings regarding updated
landfill

06:07:20.190 --> 06:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
06:07:22.830 --> 06:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
rules they concluded that the way to
 
06:07:25.990 --> 06:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
create effective Solid Waste reform is
 
06:07:29.070 --> 06:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
through legislative policy that is
 
06:07:32.590 --> 06:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what HB 2115 would do in one
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
addressing the principle of net public
 
06:07:37.030 --> 06:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
benefit two two further defining
 
06:07:41.190 --> 06:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
capacity need and the timing to bring it
 
06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
online and three clarifying that a
 
06:07:45.948 --> 06:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
landfill permit must be evaluated on its
 
06:07:48.948 --> 06:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
own merits separate from other
 
06:07:51.548 --> 06:07:51.558 align:start position:0%
projects considering the concept of net
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
public benefit why wouldn't we look at
 
06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
both the benefits and harms of a
 
06:07:58.190 --> 06:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
landfill permit isn't it common sense to
 
06:08:01.230 --> 06:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
weigh both the pluses and the minuses of
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
such an impactful project we all know
 
06:08:06.708 --> 06:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
that landfill can have significant
 
06:08:09.310 --> 06:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental repercussions for a region
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
the environment public health and for
 
06:08:15.708 --> 06:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
communities it seems to me that making a
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
permanent decision is not just about
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
Capacity Analysis and meeting technical
 
06:08:25.468 --> 06:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
regulations I support House Bill 215
 
06:08:29.230 --> 06:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
because it includes a holistic set of
 
06:08:31.510 --> 06:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
considerations and in the absence of
 
06:08:35.070 --> 06:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
clearly articulated legislative policy
 
06:08:38.190 --> 06:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
which we we are depending on you for
 
06:08:40.590 --> 06:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
decisions are left to the discretion of
 
06:08:43.990 --> 06:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
a single agency
 
06:08:47.430 --> 06:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
Dees I do ask could the benefits versus
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
harms analysis that HB 2115
 
06:08:53.708 --> 06:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
provides have made a difference in the
 
06:08:57.430 --> 06:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
permitting process of St gobain in marac
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
which has been has had a devastating
 
06:09:03.310 --> 06:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
impact on that
 
06:09:05.670 --> 06:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
Community would such an analysis have
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
changed the results of any of the
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
state's 22 super fund
 
06:09:12.270 --> 06:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
sites we will never know
 
06:09:16.270 --> 06:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
that uh just to consider capacity why
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
would we ever permit additional capacity
 
06:09:21.910 --> 06:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
if that capacity doesn't fill a demand
 
06:09:24.468 --> 06:09:24.478 align:start position:0%
shortfall for more than half its
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
life and regarding a new landfill why
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
would we ever bring that additional
 
06:09:33.548 --> 06:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
capacity online before it is
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
needed if Our intention is to achieve
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
de's Solid Waste Management plan with
 
06:09:42.990 --> 06:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
the overarching goal of significantly
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of solid waste
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
needing disposal in the state which was
 
06:09:52.910 --> 06:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
a reduction of 25% by 2030 and
 
06:09:55.708 --> 06:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
45% by
 
06:09:58.788 --> 06:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
2050 then shouldn't we be measured and
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
prudent and how we bring on any
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
incremental capacity to paraphrase a
 
06:10:06.030 --> 06:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
well-known state
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
if we build it the trash will come and
 
06:10:12.670 --> 06:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
much of it may come from out of
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
state finally a landfill needs to be
 
06:10:17.910 --> 06:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated on its own merits and
 
06:10:20.350 --> 06:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be bundled with a carrot such
 
06:10:22.628 --> 06:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
as a recycling
 
06:10:25.590 --> 06:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
center House Bill 215 makes that
 
06:10:25.600 --> 06:10:27.310 align:start position:0%
center House Bill 215 makes that
legislative

06:10:27.310 --> 06:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
06:10:30.628 --> 06:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
policy crystal
 
06:10:34.030 --> 06:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
clear and I would just like to add by
 
06:10:36.990 --> 06:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
the way
 
06:10:39.270 --> 06:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to address the fact that
 
06:10:42.948 --> 06:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
testimony you no doubt receive um from
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:52.270 --> 06:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
bill um in my
 
06:10:55.350 --> 06:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
opinion unduly influences New
 
06:11:00.430 --> 06:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:02.708 --> 06:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
decades with what I perceive as
 
06:11:05.910 --> 06:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering and speculation
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
I believe they do not have our best
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
interest at heart and I believe it is
 
06:11:13.708 --> 06:11:13.718 align:start position:0%
time for the legislator to call this
 
06:11:16.990 --> 06:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
out for what it is and Implement
 
06:11:17.000 --> 06:11:18.910 align:start position:0%
out for what it is and Implement
protective

06:11:18.910 --> 06:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
protective
 
06:11:21.468 --> 06:11:21.478 align:start position:0%
measures that New Hampshire citizens and
 
06:11:25.030 --> 06:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
their environment need based on good
 
06:11:28.110 --> 06:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
regulation not industry
 
06:11:30.350 --> 06:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
speculation and I would like to ask
 
06:11:33.628 --> 06:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
director whimet to try to make more to
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
think more outside of the box
 
06:11:38.190 --> 06:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
of what is possible for net benefit
 
06:11:40.990 --> 06:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
permitting for landfills we cannot keep
 
06:11:44.468 --> 06:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
throwing up our hands in the air and
 
06:11:47.948 --> 06:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
despair so thank you so much for giving
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
me this opportunity to speak to you and
 
06:11:53.390 --> 06:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your service to New
 
06:11:58.510 --> 06:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:00.868 --> 06:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
questions no okay thank you so much
 
06:12:03.070 --> 06:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
after all that appreciate
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
it go ahead all
 
06:12:09.150 --> 06:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
right I would love to thank you madam
 
06:12:10.468 --> 06:12:10.478 align:start position:0%
chair I would love to know and thank you
 
06:12:13.030 --> 06:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um I would love to
 
06:12:16.868 --> 06:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
know if you are familiar with um
 
06:12:19.070 --> 06:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
applications that are coming in with
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
other pieces of an app you know with
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
other pieces of making sweetening the
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
pot in a sense that's changing the
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
landscape and um and how that is should
 
06:12:32.110 --> 06:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
never be involved in a in a you know in
 
06:12:34.750 --> 06:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
this net public benefit you mean formula
 
06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
you mean like the carrot thing correct
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
um I guess I the only one I am familiar
 
06:12:43.948 --> 06:12:43.958 align:start position:0%
with is I believe cassella had offered
 
06:12:48.868 --> 06:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
to um build a murf a materials recycling
 
06:12:51.868 --> 06:12:51.878 align:start position:0%
center in uh Southern New
 
06:12:54.910 --> 06:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um as a
 
06:12:58.590 --> 06:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
carrot um that would help them to get
 
06:13:01.590 --> 06:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
their landfill built in the North
 
06:13:04.510 --> 06:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
Country um so that's a type that's
 
06:13:09.070 --> 06:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
something spefic specific that I refer
 
06:13:12.070 --> 06:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
to does that make sense yes thank you
 
06:13:15.070 --> 06:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative K yes thank you madam
 
06:13:16.590 --> 06:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to follow up on that
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
question so is it my understanding that
 
06:13:22.030 --> 06:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
they won't build the recycling plant in
 
06:13:24.270 --> 06:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire unless they get
 
06:13:25.910 --> 06:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
permitted is that what you're saying
 
06:13:28.510 --> 06:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding um as a matter
 
06:13:32.030 --> 06:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
of fact we were hoping that if the um
 
06:13:35.110 --> 06:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
landfill permits were denied for the new
 
06:13:36.670 --> 06:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
landfill in Northern New Hampshire and
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
Dalton maybe they would still build it
 
06:13:42.270 --> 06:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
because they have had a center in
 
06:13:44.910 --> 06:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem for over 30 years and maybe
 
06:13:47.390 --> 06:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
the states earned it by by now but as
 
06:13:50.110 --> 06:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
far as I understand um representative
 
06:13:53.548 --> 06:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
it's tied to if they implemented a new
 
06:13:56.190 --> 06:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
landfill in Dalton New Hampshire
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
speculation so followup thank you madam
 
06:14:02.030 --> 06:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
chair so do you know this for a fact or
 
06:14:05.230 --> 06:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
is this just speculation no no this is
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
what I've read in paperwork and
 
06:14:09.910 --> 06:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
newspapers and all that for last couple
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
years as um cassella has hoped to build
 
06:14:16.468 --> 06:14:16.478 align:start position:0%
a new facility in Dalton New Hampshire
 
06:14:18.868 --> 06:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
this has been part of what they hoped
 
06:14:21.750 --> 06:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
could go along with it and I think what
 
06:14:24.990 --> 06:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
this Bill is saying is that any new
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
landfill and the permitting of one
 
06:14:29.310 --> 06:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
really needs to be able to stand on
 
06:14:31.270 --> 06:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
itself by
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
itself follow sure one more followup y
 
06:14:36.868 --> 06:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you I I
 
06:14:40.230 --> 06:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
guess you read it in a newspaper well
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm part of ncbc I've been studying
 
06:14:46.830 --> 06:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
right years but I guess my my my thing
 
06:14:49.270 --> 06:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
is is from my own understanding I want
 
06:14:52.430 --> 06:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:52.440 --> 06:14:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

06:14:56.910 --> 06:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
without they won't build the recycling
 
06:15:02.350 --> 06:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
plant is that correct I'm sorry say that
 
06:15:03.548 --> 06:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
again please they will not build a
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
recycling plant
 
06:15:07.708 --> 06:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
that's a known fact if they don't get
 
06:15:11.310 --> 06:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
permitted is that is that is my
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
understanding and that could change and
 
06:15:15.868 --> 06:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
maybe it has changed since I understood
 
06:15:19.628 --> 06:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
that but that was my understanding okay
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
06:15:25.230 --> 06:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
H Haskins thank you madam chair is it
 
06:15:27.110 --> 06:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
not our understanding that it's part of
 
06:15:31.468 --> 06:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
the application for the permit you mean
 
06:15:35.310 --> 06:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
that it it's made mention of in the
 
06:15:37.628 --> 06:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
application I believe I I believe so
 
06:15:39.910 --> 06:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you again
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
I I always want to be sure of what I say
 
06:15:46.070 --> 06:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
I know um but I believe you are
 
06:15:49.350 --> 06:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
right any other questions thank you very
 
06:15:51.070 --> 06:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
much for coming this afternoon and
 
06:15:53.510 --> 06:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
hanging in with us thank you so much uh
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
our last person I know um natch gra is
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
not here so I'm not going to call him
 
06:16:03.190 --> 06:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
Michael Wright is our last pink card
 
06:16:06.390 --> 06:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other pink cards
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
you are the
 
06:16:12.548 --> 06:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
last of the day thank you that that's
 
06:16:14.190 --> 06:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
good for everybody since I was going to
 
06:16:16.230 --> 06:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
say good morning as well too and it's
 
06:16:20.110 --> 06:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um so I I just wanted to
 
06:16:22.468 --> 06:16:22.478 align:start position:0%
mention before I start with my testimony
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
that um the tying between the recycle
 
06:16:28.590 --> 06:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
center and the landfill is actually in
 
06:16:30.750 --> 06:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
cela's application so it that that's
 
06:16:33.670 --> 06:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
where it's located okay yeah uh so
 
06:16:36.430 --> 06:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
anyhow my name is Michael right uh I'm a
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
North Country resident and I'm from
 
06:16:42.070 --> 06:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
Littleton and I'm very pleased to be
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
here today to express my strong support
 
06:16:46.430 --> 06:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
for the house bill uh 2115 which is a
 
06:16:48.788 --> 06:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
common sense bill it just modernizes and
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
it up levels our land landfill permit
 
06:16:55.310 --> 06:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
process and it requires applicants to uh
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
submit a comprehensive report outlining
 
06:17:00.468 --> 06:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
their proposed projects potentials harms
 
06:17:03.070 --> 06:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
and benefits which just makes
 
06:17:06.310 --> 06:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
sense um I would imagine that uh you
 
06:17:07.910 --> 06:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to wake up every day to
 
06:17:10.628 --> 06:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
the smell of rotting stench of um
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
decomposing waste that's what happens
 
06:17:13.868 --> 06:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people around these
 
06:17:15.230 --> 06:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
landfills and they have to get up and
 
06:17:17.708 --> 06:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
they worry about their water and perhaps
 
06:17:19.990 --> 06:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
worry about the traffic and if they're
 
06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
if it's a tourist location like Northern
 
06:17:22.830 --> 06:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they're going to worry
 
06:17:25.190 --> 06:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
about what type of of impression this
 
06:17:27.590 --> 06:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
leaves on tourism so this is really
 
06:17:29.708 --> 06:17:29.718 align:start position:0%
important that we actually you know take
 
06:17:31.830 --> 06:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
a measured approach to considering the
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
harm that potentially might be incurred
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
by citing a landfill or in that case
 
06:17:39.030 --> 06:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
even with you know depending upon the
 
06:17:41.788 --> 06:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
specifics uh an extension of an ex of an
 
06:17:44.468 --> 06:17:44.478 align:start position:0%
existing landfill that's out there I
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
think there's been some testimony that's
 
06:17:47.708 --> 06:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
been submitted that I'd like that that
 
06:17:49.670 --> 06:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
warrant some careful consideration
 
06:17:50.510 --> 06:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
because I think there are some
 
06:17:53.948 --> 06:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
weaknesses mischaracterization in this
 
06:17:58.030 --> 06:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
and um there is testimony that suggests
 
06:18:02.070 --> 06:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
that HP HB 215 duplicates existing
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
processes and adds unnecessary cost
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
I believe this is a
 
06:18:09.750 --> 06:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation currently Dees
 
06:18:11.948 --> 06:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
practices primarily focus on evaluating
 
06:18:14.270 --> 06:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
the economic benefits such as job
 
06:18:17.708 --> 06:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
creation and landfill capacity without
 
06:18:19.468 --> 06:18:19.478 align:start position:0%
explicitly requiring a detailed
 
06:18:21.110 --> 06:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
assessment of the potential harms like
 
06:18:23.590 --> 06:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination noise and air
 
06:18:27.390 --> 06:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
pollution so HP 215 addresses this Gap
 
06:18:30.310 --> 06:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
by ensuring there's a balance evaluation
 
06:18:32.510 --> 06:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
of both benefits and harms this is not
 
06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
redundancy it is a necessary enhan ment
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire residents in
 
06:18:36.798 --> 06:18:38.030 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire residents in
their

06:18:38.030 --> 06:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:18:41.110 --> 06:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
environment uh opponents argue that HB
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh 215 introduced subjectivity into the
 
06:18:47.548 --> 06:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
permitting process in reality what HB
 
06:18:50.628 --> 06:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
215 calls for harm assessments to be
 
06:18:53.350 --> 06:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
conducted by independent and qualified
 
06:18:55.510 --> 06:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
third parties ensuring
 
06:18:57.868 --> 06:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
objectivity moreover adding a structured
 
06:19:00.350 --> 06:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
appraisal of harms does not inherently
 
06:19:03.230 --> 06:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
delay the process but ensures that
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
decisions are based upon a comprehensive
 
06:19:06.390 --> 06:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
and fair
 
06:19:09.030 --> 06:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
evaluations this approach prevents Rush
 
06:19:10.830 --> 06:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that could lead to long-term
 
06:19:13.468 --> 06:19:13.478 align:start position:0%
environmental and public health cost
 
06:19:16.590 --> 06:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
everybody in new New Hampshire knows the
 
06:19:18.230 --> 06:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
impact of this when we think of like the
 
06:19:20.590 --> 06:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
St gobain
 
06:19:23.030 --> 06:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
situation opponents will claim that HB
 
06:19:25.910 --> 06:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
215 will increase costs for applicants
 
06:19:27.868 --> 06:19:27.878 align:start position:0%
and harm lowincome
 
06:19:29.910 --> 06:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
families however the cost of harm
 
06:19:32.628 --> 06:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
assessment is modest it's very modest uh
 
06:19:35.310 --> 06:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
to the total cost of landfill permitting
 
06:19:35.320 --> 06:19:36.350 align:start position:0%
to the total cost of landfill permitting
and

06:19:36.350 --> 06:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:38.750 --> 06:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
construction most importantly failing to
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
evaluate harms can result in a far
 
06:19:43.310 --> 06:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
greater cost to communities in the form
 
06:19:46.110 --> 06:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
of health issues property value declines
 
06:19:49.510 --> 06:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the environmental degr uh degradation
 
06:19:52.708 --> 06:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
costs that typically and disunat uh
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
affect low-income
 
06:19:56.468 --> 06:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
families opponents assert that the
 
06:19:59.030 --> 06:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
current DS regulations are sufficient to
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
protect the health and property and the
 
06:20:02.708 --> 06:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
environment well this bill wouldn't be
 
06:20:04.510 --> 06:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
in front of you if that were the case
 
06:20:06.670 --> 06:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
and there's ample evidence around the
 
06:20:08.230 --> 06:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
country we can take a look at some of
 
06:20:10.310 --> 06:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
the landfills that are somewhat locally
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
here too where people have had to
 
06:20:14.310 --> 06:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
actually sell their house because they
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
just couldn't take the odor any longer
 
06:20:18.548 --> 06:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
and I I just can't imagine being in that
 
06:20:19.990 --> 06:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
type of
 
06:20:22.190 --> 06:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
position um opponents claim that the
 
06:20:25.190 --> 06:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill creates an anti-pr bias by
 
06:20:27.230 --> 06:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
requiring harm assessments while this is
 
06:20:30.548 --> 06:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
completely unfounded HB 2115 simply

environmental and Community impacts I
 
06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
would uh ask the committee to that we
 
06:21:05.910 --> 06:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't let the pursuit of perfection or
 
06:21:08.270 --> 06:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
the status quo getting way which could
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
be really important progress for our
 
06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
