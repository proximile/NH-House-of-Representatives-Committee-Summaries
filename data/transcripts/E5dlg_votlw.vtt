is not current law the part that's not
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
current law that's in his estimate so we
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
understand each other what our estimates
 
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 align:start position:0%

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
he'll go over what's
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
the estimates are the affected by house
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
bill to so Chris do you want to go
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
through the documents that you provided
 
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
the committee here represent major so
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
last night um I sent out an email to the
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to that with
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
that email there was four
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
documents excuse me three documents um a
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
PDF and an Excel of a comparison
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
document a PDF and an Excel of the
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
worksheet and then the Lang House Bill 2
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
language that Matt provided me to share
 
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
with the committee about the
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
applicability dates for the various um
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
tax law changes and if I can I'd like to
 
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
share my screen so I can kind of walk
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
you through the comparison sheet as that
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
is and why it's different that would be
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
great uh if Jen or Brad could let me
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
so you should see an Excel page um
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
across the top it says house Ways and
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
Means and governor general fund
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund estimates excuse
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
me so as you go across you're going to
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
see the FY 2021 plan and then you'll see
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates for 21 22 23
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
and then you have the house Ways and
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
Means and I've populated what you've
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
discussed so far obviously that's
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
subject to change and then what the
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
differences are between what the
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
governor and the house um estimates will
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
be what you
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
see up on the governor's estimates on
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
the top half of that table so it's be
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
Row 4 through 20 that is current
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
law those estimates are based on current
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
law in fiscal year
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
21 the um
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
numbers are adjusted for the anomalous
 
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
Revenue that was collected in fiscal
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
year 21 that's going to go back to
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 so for instance if I
 
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
hover over the business taxes for fiscal
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
year 21 you'll see that the original
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
estimate was
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
8.25.18 point2 that goes back to fiscal
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
year um
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
2020 those numbers those those anomalous
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
numbers are in a table at the bottom of
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
chart and so those are all adjusted up
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
above and then on lines 24 through
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
31 those are um Revenue
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
adjustments related to changes that the
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
governor's um suggesting in his house
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill too in house bill one and that's
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
what Matt will talk you through um you
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
know all the estimates for the governor
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
changes and then from here all these
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
Governor's numbers I just to the
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
worksheet if you if you're you recall I
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
had given you a worksheet um earlier
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
this week but I hadn't been able to
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
adjust the numbers yet because I didn't
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
um have the
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
detail so that now these numbers are
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted so if you go and look in the
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
worksheet you should find that these
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
three columns are now where the
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
governor's information
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
is um and then we did the same thing for
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
fund and for fishing game so there's
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
sheet and then
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll just stop share here and I'll
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
just pull up the worksheet so you can
 
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:39.450 align:start position:0%
just see where I was talking
 
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:52.750 align:start position:0%
just see where I was talking
[Music]

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
about so again on the
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
worksheet row 10 should now be all
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
adjusted with what you just saw in that
 
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.430 align:start position:0%
adjusted with what you just saw in that
comparison

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
document row 17 would again be adjusted
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
with um any changes that
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
um removing you know the the uh the new
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's associated with changes
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
in in the budget so these numbers should
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
tie to the charts that you saw in that
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
comparison sheet that I showed
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
you so that's that's all those sheets
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
are it's a lot of information I gave you
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
an Excel file I gave you a PDF file um
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
um some people like to print them the
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
PDFs sometimes are a little bit easier
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
than the excels and some people like to
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually mark up the documents online so
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's why you have the
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
Excel um any any questions from the
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
point representative Brony yeah thank
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
you Chris um it would also be helpful if
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
you on a separate document just just
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
show us you want to speak up I'm sorry
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh Chris it would be helpful to see what
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
the actual uh revenues would were us
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
having to go through the math uh what
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
the actual reductions were or what the
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
governor thinks the reductions will be
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
through these new tax law changes the
 
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.710 align:start position:0%
through these new tax law changes the
whole

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
numbers but I can go back to to my work
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
worksheet from last week and to this one
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and compare and start doing the math you
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
know what I mean so so are you asking
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
by it's only a handful of areas right
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
that have changed correct yep so let me
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
again so on this p on this sheet
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
here right you that sheet you've backed
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
out uh you youve you've equalized to
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
current law correct that's correct so
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
but on the bottom here that that's the
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
adjustments that are made oh they're
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
down the bottom there I'm sorry right so
 
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
for the meals and rooms for instance you
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
see it's a $19 million reduction in 22
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
and 23 I got it you've already done it
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
no you're good thank
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
you you're good thank you and again U
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
Matt will you know we'll talk you
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
through all of this and and um address
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have um and and
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
again he's invited here today to talk
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
revenues yeah and I can um you know as
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
as Matt gets going if he would like me
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
to screen share or if he wants to screen
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
share um the document that he needs that
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine as
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
well um but I think repent M has a
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
question but other than that I I think
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
we're almost ready for Matt and before
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
we go to represent yly when you look at
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
fy22 for the governor for the business
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
Governor's uh interpretation of current
 
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.230 align:start position:0%
Governor's uh interpretation of current
law

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes and then you go down below the
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
uh the the business taxes will be um
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted by the Dr Auditors the BET
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
change for the threshold from to 250 the
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
rate change and then for the offsetting
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
BPT Revenue increase so four those four
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
lines would be netted against um the 824
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
to come up or we Ned against the 824 to
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
come up with that you go back up to the
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
FY 2022 8
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
24.9 our Revenue estimate under current
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
law may be
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
different than what the governor is this
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
is where our starting point is yep Y and
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
and some of these on the bottom here um
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
we won't fill it in until Ways and Means
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and finance have looked at House Bill 2
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
and decided whether they're keeping some
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
of these changes and then we'll update
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
this document as we go through the
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
process so you can see that um for
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
instance if if finance and Ways and
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
Means and the legisl uh the house um
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
votes to pass the budget and and there's
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
certain things of these that are still
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
in there you'd see it carried over if
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's other adjustments for instance
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with the auditor
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
position and the amount of Revenue that
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
they would bring in we would show an
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
adjustment over here and if there's a
 
00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
new tax or a new fee change that you
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
want to include whether it be up or down
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
we would add lines and you'd see that so
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
this would be a document that throughout
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
the process we would try to update um so
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
that the committee could look at that at
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
any point and know what's going
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
on okay represent y you had a
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
question not so much question other than
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
state that what Chris is presenting here
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
is more of a technical thing in in the
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh regarding where things are and how
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
they were set up uh that was all I do
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
however for
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
who for the Governor's um presentation
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
um regarding inflation so we'll get the
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
a head start on that one thank
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
you okay and you're going to hold it
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
right all right any further questions on
 
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.230 align:start position:0%
right all right any further questions on
the

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
process saying
 
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.110 align:start position:0%
process saying
none

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
explain your Revenue estimates
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh it's great
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
to be before you I'll be it virtually
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure this will be the first of
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
of many unique parts of this uh budget
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
process this year in light of Co um but
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to recognize that
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
you know this work is important as we
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
all know and it'll be challenging as we
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
all know but there certainly is a path
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm excited to kick that off
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
formally this morning uh discuss the
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
governor's Revenue
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
estimates I'm sure you all saw the
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
governor's budget presentation last week
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure many of you have also seen
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
the governor's remarks to house finance
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh and this budget is balanced
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
without any form of speculative Federal
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
money uh and we're excited to put
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
forward these Revenue estimates because
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
it does point to a strong economic
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
recovery not only in the business sector
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
but also in the hospitality sector
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I think the revenue estimates are
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
indicative of that you know we're we're
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
very confident that as the vaccine
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
contines to roll out um and we continue
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
to see people feel more comfortable to
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
go back out uh and participate in the
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
economy in the ways they did in the
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
before times uh New Hampshire is very
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
well positioned uh for a strong bium
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm sure many of you will have
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
questions on the tax cuts uh I'm more
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
than happy to discuss those and the
 
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.710 align:start position:0%
than happy to discuss those and the
revenue

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh impacts associated with those uh I
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
would say that we've worked very closely
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Revenue
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
Administration in compiling these
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
estimates and one thing that you'll see
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
is that all of our estimates do fall
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
within the ranges that Dr has provided
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh both from a current law standpoint
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
and even also once you net out those tax
 
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.909 align:start position:0%
and even also once you net out those tax
change

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
impacts um some of you may have
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions on macroeconomic indicators uh
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
C certainly happy to discuss some of
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
those potential action that we might see
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
out out of Washington DC which these
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates do not reflect but
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
that is something that the committee
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
will need to consider um should
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
additional stimulus or investment in the
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
economy come from Washington that may
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
have a material impact on where State
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
revenues go but again that is not
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
included uh in anything that you have
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
before you today um from there I'll talk
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit about tax cuts I may have
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
some files to share that might be
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee um but most of
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
all happy to take your questions and and
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
clear anything up that I might be able
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
to I believe a draft version of House
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
Bill two has been circulated to the
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee um obviously once that is
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
finalized I'm happy to have H further
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
conversations um but that should be a
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
good guide post for where we are
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
today we haven't seen that draft version
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
yet Matthew
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
okay um I don't know Chris if that's
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
something that um you might be able to
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
share with the committee I believe house
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
finance has seen it at this point and I
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
apologize if it hasn't made its way um
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
to Ways and Means just
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
yet so Matt we I shared the document
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
that you provided related to the
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
applicability but the full draft of
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill two that the governor
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
transmitted to um the finance committee
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then over to ol
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
um that version was released by the
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
chair of Finance to finance members and
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't have permission to go beyond
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
that at this
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
point that makes sense so right now it's
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
in drafting um with OSS um they're
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
they're working as quickly as they can
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
to get a a bill
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
drafted the the committee still needs to
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
um susp to allow for the introduction of
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
the bills I is my understanding as well
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
so once that's done and the drafting is
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
completed it will be released but in the
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
meantime I think they'll have to rely on
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
some of the information that you're
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
going to share Matt as well as um maybe
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
if they get something from represent wer
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
or other members of Finance but at this
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
point we didn't have permission to share
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
it be on the committee the finance
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Chris and I
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that context um what the
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee should have are the relevant
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
tax Provisions that I was able to send
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
along those are um the the bulk of
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
everything that would be relevant to
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue conversation so that should give
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
us enough to go on for today
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
um before you go on uh there is a
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
question from represent
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah thank you um yeah Matt you
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh sorry to call you Matt I
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
probably should call you uh no worries
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
representative either is fine okay um
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned when you started maybe
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
this was referring refering to the Hill
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
2 document that apparently we can't get
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
right now um to the governor's
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
presentation yesterday to finance and I
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
was going to ask if there was a written
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
version of that we were rather uh
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
preoccupied yesterday and uh so uh if
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
there is I'm sure that everybody on this
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
committee would would love to have that
 
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
and then uh regarding the Draft House
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill to I just I guess this is a
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
question more for the chair um is there
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
any way that we can get that because it
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
it does bear on our work I tax tax rates
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
are part of it but uh there's definitely
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
an overlap
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
taxes I will be contact with
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative wer right after this
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
meeting thank
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
you if I might represent major just to
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
make a comment if if you do get a copy
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
of the Draft House bill to that came
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office when House
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 is introduced it may look a lot
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
different there may be some cleanup
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
language there may be
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
reorganization of where sections are so
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to make the committee aware
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
of that so if you start working on
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
something and you're referencing draft
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
document when you get the real house
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill too it may not be in the same place
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
and there may be some some cleanup
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
language to make it fit the OS dra
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
drafting style understood and we put a
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
big draft right across it yep I just
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
felt I needed to say that that's all
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's important to say but
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the same uh same uh
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh that the finance
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee members have with respect to a
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
draft document like this to treat it as
 
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.430 align:start position:0%
draft document like this to treat it as
a

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
draft agreed and and that was mentioned
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
to them it's just we just wanted to make
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
sure that there's not confusion going
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
forward um typically you know it's
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
treated like an LSR you know it's an
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
individual's Bill and they um it's up to
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
them to release the language that's
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
associated with that um but usually you
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
mean you're moving much quicker with
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
house bill to than you have in past
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
years which is which is good and bad in
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
some ways if it could be drafted and
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
introduced you know ASAP that would be
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
the best course so there's no confusion
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
as you move forward about what sections
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and what the
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
impacts of those sections are so I'm
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
just just a cautionary note that's all
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
but I understand the committee needs and
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
would like to see language as they do
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
their work it's the same way with our
 
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.590 align:start position:0%
their work it's the same way with our
Revenue

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
estimates initial will be dropped and
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
they will continually to be changed
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
depending upon the economy up to the
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
point of Committee of conf have to make
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
the final vote on the budget
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
so all right you can continue Mr I've
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
got my hand up here I've had my hand up
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
represent Brony yeah um for Chris and
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
for Matt um you did provide us a summary
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
document of the of the hb2
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
changes uh as part of the packet that we
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
got uh maybe maybe that's a good spot to
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
start are there any surprises here I
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
mean they they are there other changes
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
that aren't captured here that we should
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
know about um and I'm assuming you're
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
going eventually go through this
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
document I don't know if Chris this is
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
Chris's document or yours
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
Matt rep brami that's a document that
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
Matt provided based on my request to him
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
that came from you that was the
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
applicability dates related to the tax
 
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
changes right right that Matt and his
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
presentation will'll be going over these
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
things okay all right yes and and thank
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and representative obami
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
that is a excerpt from house bill to as
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh it was submitted
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
um there may be other ancillary impacts
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
that occur in hb2 but those are the bulk
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
of what we would be would be relevant
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
for today's conversation relative to tax
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
rates um and the committee's work to
 
00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
write estimates uh to close this bium
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
and into the next bium so uh I wouldn't
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
say that it is 100% but it's the vast
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
majority um of what those changes look
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
like so was just saying the smaller
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
tweak TW there's other potentially other
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
tweaks in the the current law okay yes
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
but not anything that would impact um
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
the tax rates that we would need to
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
estimate on and I think one example
 
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:44.919 align:start position:0%
would be uh the tobacco settlement um
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
allocation to the education trust fund
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
for example in current law it's stated
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
affirmatively at 40 million these
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates look that the amount
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
will be below 40 million so there's a
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying Vision that's that will be
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
introduced in
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 um to address that things of that
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
nature right things that wouldn't impact
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
the committee's ability to make
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
estimates on uh those dollar amounts
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
you okay well I don't way to let uh
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
Matthew make his
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
and just to continue what I would say is
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
when and even looking back at this
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee's work a few short months ago
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
in 's early days and where we didn't
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
know where things were going the
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
shortfall that we're projecting at this
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
point is now below $50 million and if
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
you look at the Surplus statement that's
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
included in the executive summary
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
booklet uh we're thinking that the rainy
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
day fund will be uh very healthy even
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
once we have covered the shortfall from
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
this bium that gives us a very strong
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
base to make our estimates from uh even
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
under current law and what I would say
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
as far as as this process this was a
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
consultative process again working
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
closely with Dr working closely with
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
commissioners of different agencies uh
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
to develop these Revenue estimates based
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
on actuals for 2020 actuals for the
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
first six months of fiscal year
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
2021 and then do monthly estimates for
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
the remaining months of this bium before
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
applying a growth factor for
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
fy22 and then a similar process for FY
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
23 so it's a very granular process where
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
we attempted to identify where taxes
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
would change on the short-term basis to
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
create a base that we could estimate on
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
for the much greater uncertainty in
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 and fiscal
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
23 and what I'll share with the
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee here um is a summary of the
 
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.870 align:start position:0%
committee here um is a summary of the
taxes

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
where our estimates fall compared to
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
those Dr ranges and I apologize that
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
maybe is a little bit smaller um than
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
what I had hoped to have for you today
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and Matthew uh what you show on the
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
screen will be be provided a copy yes
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to email this after the
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
conclusion of today's work session for
 
00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:22.430 align:start position:0%
conclusion of today's work session for
the

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee um but what you see here uh in
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
the top what's shaded in that black box
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
are all taxes aggregated and it shows
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
where the agency provided a range all of
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
those compounded together shows where
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's Revenue estimates in hb1
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
under current law where we fall in that
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
range you can see that overall we're
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
very much in the thickest part of that
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
band um very close to the median other
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
tax estimates such as meals and rooms or
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax uh were
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
very bullish compared to the agency
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
projections of where those taxes will
 
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.669 align:start position:0%
projections of where those taxes will
close

00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
fy21 uh which gives us a higher base to
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
estimate from for 22 and
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
23 now what this chart doesn't show is
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
how wide those ranges are right and if
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
you look um down below at the range say
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
for business taxes you're going from 800
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
million to 824 million in fy21 is that
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
banned which is much wider than say uh
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
something like the real estate transfer
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
tax where the entirety of this band is
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
only about $10
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
million um so there are some some
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
graphical challenges that I do do want
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
to point out for the committee um but I
 
00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
do think this is a a helpful visual way
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
to show where the governor's estimates
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
are under current law um compared to the
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
range that the agency has provided and
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
again just underscoring that everything
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
that we've put forward does fall within
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
those ranges and I'm happy to answer
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
questions and and have any type of
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
debate um on how bullish or bearish we
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
should be under that current law
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
forecast what I will say is that these
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates were compiled based on
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
in most cases actual data through
 
00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:28.470 align:start position:0%
in most cases actual data through
December

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
for business taxes meals and rooms
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends we were able to
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
compare those amounts to January actuals
 
00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519 align:start position:0%
that were published in the monthly
 
00:30:41.519 --> 00:30:42.470 align:start position:0%
that were published in the monthly
Revenue

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
Focus um so some taxes and you'll see
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
this in the the Excel spreadsheet that
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
Chris Shay has put
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
together some of those estimates uh you
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
have more updated data than we do um in
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
some of those instances and I'm happy to
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
talk through that as well but the
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
overarching point is that under current
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
law these estimates are are well within
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
range um and I'm happy to talk more
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
about the process that we went through
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
to identify these specific uh dollar
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
amounts the other thing that I want to
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
show with the committee and I think this
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
will be helpful as well would be
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
the uh tax change
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
document um that Chris has provided you
 
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
with as well and this would be the
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
changes to current tax law relative to
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax the business
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and the interest in
 
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.350 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and the interest in
dividends

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
tax so I'll start with meals and rentals
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
is I think this one might be the most
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward to explain this budget
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
proposes a reduction from 9% to8 and a
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
half% effective for taxable periods
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
beginning on or after OCT October 1st
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
2021 so essentially in the second
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
quarter of the first fiscal year of
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
bium um to allow for a phase in for
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
those entities to uh be made aware of
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the change in tax law and also update
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
any of their uh collection or remittance
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
procedures uh to
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
Dr um the second and I guess if there
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
are any questions on um just the the
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
wording or the impact
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax happy to take
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
a pause here before going on to the
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax representative
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
brne yeah this is a minor thing but I'm
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
looking at uh F the 88 cents to a dollar
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
and that still stays at nine cents that
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
seems like kind of well shouldn't that
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
be eight and a half as
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
well that is a the DAT is a fair point
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I know there's a lot of
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
Legacy behind Behind these amounts under
 
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:00.870 align:start position:0%
Legacy behind Behind these amounts under
a

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
dollar um I don't know if the committee
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
would want to revisit this because I
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
don't know that these have been updated
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
in quite some time um but we certainly
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any opposition to reducing
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
um uh letter F or sub paragraph F uh to
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
eight and a half
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
cents it just didn't seem logical that's
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
all um I mean eight and a half is the
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
eight and a half at at Dollar and above
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm having I'm not having heartburn
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
over it but it just seems it's a little
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
anomalous a little bit
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
represent represent a you have your hand
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
up I did have my hand up but I was going
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
to make the same point which is
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
unimportant that it should be eight and
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
a half cents and half so just agree with
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative abami is a very minor
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
Point represent Aly thank you on those
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
are in there for a purchase of under 10
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
cents there is no half cent available
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere you can't put it on a check you
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
can't put it uh you can't bring out a
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you representative and
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
that could very well be why Dr opted to
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
not adjust sub paragraph F when we ask
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
them to compile language for these tax
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
changes as is our practice um so whether
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
that should be eight or nine um again I
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have a strong
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
preference um one way or the other on
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
that particular aspect of this
 
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.149 align:start position:0%
that particular aspect of this
change

00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
represent if there's any uh purchase
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
under 10 cents left in the world
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
anyway that was a
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
followup rep your yeah I was just going
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
to say but we do calculate things in
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
tenths of a scent fuel for one uh and
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's still a valid unit of measure
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
no more questions uh go ahead
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
Matthew Mr chairman I think
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury might have a
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
question oh represent spb I didn't I
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
thought I saw your hand up once but
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I just I just want to clarify
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
this because I think it got mudded again
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I have to agree with representative
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
Aly the only point of little a through
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
little uh f is to pin down what occurs
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
when a purchase is under $1
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
dollar G is the
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
action so you can't split a penny if
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
you're trying to charge somebody at a
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
England and again I would question
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not these Legacy sections are
 
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
still essential to the law I think
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's something for the legislature to
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
aine on um but I agree that a it would
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
not change the fiscal impact whether
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
this was eight or nine for purchases
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
between 88 cents and a dollar
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
um and the intent is that eight and a
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
half would be the amount um for
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
purchases under this tax um and
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
purchases below a dollar however the
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee would like to address that um
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
there there is not a strong opinion um
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
from us on that particular Point okay I
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
on okay excellent and thank you Mr
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um moving down to the business
 
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.349 align:start position:0%
chairman um moving down to the business
Enterprise

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
taxs um there are two components in
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
bet one of which is the threshold
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
increase uh and of course there are two
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
ways that a business can qualify or or
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
meet the threshold to pay bet one of
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
which is their gross receipts the other
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
is their Enterprise uh tax value base or
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
base value I
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
apologize this budget would propose
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 in current law they are set at
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for Enterprise uh base
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
value based on cost of inflation that
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
has since risen to
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
$1,000 this proposal increases that to
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
250,000 for gross receipts in current
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
law that is established at
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
200,000 again with those cost of or
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
those Consumer Price Index adjustments
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
that the department has the discretion
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
to make that is increased to
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
$222,000 and again this budget proposal
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
would raise that to
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
$250,000 as well um and I apologize that
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
I did not copy section 94 uh into this
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
document which shows those changes but
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
again it's just changing those threshold
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
amounts for the rate reduction
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
this budget proposes reducing the BET
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
rate for all periods ending on or after
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
December 31st
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
2022 by five basis points from
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
0.55 notably this budget does not make
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
any changes to the business profits tax
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
I know there are several bills in the
 
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislature that propose to make
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments to both of these taxes and I
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
know historically these taxes have been
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
adjusted in unison the rationale that
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're using um to reduce bet but not the
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is that we know the
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
be is the tax that small businesses pay
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
the tax that Mom and Pop shops on Main
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
Street pay and when we think about
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
accelerating this economic recovery we
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that businesses here
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
in New hampsh
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
that need the most relief have that
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
available to them um which explains the
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in bet as opposed to the
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and happy to take
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
any questions on this proposed change
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
questions representa me thank you Mr
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
chairman on do you have any idea from Dr
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
yet I guess I don't know if we're seeing
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
them this after I hope we are on about
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
how many on what percentage of the small
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
B of the businesses paying the business
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax would drop out we had
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenges as you
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
probably know uh about this on before
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
the BET came in that the BPT payers were
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
paying almost all of the tax and there
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
weren't very many of them and therefore
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
um the um Supreme Court should rule
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
against the the
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
BPT and um I've always worried when we
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
increase the threshold about whether
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
we're getting to a point where we're
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond um where we're challengeable
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
again thank you for that question
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative um and I I am aware of
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Provisions regarding
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
um the tax base and ultimately how broad
 
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
of a base that is um uh this has not
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly been evaluated for a
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional um Pro uh analysis I'm
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
happy to bring that back um and and
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
report back to the committee on if we do
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
have any concerns there uh based on dr's
 
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.990 align:start position:0%
have any concerns there uh based on dr's
initial

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
analysis approximately 30,000
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
businesses would fall within that
 
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.270 align:start position:0%
businesses would fall within that
threshold

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
um raising the Enterprise based value
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
from again
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
$111,000 today to
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 through this change um but let
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
me confer with them as far as the total
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
number of payers that still remain um
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
and if they do have any concerns there U
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the question and I'm
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
happy to follow back
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
up could I follow up just briefly follow
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
up thank you on when we looked at this
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
before I was comparing it at any rate
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of payers on that the number
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
of payers in the business Enterprise tax
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
versus the BPT the the ratio that was
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
established by the people who put in the
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
BET um just to use it as a rule of thumb
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
I have no idea whether that's a correct
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
way to do it or not
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
okay I will I will take a look at that
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
representative and try to use that as a
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
proxy um for you and I'm happy to
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
connect offline as well um based on the
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
work you've already done in this
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
while I have a question for you Matthew
 
00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:51.710 align:start position:0%
while I have a question for you Matthew
what

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
happens if House Bill 10 which reduces
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
BET passes as
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
is how would you adjust your
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
budget well ultimately I would I would
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage the legislature to do
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
any tax changes through House Bill 2 um
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a standalone um so my hope
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
is that those Provisions would be
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the budget um and
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
from there I believe it's the
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
legislator's affirmative decision on as
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
to whether or not to reduce the business
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
profits tax um I think there are are
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
strong reasons on both sides when it
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
comes to how businesses pay taxes in the
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
state um and again this budget does not
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
propose a reduction to the business
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
profits tax um but of course the
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
governor uh does support that he has
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
signed that previously um and that was
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
something that was introduced uh in his
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh the budget for the current bium so
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
our position has not changed um but when
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
we looked at where we can deploy tax
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
relief to make sure it does span the
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
entire economy we wanted to look to
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
other taxes as well which is why you see
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the separate reductions in rooms and
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
meals um and increasing the BET
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
threshold um to make sure that those
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
small businesses the ones that have been
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
hit hardest by the economic uh impacts
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh see the relief directed at them um
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
and provide the greatest opportunity to
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
enhance that economic recovery um I
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
think as as many of us
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
know and I'm sure all of you know um the
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
economic recovery uh for the largest
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
Fortune 500 companies has been uh fairly
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
robust I think we've seen that not only
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
through the business profits tax
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
payments but also um the the overall
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
market performance
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
um so that we saw this as an opportunity
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that tax relief is directed
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh where it's most
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you um so just back to the
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
BET threshold change um I think you said
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
that you had meant to supply but uh uh
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
you will if we ask for it the uh section
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
94 changes you walked us through them
 
00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
verbally but it would be helpful to have
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
that um and then
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
um if perhaps you said this or perhaps
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
you going to come to this but I'd like
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
to know exactly how you calculated the
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
revenue in impact of the
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
threshold of these changes in the
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
thresholds certainly and I'm actually
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
just going to copy um this language into
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
this word document and I will share it
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
with the committee at the conclusion of
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
this as well um so one second if this
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
works and I'll have this reformatted um
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
but as you can see the changes in
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
current law compared to what we're
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
proposing through this budget um and
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
then we still retain that Consumer Price
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
Index uh adjustment as well okay that's
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you so I'll I'll clean
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
this up make sure you have the most
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
updated version and I do apologize that
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
this wasn't included the initial version
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
I sent
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
over um to the second part of your
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
question representative regarding the uh
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
impact of these tax
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
changes um so we asked the Department of
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration to conduct a
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis for a variety of tax
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
options some that were more aggressive
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
others that were less aggressive um in a
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
variety of
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
areas uh they did pull together that
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
static fiscal analysis based on
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the most recently completed fiscal
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
year uh for that um for that individual
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
tax and uh what you'll see at the bottom
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
section of that uh worksheet that cret
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
has put together and provided to the
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee um you'll see that there are
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
three different aspects of how this
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
reduction to the business Enterprise ta
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
tax would carry through on the Surplus
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
statement um and Chris I don't know if
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
we can share that once more just to talk
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
through that and then I'll come back to
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
the document that I was working
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
off do you want me to share the
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
comparison sheet Matt if you could that
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
you so you should see it
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
now yes you want to go
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the the gov proposed changes to
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
current law so we're looking at lines
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
2728 and 29 are the three that are all
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
directly tied to the proposal to reduce
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
the bet uh rate and increase the
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
threshold and I'll walk through these
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
one by
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
one um so by increasing the threshold we
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
would see
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
approximately an annual impact of $2.3
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
million each year as a result of
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
business businesses no longer needing to
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
file um or qualified to file for the
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
bet uh so you see that reduction in each
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
year when we decrease the rate from 6 to
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
0.55 we do see a larger impact in FY
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
23 as opposed to
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
fy22 and that's primarily due to how tax
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
years overlap with fiscal years uh and I
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
would defer to dra to explain um the
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
finer details of that but essentially we
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
would see more businesses have a taxable
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
period um that is applicable to this
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
lower rate um when they file their
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly estimates in FY 23 so even
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
though we're taking no further action to
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the rate in FY 223 that impact is
 
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.870 align:start position:0%
reduce the rate in FY 223 that impact is
more

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
pronounced the third thing and this is
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
um something that again I'm sure the
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee is aware of but was
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
interesting to
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
consider when Dr did provide this
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
analysis for the governor's office um is
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
that because bet is held as a credit
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
against the business profits
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
tax we would see offsetting Revenue
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
increases in the BPT as a result of this
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
action and when a business files this
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
tax essentially they calculate their BPT
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
obligation and then reduce that amount
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
by what their bet obligation is um and
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
you see those cmeasured
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
impacts um in row 29 and again more
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
pronounced in the second year of the
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
bium even though we're not taking any
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
23 and happy to take any questions on
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
that point and I I hope that answered
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
question representative Asim I know
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's what what started us down this
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
path so I hope that helps I need to
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
raise my
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
hand you all
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
start no wait a
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
minute um yeah no I've got I do have a
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
followup question sorry just struggling
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah the uh that's that's helpful um
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to see and I imagine we'll
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
get it from Dr the uh detail on how
 
00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
that loss of $2.3 million attributable
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
to the threshold increase was uh was
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
calculated um but uh going beyond
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
that my my follow-up question is whether
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
you you must have done this uh
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
calculated um impacts going forward from
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
FY 23 and this is a question that uh
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
relates not just to these tax changes
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
because the impact will be different
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
just as you noted the FY 23 impact is
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
different from the
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
fy22 impact it all relates to when
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay their taxes um and when
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
they do their estimates and so forth um
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
but uh it the the uh largest impact uh
 
00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:51.870 align:start position:0%
but uh it the the uh largest impact uh
that

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
um that we should have information and
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
going forward Beyond the 2-year bium is
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
the in DX where you've got a phase out
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh number
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
6.3 in FY 23 but you know perfectly
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a hugely different number
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
um as you go forward from there so I my
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
question is about impact Beyond this uh
 
00:52:18.799 --> 00:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
question is about impact Beyond this uh
twoyear

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
twoyear
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
window right can we that until
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
get sure
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
but what about
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
business uh so for the business
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax um I do have information
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
that I can provide to the committee um
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
that does come from Dr uh that does
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
detail those annual impacts based on
 
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.390 align:start position:0%
detail those annual impacts based on
these

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
changes um and I'm I'm happy to provide
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
essentially the the full impact of this
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
tax change is felt beginning in fiscal
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
2024 and forward the vast majority of
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
that impact is felt in FY
 
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
23 as
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
85% um
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
of the percent applicable to the given
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
tax year would be captured in FY 23 um
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
but there would be a smaller um Step
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
Up in FY 24 and that would be um the
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
continual impact absent future changes
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
to this tax
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
rate okay that's helpful um and I I'd
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
love to see that I'm sure all members
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
would um and I think before anyone else
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
says it I'll say it that uh I I
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
understand and I'm sure everyone else
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
understands that these are static uh
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
these are based on a static analysis and
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's all sorts of
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
variables that one could throw in and uh
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
guesses but this is just a static
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
analysis that is correct representative
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
um and that is something that I think we
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
all will consider as we go through this
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
process um but based on the the static
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact these are are the this is
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
the analysis that was put forward um and
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
there may be other variables that the
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee may choose to add in um as
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
they would with any other decision that
 
00:54:15.799 --> 00:54:17.390 align:start position:0%
they would with any other decision that
they

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
make and your analysis based upon
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
that coming out of
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
the the pen mic so that economy is going
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
industry that that is correct Mr
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh specific to meals and
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
rooms we see a very robust recovery um
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
beginning this summer we think there is
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of pent up demand we
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
think that people that maybe visited New
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the first time during the
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic um tend we tend to think they
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
enjoyed their time here we know a lot of
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
them have stayed permanently um so we do
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
expect people to change their habits
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
coming out of Co and and we think that
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
has a positive impact for the economy uh
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
overall anything that we can do to
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
attract more people to come and stay or
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
visit or recreate in New Hampshire um
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
given our very vibrant tourism economy
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
certainly helps the state coffers the
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
second with the
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
BET as representative am said this is a
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
and and two 2023 isn't that far
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
out but 2023 can still be affected quite
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
a bit by what happens through covid this
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
year that is certainly true
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
representative and I will also say from
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
a methology standpoint um we
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
extrapolated based on our base for fy2
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
21 for the estimates in the two years of
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
the next bium um so any increase that we
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
see for the fy21 base would Cascade
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
through this the multiple fiscal years
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
um by virtue of how we conducted the
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
analysis did you have any input from
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services relative to uh
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
how the pandemic is going to be
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
handled yes so we did have uh
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
representatives from DH HS as part of
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
the informal Revenue commission that we
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
assembled um to vet these numbers um and
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know I think there was agreement
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
that there was a tremendous amount of
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
uncertainty for where we close fy21 and
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
where we see ourselves in fy22 but we
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
did feel confident that the underlying
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
assumptions were valid um and the other
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
thing that I would say is if anything
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 continues to outperform
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh where we expected it to be in light
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Co and just to to pinpoint one
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
example um in February we expected all
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
Dr taxes to be down 7% compared to plan
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
in aggregate um and based on the latest
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
numbers uh from Dr it sounds as though
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a very conservative
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
estimate um and very likely that the
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
state will exceed plan uh for the month
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
of February um so again I think
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
that it's one of those things that is
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
difficult the committee certainly has
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
the luxury of more time and more
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
economic data uh especially in the
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
months ahead and of course even more so
 
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
on the Senate side but we feel
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable that this is our best foot
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
forward that we can um you know take
 
00:57:46.589 --> 00:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
that first step from the governor's
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
point of view um and if anything these
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates may continue to
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
improve as the committee receives
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
additional data
 
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
ask you one more question um what would
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
be the result of FY three on the bet
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
changes if you use the
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
conditions we did not specifically model
 
00:58:23.029 --> 00:58:23.039 align:start position:0%
um a pandemic we didn't do any modeling
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
specific to the pandemic um but we see
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
data much in the same way that you do um
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
where Dr provides an estimate um and
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
then we conduct an analysis of if that
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
estimate is is too bullish or too
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
bearish or right on the money um and
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
what I would say if we point back to
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
that uh graph that I showed earlier
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
business taxes under current law are
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
well below the 50th percentile compared
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
to what that range provided by Dr is so
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
if anything business taxes could be
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
revised upward compared to where they
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
hb1 okay represent
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
El thank you on I have a number of
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
questions but I think on the discussion
 
00:59:23.549 --> 00:59:23.559 align:start position:0%
has has taken care of one of them but
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
specifically for um for the
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
B um business tax are you based which
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
year on was Dr basing this on that you
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
took is a static analysis from 18 or 19
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
20 uh this
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
analysis was based on fiscal year 20
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
cash basis Revenue
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
plus the anomalous receivables that
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
fy20 okay so it is the and for the
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
threshold increase the department used
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
tax year 18 to calculate uh their fiscal
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
analysis that we reviewed for
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
that so the
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
threshold was
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
18 yes and again I I am happy to provide
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
the the underlying methodology of the
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
tax proposals that we did move forward
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
with um from Dr after this meeting um
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
there are separate analyses in here that
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
we did not move forward with that I
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
would just want to um review before um
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
sending this
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
over thank you I think it it really does
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
make a difference which year we're
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
looking at um but uh and then also think
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is more for finance than for us but
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to look at the split on
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
have you looked at what effect the
 
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
changing on proportions of bet and and
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
BPT are going to do to to the revenue
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
going into the general fund and the
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
ETF yes that is something that we did
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
consider um based on current law and
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
there's no proposal to deviate from
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
current law into how those allocations
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
occur um for bet the analysis is the
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
revenue raised by uh half a percentage
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
Point divided by the current rate uh so
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
right now it is um 0.5 divided by 6 is
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
that calculation the department goes
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
through and for fiscal year
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
23 uh we have updated that to account
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
for the uh different rate that would be
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
in effect at that time it's my
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the calculation does use
 
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh data that is one year in a rear so
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
that impact would only be felt in fiscal
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
23 um but if I have misstated that I
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
would encourage uh the department to
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
correct me um if any of that is is not
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
quite 100%
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
accurate I could have a quick followup
 
01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:27.150 align:start position:0%
accurate I could have a quick followup
on

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that the statutory
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
language has uh is uh adequate for all
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
of the changes that have been made to
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
the reductions in the BET and the BPT in
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
the last six eight years whatever it is
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
now um that it was based on the original
 
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.670 align:start position:0%
now um that it was based on the original
tax

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
rates Thank
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
You by represent Bernstein Bron
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.829 align:start position:0%
You by represent Bernstein Bron
representative

01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
tuer you like to have my question now
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes I'm uh represent Coos 5 so I'm
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
very involved in thinking about
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hospitality as everyone else is in Coos
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
5 and across Coos so I'm very interested
 
01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.309 align:start position:0%
5 and across Coos so I'm very interested
in

01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
how uh the group came up with 8.5 in the
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
meals and
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
rentals rather than the status quo or
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
we'll say 8% could you discuss a little
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
bit uh how you landed on
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
8.5 sure so we we did conduct analysis
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
at at varying levels um of reductions or
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
the status quo uh for meals and rent
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
tax um I don't know that there was any
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
magic number behind 8.5
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
other than that we felt it was a sizable
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
reduction that would have impacts and
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
would signal to uh both New Hampshire
 
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
residents and also out of state visitors
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is doing everything
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
it can to help small businesses
 
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.549 align:start position:0%
it can to help small businesses
including

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants um and we see this as an
 
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.109 align:start position:0%
restaurants um and we see this as an
opportunity

01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
to um reduce U that tax rate uh in a way
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
that will help stimulate economic
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
activity and help Drive the recover
 
01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.670 align:start position:0%
activity and help Drive the recover
recovery

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
forward um but I don't believe that
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
we're married to 8.5 as opposed to 8%
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
other than to say we believe a reduction
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
is the right policy for the state to
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
pursue uh and there are benefits um that
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
will Cascade throughout the economy by
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
taking that
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
action thank you represent burnson thank
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
question Matt my question regards the
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
increase in the threat threshold of the
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
bet you mentioned well it shows there'll
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
be a revenue reduction of 2.3 million if
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
we divide that by the 30,000 small
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
businesses affected by this we get $77
 
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.589 align:start position:0%
businesses affected by this we get $77
per

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:13.549 align:start position:0%
per
business

01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to how 250,000 as a
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
threshold is The Sweet Spot what would
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
happen if that number went up to 300,000
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
or went down to 200,000 how'd you land
 
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.750 align:start position:0%
or went down to 200,000 how'd you land
that

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
so we did look at a number of different
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
factors and a number of different
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
proposals uh that Dr was asked to
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
consider uh ranging from say 150,000 to
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
250,000 um there were commerate tax rate
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
or um sorry tax revenue impacts at those
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
different levels spanning from 1.5
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
million each year at
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
150,000 um it's the number you see there
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
before you would 2.3 each year for
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
250,000 um and ultimately what I think
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
the the benefit here is if that you're a
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
small business maybe you're a business
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's just getting started um and
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
you're falling within that threshold
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
between 100,000 and
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
250,000 um there is benefit to reducing
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
some of that administrative overhead
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
especially for businesses that are just
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
getting started um or maybe it's an
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur who had event
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
and uh Co had adverse impacts maybe they
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
had to shift away from that and pivot to
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
where they saw new opportunity we want
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
to make this tax um less burdensome on
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
those small entities and allow that type
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
of innovation uh and Foster additional
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for small business owners
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
and and that's why we chose to increase
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
it um based on representative aly's
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
comments I I do want to just go back and
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
look at any that has been you know put
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
on paper regarding um whether or not the
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
base is Broad enough to satisfy
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional Provisions um so I will
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
follow up with the committee on that I
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'll have a definitive
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
answer but at least to say that we've
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
considered it at this point um but I I
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative you did and thank
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
bronley um I do have some questions on
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
the several of the lines but I think uh
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh we should allow uh um the
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
finalization of the presentation on the
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax reduction
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
first and then we can uh then I'll raise
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
my hand again and ask additional
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
question so can he proceed with his to
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
finish his uh discussion of the of that
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
other uh sheet that had the summary of
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
the the three tax reductions that were
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
in play we haven't talked about the
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax reduction yet
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
oh we're still on the bet so you want me
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
to ask my bet questions now
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
I mean these are more General nothing to
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
do with tax reduction okay uh so do you
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
want me to hold on that or do you want
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
my my be questions now go ahead so when
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
you when you when you did your your your
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
estimating going out uh forget about the
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
taxed you know the be uh T reduction and
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
all you had to do some
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
estimating we had two two changes in
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
play right now Market base
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
sourcing and then single sales factors
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
on the books
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
um we we feel it's very hard to predict
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
the impact of especially the single
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
sales Factor um in the out years here on
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
this budget um can you can you tell us
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
how you handled that I mean we we
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
obviously would like to slow that change
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
down on on on house ways and means but
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
assuming it goes
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
through uh and not not changed then that
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
there'll be an impact especially out on
 
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.470 align:start position:0%
there'll be an impact especially out on
on

01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
2023 um even the
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
Bia uh their members are split on
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
whether this is going to be a good thing
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
or a bad thing um so how how did you
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
weigh both Market based sourcing into
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
this and single sales factor into your
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
estimates um which seem pretty robust
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
going out I'm pretty bullish on the
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
business taxes be honest on the business
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue I think businesses especially
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
our our most of the BPT is from the big
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
larger companies I understand so but but
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
we're not sure what the impact is going
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
to be with single sales Factor obviously
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming the government feels a
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
little more bullish about it than we do
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
that certainly representative and I
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
agree that I think when you look at
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
where the business taxes fall on that
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
range that I showed earlier um there may
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
be room uh
 
01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
for for Ways and Means to to expand upon
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
that as they see more economic data come
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
in um what I can say is the governor's
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
budget did not propose any changes um to
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
either single sales factor or
 
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.950 align:start position:0%
either single sales factor or
market-based

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
market-based
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
sourcing um and that when we were
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of Revenue
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
information they have a lot of the same
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
question and uncertainty of exactly
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
where those impacts will be um so I I
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak too much only to say
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
that this is is a going to be a robust
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
change and um until we see that first
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
bits of data come in um that's when we
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
know but I do think that these estimates
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
are conservative to the point where even
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
if um those impacts turned out to be
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
adverse for one reason or another um
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
business tax performance likely to your
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
point uh will be more bullish uh over
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
these next two years and as far as what
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
we estimate out uh for business
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
taxes uh was a modest
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
2.25% increase uh from the fy21 base and
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
then a 5% increase to the FY
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
23 um based on in compounding on that
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
fy22 estimate um so again we see
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to grow um for these
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
business taxes especially with the
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
reductions that we're making um to the
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
tax rate so I I appreciate those
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
comments and I'm happy to Circle back
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
either offline or in more detail at a
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
later date right on single sales factor
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
in market-based sourcing just a follow
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
up then so so the governor the
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
governor's office you you and the
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
governor are pretty forget about covid
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
and all
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
that just on on single sales Factor I'm
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that the governor feels that
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to be more of a positive
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
than a
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
negative that's yes that's certain
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh why we had supported uh the policy um
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
to put it on the books uh again I I
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
think the the fiscal analysis is
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
something um that I know there's debate
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
on uh I know Co is certainly something
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
that that will weigh into the
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee's decision but our position
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed uh and again there are no
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
proposed changes in the budget that
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
would either delay or undo those
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
changes okay thank
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
you representative elme thank you Mr
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
chair on just a followup to that is
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
there any evidence anywhere whatsoever
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
that a small elderly State on with a lot
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
of manufacturing that exports just about
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
everything to sales in other states on
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
is going to gain from single sales
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
Factor when our biggest tax
 
01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.510 align:start position:0%
Factor when our biggest tax
is

01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
on is about what is it 80 90% of it
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
companies uh so representative I
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question um I would
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate a chance to Circle back with
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
you on on that particular Point yeah I
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
wish you'd Circle back with the whole
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee okay I I'm happy to do that um
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
but let me just I haven't uh specific
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
Ally pulled that data for this morning's
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
conversation I know it's something the
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee is continuing to work through
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
um but but happy to to bring that back
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee the committee is as a
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
this further questions on the
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
BET tax
 
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
changes all right now we can go to the
 
01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.950 align:start position:0%
changes all right now we can go to the
IND

01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
CH excellent and uh Chris if you could
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
stop sharing your screen um I guess it
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
won't allow me to do that until you go
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you so much
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
um for the interest in dividends tax
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
what and I know there are several
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
proposals in the legislature as well
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
that might use different mechanisms to
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
get to essentially the same spot um this
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
tax we propose to
 
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
use a 5-year phase out uh at a linear
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
Glide path uh so that the tax is
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated at the end of
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
2026 or for taxable periods ending
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
December 31st
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
2026 um notably this tax change does not
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
begin in the first year of the
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
bium um this would only impact the
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
second year of the next bium uh going
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
from five down uh to 4%
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
the thinking is that given the
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
uncertainty surrounding Co we wanted to
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that the legislature had a
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
window of opportunity that should things
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh either not recover as fast um to to
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity to see a Year's
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
data past covid um before this
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
particular tax impact would take effect
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
um obviously from a policy standpoint we
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally believe it's the right
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
thing to do uh New Hampshire is proud to
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
be an income taxfree State uh it's part
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
of our core New Hampshire Advantage uh
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
and by phasing this tax out we can
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
remove the aster U of income taxfree and
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know say that affirmatively the way
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
other states can that there's no tax on
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
income whether it be your paycheck your
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
interest or dividends that you might
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
receive and we know this tax
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacts seniors um
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
that are living on fixed incomes and may
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
be either uh wholly or mostly reliant on
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
these uh sources of income uh to sustain
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
their retirement uh and again to the
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
extent that this encourages more people
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
to stay in New Hampshire or relocate to
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you see other positive
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
economic impacts whether it be through
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals or other taxes that we
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
might see um both at the state and local
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
level um and again from a from policy
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
stand point we fundamentally believe
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
that that now is the opportunity to take
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
this step uh it's something that's been
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
debated for a long time right I think uh
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
in some cases maybe even the past 50
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
years this has been an ongoing
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
conversation uh and we're very excited
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to put this into house bill
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
too uh and happy to answer any questions
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
on the interest and dividends
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
tax well thank you uh represent
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you um just uh it looks is
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
this a mistake or am I somehow not
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
reading it correctly you uh you
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
have the annual tax rate at 5% for all
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending onor before
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
December 31 oh I get it h after forget
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
it I'm all
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
set okay um what would it look like in
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
that it only affects us in
 
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.470 align:start position:0%
that it only affects us in
200

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
20 wait a
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
minut 23 what would
 
01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:46.590 align:start position:0%
minut 23 what would
[Music]

01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
20 I do have a question I guess so Roman
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
1 eight says that the tax rate will be
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
5% for a tax FL period end I'm going to
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
shorten this ending on December 31
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
2023 Roman 2 says that the tax rate
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
shall be at 4% for a taxable period
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
ending on December 31
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
2023 so I'm not sure you got this right
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
that is a a good point it does appear
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
that tax periods ending specifically on
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
the 31st of December
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
would be captured uh in both of those
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
statements this is again a product of
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
working with draft legislation that will
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
be cleaned up by legislative services
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
but I can reiterate the intent uh is for
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
this tax to expire at the end of 2026 as
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
you see Roman five and what's the first
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
4% uh I I would defer to the the
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
specific language that will be published
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
in hp2
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
but in order for this tax to sunset at
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
the end of 2026 you would see taxable
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
periods ending after December
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
2023 right so essentially ending on in
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
Roman one should I believe and again I'm
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
not uh a legislative drafter of this
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
particular language but um should not be
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
inclusive of December 31st 2023 in Roman
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
1 um but I don't know if Chris I see he
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
has his hand up and and maybe the LBA
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
has already um reviewed this with OS
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
Chris so Matt's um kind of hitting the
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
nail on the head you know as as OS goes
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
through the language they'll Identify
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
some of these types of issues and then
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
they would come back and talk with um
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
the governor's office or our office to
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
help clarify you know what the intent is
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
so again this is just another one of
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
those um concerns that we have that when
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
the dra language might be used by the
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee you may end up getting more
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
confused than you would if you have the
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
actual house buillt two to look
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
at but yes we would try to get it
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
cleaned up with OS and working with the
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office to make sure that it
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
was okay
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I I'm amazed how many errors
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
get through alls so it's always good to
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
spot them when you see them but it looks
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
to me like in Roman numerales 2 three
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
four and
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
five simply taking the word on or
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
out would address representative
 
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.950 align:start position:0%
out would address representative
Ames

01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
question but when you get to the end of
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
five that's saying that the rate will be
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
1% for the period following
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2016 so this
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh end up at zero at the end of
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
26 perhaps there's some more language
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
27 so I I would again uh especially
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
given this and I appreciate uh the sharp
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
eyes on the committee pointing this out
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
um what I can say affirmatively is the
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
intent is for this tax to sunset on
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
December 31st
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
2026 I know there is also a repeal
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
provision in
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 um that removes the references to
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
this tax as well um there's I believe
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
you know several different sections that
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
are impacted with that so I did not
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
include that here in this document um
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
because again that really is a clerical
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment at that point but the
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
intent and to to represent a spilsbury's
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
point it might be as simple as removing
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
on or before and leaving the remaining
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
roaming NE rules as is or vice versa um
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
but the intent is that this t sunsets at
 
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
2026 um so again I I apologize for that
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
um and through the drafting process
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that the the words do
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
match the intent
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
um that we've
 
01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:13.719 align:start position:0%
disced if
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
um if R number one was true you
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't see any
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
effect of the ENT in div tax in 2023 is
 
01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.870 align:start position:0%
effect of the ENT in div tax in 2023 is
that

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
correct because you're going to keep it
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
at 5% up to the end
 
01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:42.510 align:start position:0%
at 5% up to the end
of

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
2023 so in
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
change there would be a fiscal impact
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
only for taxable periods in tax year
 
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
22 which based on the analysis from Dr
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
is 27% of what's applicable to that tax
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
year translates into that first fiscal
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
year so if you're
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
paying uh and I'm sorry I meant to say
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
23 um so there are impacts that would be
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
delayed it wouldn't be until fiscal
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
25 that all of the three primary tax
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
years that are paid over the course of a
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
given fiscal year would see that initial
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
reduction um and again I'm happy to uh
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
confer with Dr make sure that their
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
analysis matches the intent and that the
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
language follows that as well um and
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
again I think this again is a product of
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
working off a draft
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure OS will have an email either
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
already in our inbox or in our inbox
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
before this is introduced um to make
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
sure that this language matches the
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
intent uh and I'm happy to to make sure
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
the committee has uh the most updated
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
language um either when hb2 is released
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
or um if we can Rectify that between now
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then happy to update this document
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
and res submit it okay representor
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
Brony this is uh questions really on the
 
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.229 align:start position:0%
Brony this is uh questions really on the
broader

01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
broader
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
again forget about the reductions and
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
all that um indd have going up to 140. n
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
million in
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
2023 uh which is is quite a growth uh
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
but but so that means that after five
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
years at the minimal minimum the state's
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
gonna lose $140.9
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
million uh out you know four fiscal
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
years from now from
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
2023 so how does the governor plan to
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
make up that revenue or is it just that
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to reduce
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
expenses I understand the logic in
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
business taxes where in the business tax
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
you decrease the rate you you attract
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
more business and therefore and we've
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
we've kind of seen that
 
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
happen but with this one I'm not sure if
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have the same effect other than
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
like you said people moving here
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
and doing other taxable things I guess
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh and so just just go over the logic
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
because that's that's quite a whole
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um$ 141 million dollar a
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
year so representative abami and I
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and I I I think
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
that there are probably several
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
different layers um to to how exactly
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
the state uh would react once this tax
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
is phased out um certainly we will
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
continue to see revenue from other
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
sources increase in the intervening
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
years between where we are today and
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh 26 27 and Beyond um what
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
I would also say is that dollars are
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
fungible they do continue to flow
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the economy so to your point
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
if you're not paying $10 in interest in
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
dividends tax for example you are
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
deploying those dollars in the economy
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um what that is to purchase
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
real estate invest in a business um or
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know even just do other taxable
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
things um so I don't want to give off
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
the impression that these tax dollars
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
should be a a one for one reduction
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
because we do see opportunity for people
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh to reinvest them in the New Hampshire
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
economy and um essentially see
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
offsetting tax increases elsewhere I
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
will comment that this budget does not
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
account for those but I do think that is
 
01:27:00.189 --> 01:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
something um that the state is very
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
likely to see and experience as a result
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
of this um so I hope that answers your
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
question and I'm happy to um you know
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
dive into any one of those particular
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
areas if you'd like but um ultimately
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that the state would
 
01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
have a five-year Glide path to evaluate
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
and consider um and given the the
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
strength of business taxes and other
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
taxes that the state levies were
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
confident that this would not um impact
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
critical State Services by by taking
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
this action certainly there's minimal
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
impact on on this bium from your
 
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639 align:start position:0%
analysis here so okay I I'll let this
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
ask questions at this point thank
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
you that's a good point because let's
 
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
you that's a good point because let's
say

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
the we lose a100
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
million and that h100 million is
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
it goes into rooms and
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
meals but it will only come back to the
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
state that's taxable
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
at8 a half million so we essentially
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
lost 91 A5 million dolls it has to be
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
made up someplace
 
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
else no absolutely I I wouldn't say that
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
this would be a one for one impact but I
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
also don't know that these dollars
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
would drop off the table entirely right
 
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
if someone no longer is paying interest
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
in dividends and that gives them um the
 
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
economic capacity to start a business um
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
or grow an existing business right you
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
do see those benefits elsewhere in the
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
economy so will there be Revenue
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
reductions absolutely based on interest
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
and dividends right um and you do see a
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
proportion of those dollars come back to
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
the state in other
 
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
mechanisms um but I think again from a
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint as and that's where
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
this argument has its Genesis New
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an income taxfree State um
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
this has been a ongoing conversation we
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
know there are a couple of different
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
proposals in the legislature to get from
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
point A to point B um and we
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
fundamentally believe this is the right
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
policy for the state to pursue um and
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
the revenue impacts would not be uh
 
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
insurmountable especially given the
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
length of the time Horizon and also this
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
budget proposing to delay it a year to
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate um the strength of the economy
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
postco um you know we do see opportunity
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
there um and hope that the legislature
 
01:29:37.109 --> 01:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh will consider this proposal uh in the
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
way that you know really removes that
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
Aster from new hampsh being an interest
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
or a income taxfree
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
State when it was first talked about it
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
was a tax primarily affected the
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
elderly and if the elderly save $100
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
million is they're more or less going to
 
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
spend it on uh meals and rooms things
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
like that I doubt that many of them
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
business but anyway that's something to
 
01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
business but anyway that's something to
think

01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
about represent
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
El thank you Mr chairman on you're
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
talking about we can evaluate it the
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
first year since the Republicans started
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
putting prospective tax cuts into the
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
budgets I don't know if they ever did it
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
before uh about 10 years ago but since
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
they started doing that when you put it
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget it is almost impossible to
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
stop it if it is proving to be a
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
disaster and I am just wondering how
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
this goes together with fiscal
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this C of
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
State well thank you for the question
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
representative what I would say is that
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've looked to this budget we've
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
balanced it um based on this proposal uh
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 the same process would
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
would occur and in New Hampshire of
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
course the governor does have to present
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
a balance budget um I'm confident we
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
could do the same in 24 and 25 no matter
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
who happens to be in the corner office
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
um we don't see this as as ruinous for
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
the state by any means um yes there will
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
be fiscal impacts I don't believe that
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
they would be uh insurmountable or lead
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
to Draconian Cuts in state government or
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
state Services um and again we approach
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
this from the fundamental policy
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
prescription that this is the right
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
thing for New Hampshire to do um and and
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
that that that is the primary driver
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
behind why we are putting this forward
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
because fundamentally from a policy
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint this is something that I know
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature is is considering
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
proposals on we're excited to include it
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
in house bill to um and we do see a
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
pathway to get from five to zero over
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
the course of several years um in a way
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
overall any further questions on the
 
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
okay we've gone through the three major
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions to ask Bud
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
director do you have anything else need
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
to share with us Matthew
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I would would point
 
01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
out uh Mr chairman would be the real
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax uh and the tobacco
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
tax which you see here are the the two
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh rows at the bottom of this
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet um real estate transfer tax
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
has continued to have very robust
 
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
performance it is something that we know
 
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
is directly tied to the strength of the
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
housing market we know that the supply
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
is historically low for New Hampshire
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
homes um so at some point this ride will
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
come to an end the the question that I
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
know this committee is grappled with I
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
know the governor is grappled with and
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
odra is grappled with is what does that
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
Glide path look like um you see that we
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
are on the higher end of these ranges
 
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
Matt this is Chris can I just interrupt
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
for a second absolutely um you still
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
have the language up for the dividends
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I uh sorry thank you for
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
that I had yep changed my screen on my
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
end but had not changed it in Zoom can
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
everyone see the charts now at this
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
point yes all right sorry about that um
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
even the young kids don't quite know how
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
to use all these different software
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
programs yet um but nonetheless um so as
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
you see here real estate transfer and
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
tobacco are the two rows at the bottom
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
of the spreadsheet or or this graph that
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
you see here and you'll notice that the
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate is on the higher end
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
of those r ranges we think in large part
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
the the offramp from this Hut housing
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
market will be more gradual um on a
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
average than others might have predicted
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and we've seen that both last month
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
where the monthly estimate that we had
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
used for for Rett um that we saw in the
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
February Revenue Focus um was surpassed
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
and um it's a question and it's
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
certainly something that's worth worth
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
of debate and I know the committee has
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
heard from people in this industry as
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
well um but I just wanted to explain the
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
reason why we were or what appears to be
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
a very bullish estimate for R um and
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
then the same with tobacco right we know
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
that um our Revenue tied to Tobacco is
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
heavily dependent on policies in other
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
states I know this committee has already
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
had conversations regarding that um but
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
what you'll notice is that our estimates
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
continue to slide down the range between
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
20 21 to 22 to
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
23 um so there there is a healthy degree
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
of um a conservative estimate for
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco um and I I just wanted to point
 
01:35:37.629 --> 01:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
those two things out for the committee
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation um my
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
constituents are mostly concerned about
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
downshifting as they see the different
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
articles in the news newspaper and um I
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
I feel like you did explain the policy
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
positions very well so I appreciate that
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
they're very worried about what how hb20
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
in some variation is going to fit into
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
all of this if there's going to be
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
suddenly you know this large extra cost
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
at the same time as we're making these
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
other cuts and uh um I did step out so
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
if I missed that I apologize but that's
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
the number one concern of our
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
constituents where I am thank you
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth and and could
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
you just remind me where your district
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
is uh do in do excellent uh beautiful
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
part of the state I might add House Bill
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
20 uh is the um education savings
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
account is that that Bill yes thank you
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
I I I focused on three numbers one two
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
and 25 and to clarify what their sense
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
is if we actually pay for many of the
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
$16,000 students already in private
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
schools plus add new ones they're you
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
know estimating 80 you know 100 million
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh at the same time as we're losing some
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
of the extra education funds we had in
 
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
the last budget so you know we have some
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
worried people sure and and happy to to
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
address those concerns and as far as the
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates go um what we project
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
to be in the education trust fund at the
 
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
end of this bium uh and this is included
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
in the executive summary as well slide
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh one
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
second uh slide
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
13 we see tremendous strength in that
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so we've assumed
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
that some students will return be uh in
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
fy22 and FY 23 coming out of Co um we
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
know some of them will continue their
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
either Alternative Learning model
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether it be private school or or
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
homeschool um so some of that is assumed
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
but even if the numbers are are greater
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
than what we see
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
um or what we've projected um there is
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
still strength in the education trust
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
fund based on the revenue estimates um I
 
01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
would say if the the policy analysis of
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
of hb20 uh either for the committee or
 
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
or house finance as to whether or not um
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
that should be included in the budget or
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
not I understand there is a fiscal
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
impact but um we've kept those
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
conversations separate from what we've
 
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
put forward uh in house bill one and two
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure that'll be a robust
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
debate over the next several months
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
followup all my followup is um for many
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
around the state they're looking to see
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
more funds in education and thinking
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
that better Revenue would provide more
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
funds to especially help the property
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
poor communities and it's hard for me to
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
connect that need with cutting the
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
taxes so and I appreciate the follow-up
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
question representative what I would say
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
is even with these tax cuts we will see
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
a historically strong balance in the
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund um that includes
 
01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
the $30 million in one-time Aid that
 
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 proposes uh to provide
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
through the public school infrastructure
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
fund um this is is such a tremendous
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
departure from where we were even four
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
years ago from from the days where the
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund uh always closed
 
01:39:26.189 --> 01:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
the bium with a negative balance and
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
there was a transfer from the general
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
fund um into the education trust fund
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
partially this is driven by fewer
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
students in the classroom because of
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and people choosing um to use
 
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
different educational models for this
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
year um but what I would say is that
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
these tax cuts do not jeopardize
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
education funding um and again I I point
 
01:39:51.629 --> 01:39:51.639 align:start position:0%
you to slide 13 in the executive summary
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statements um the education
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund is is in a better place than
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
it really has ever been um since it took
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
effect two decades ago um and I think
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
that something that that speaks to the
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
strength um of the taxes that feed that
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
fund but also looking at the education
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
funding commission's report um this the
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
the the the solvency education trust
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
fund will allow the legislature to weigh
 
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
fund will allow the legislature to weigh
those

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
considerations um and identify if there
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
is a change in the formula we don't do
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
anything in the governor's budget that
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
that um necessarily responds to that the
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
one change the governor's proposed is
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
tied to how we calculate free and
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch um given the federal
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
government issued guidance removing the
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
paperwork requirement um which I think
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
was the right policy decision for the
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
federal government to take in lie of Co
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
um but the cascading impact for the
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
State education adequacy formula um
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
would have penalized in a way that uh we
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
certainly weren't uh interested in
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
continuing so that's why we've looked to
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
two preco uh levels to calculate that
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
portion of Education adequacy a in this
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
budget uh thank you and I think that
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
districts Senator
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
Brony yes uh Matt I'd like to talk about
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
two two taxes meil mail and rooms tax
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
and then the uh it's not on this on this
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
list here but the uh road toll if we can
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
because those two I feel and I think the
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
committee also feels are the two
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
toughest to predict because of uh
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
depending it's really dependent on the
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
quick those are really dependent on
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
covid uh in terms of of coming back but
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
then the other reality is will we ever
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
get a mov meals tax for instance will we
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
ever get has the model changed forever
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of businesses the way they act
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
um will there be as much business travel
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
as before or not uh you know uh will
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
more meetings continue with zoom and and
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
eliminating all that uh will people be
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
working for home longer uh continue to
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
work from home because businesses are
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
realizing that it seems to be working
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I just want to get a
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
sense uh from uh from you uh because
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
that all of that directly
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
impacts uh movement res tax if
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
businessmen aren't traveling there's no
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's no rooms there's no no meals and
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's no car
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
rentals uh and that all you know all
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
that and that Revenue that's generated
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
from that so I just want to know how
 
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
much of a discussion you had and in your
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh Circle there about this um I mean you
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're in the meal in rooms the plan in
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
two in 21 was uh call it 3 87 million
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and you are projecting 363 so you're
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're projecting it's not coming
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
back uh all the way out to
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
2023 to former
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
levels but do do you agree or not agree
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
with the premise that maybe it will
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
never come back to the to the normal to
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
the norm but well I'll leave it at that
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
well I I really appreciate the question
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative abrami um and and thank
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
you I I don't know if I spoke to that
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
earlier that even though we're on the
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
high end of the meals and rooms tax
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
range we still don't see a return even
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
to fy19 levels um out through FY 2023
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
under current law so yes we're bullish
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
on the performance but the ranges are um
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more conservative than we
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
might see for the other ones so that
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we find ourselves on the
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
higher end of that but I do appreciate
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
the historical context going back to the
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 plan
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh as far
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
as long-term durable changes and travel
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
patterns I think a fundamentally it's
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
too early to tell um but I will give you
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
a better answer than that and say right
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
now a lot of this shift from working in
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
the office versus working from home has
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
been driven by the pandemic where people
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
are doing it for public health
 
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
reasons if businesses choose to make
 
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.790 align:start position:0%
reasons if businesses choose to make
these

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
changes durable and continue in a
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
flexible manner in an environment that
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
isn't constrained by a public health
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
emergency work from home really will
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
turn into this idea of a work from
 
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere model and I do think that some
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
of the impacts of maybe business travel
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
falling off and maybe that does take a
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
long time to come back I do think you'll
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
see people choose to relocate for a week
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
or month or a season to a different
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
state right and whether that is a rental
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
or if they're purchasing property I do
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
think that you will see those types of
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
impacts once we're out of Co and even if
 
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
you know we might not see the
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
traditional business travel some of
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
those impacts will have much different
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
um or some of those actions will have
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
much different impacts in a world um
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
that isn't you know hampered by a global
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic okay thank you uh Mr chair can
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
I ask another
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
question about the tobacco tax just a
 
01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.550 align:start position:0%
question about the tobacco tax just a
comment

01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
yes we we've been you know obviously we
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
benefited from the Massachusetts law
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
change last year about the menthol
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and all and we've researched
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
this um there are a couple of bills in
 
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
the hopper in Massachusetts now it's our
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that there's really it
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like they're being acted
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
upon to resend that that policy about
 
01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.470 align:start position:0%
upon to resend that that policy about
mental

01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
mental
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um I think some members have
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
have figured out in Massachusetts that
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
they lost a lot of tax revenue from that
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
so um do have you had any of those
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
discussions right now it doesn't look
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
like anything's going to happen um but
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
but there are bills uh that are that are
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
out there in Massachusetts right now
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
were you aware of that and was that in
 
01:46:17.589 --> 01:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
your discussion at all when it comes to
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
the cigarette tax thank you
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative and yes I would say that
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
we were generally aware of it um and and
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
worked with the Department of Revenue to
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
to calculate what the impacts might be
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
um under current law and obviously if
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts were to take that action
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
or if another state were to take an
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
action that was more favorable um I
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
think that contributes to some of the
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in that range for tobacco
 
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
tax but uh we're expecting decline of
 
01:46:49.149 --> 01:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
one and a half% in
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
fy22 um from fy20 levels and you see
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we're more conservative uh where we
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
are in that range and then a reduction
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
of 3% in FY 23 uh and again moving even
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
below the median uh for FY 23 compared
 
01:47:08.669 --> 01:47:08.679 align:start position:0%
to dr's range and um obviously those are
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
uncertainties that are unknowable at
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
this point in time I think your
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
characterization is is accurate that I
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that those bills will
 
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately get across the governor's
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
desk in
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um but certainly something
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
to consider and the will have more
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
information than than we will have had
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
during the governor's phase uh to make
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
their analysis so your your reductions
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
are the normal um going back to the
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
normal reductions in the amount of
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoking that's actually going
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
on Nationwide correct that's correct
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
right so looking at people quitting or
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
or choosing other products that might
 
01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
not be taxed or not taxed the same way
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
um where where they choose to to
 
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
purchase their products obviously this
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
is a very fluid
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that um everything within
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
historical levels for
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
sure reduction of 3% what historically
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
happening before the uh methol
 
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
cigarette further questions of uh
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
Matthew Mr chair U if no one else does
 
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
can we just touch on the uh Highway fund
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
for a minute on the
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
Roo uh hold on one
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
second we
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
have we we
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
can right after this discussion we're
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
going to be having the Implement on the
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
road to okay go ahead
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh maybe Matthew has something he can
 
01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
contribute go ahead represent br oh no I
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at the she what's the
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
next item after we throw over the budget
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
director oh well I'm asking for the
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
governor uh for the uh the governor's uh
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
rationale between the for their
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
to I mean obviously it's coming back you
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
have it coming back but again uh not
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
back to the uh 21 plan you have a page
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
number uh representative it's uh well
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
maybe Chris Jay can put it up uh it's
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the document with the uh
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
the last P or the second page um Chris
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
sh could probably put it up yeah I can
 
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
share my screen if the committee wants
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
me to do that oh yeah Chris I'm happy to
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
let you share as well um this is the
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
underlying analysis that we use to get
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
to our Revenue estimate um but Chris why
 
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't I stop sharing this and let you
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
share your screen just at least for a
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
moment for the committee to them and
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
then and then um after I get done Matt
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
you can put that up
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to go far into this because
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to be discussing this
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
later go ahead so now you should be
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
seeing um the highway funds the
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
comparison document so here's the
 
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.270 align:start position:0%
comparison document so here's the
governor's

01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
now one thing that um we did do when we
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
put this together or I did do as we put
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
this together there's in fiscal year 22
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's a transfer of $8.1 million I
 
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
remove that number from any totals
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
because it's just a one-time transfer of
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
General funds um that would have
 
01:50:42.189 --> 01:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise lapsed related to B uh Bridge
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
projects so these These are the
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates and if you want I
 
01:50:48.270 --> 01:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
can pull up the work sheeet that has the
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
information from on the agency as well
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
as the um
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's information and the
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
right but what I saw from that Matt is
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
that you don't see the road toll or the
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
gasoline tax uh returning to 21 plan
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
23 um did I say that right
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I would have to look back at the
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
specific plan um I I I don't have that
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but certainly can
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
can pull it
 
01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.310 align:start position:0%
can pull it
um

01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
worksheet yes I I do see that Chris and
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
so looking
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
at official plan of 27 for fy20 yes so
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
represented that that would be accurate
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
um we aren't even projecting to to get
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
back to that level by FY
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
23 when you look at the 2020 plan a more
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate then right which I
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
say I would kind of concur with actually
 
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.270 align:start position:0%
say I would kind of concur with actually
that

01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's that's going to take a while to
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
come back as
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
well amount of Miles travel by people
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
especially again it also was tied to
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
people not commuting either um if the
 
01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
model changes where more people work
 
01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
from home and it continues that way
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
after Co it will also be affected as
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
each year Goes On by the efficiency of
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
Vehicles you have anything else to say
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
on that Master sure I'm happy just to
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
talk through the methodology briefly and
 
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
I know we are coming up on 11 um but um
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
Matt do you want me to stop sharing so
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
you can your document up or do you want
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
me to just leave what I have here if you
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
could Chris I'm happy to to show the
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh briefly what what our
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
analysis looked like and and why it is a
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the department
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
of safety um I will say we we are right
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
in line with Department of Safety on all
 
01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:11.719 align:start position:0%
the other estimates relative to uh motor
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees or fines or or any other
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue um but when it comes
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund what we what our
 
01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
methodology was was to look at ual data
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and we've noticed that there's been a
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent 1% growth
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
rate rather than try to estimate how
 
01:53:35.709 --> 01:53:35.719 align:start position:0%
strong the recovery would be we looked
 
01:53:38.069 --> 01:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
at it and projected out to where we
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
would have been based on historical
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
Trends in fy21 22 and 23 without Co
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
right so applying a 1% growth factor
 
01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.310 align:start position:0%
right so applying a 1% growth factor
each

01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
year and then reducing the impact
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh by a factor of 92% to get to our
 
01:53:59.790 --> 01:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimate essentially saying that
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
we look at the Historical
 
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
growth um and then
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
determine based on variety of data um
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
how many fewer miles people would drive
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
and how much more efficient vehicles
 
01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
would be um I would say that well this
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
budget does
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
Infuse um Federal relief money for
 
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
highways or um lapses from House Bill
 
01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.390 align:start position:0%
highways or um lapses from House Bill
1817

01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
1817
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
um the long-term structural
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
challenges um do still remain um so
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
these were one-time injections in light
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
of Co um but this postco recovery um is
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
how we chose to get to our numbers uh as
 
01:54:45.159 --> 01:54:46.030 align:start position:0%
how we chose to get to our numbers uh as
a

01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
result I'm sure the department of safety
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
will have some more information there as
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
well later today great we don't have a
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
copy of this
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
right you do not that's Matt's document
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to to clean that up and
 
01:55:04.069 --> 01:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
share it for the committee as well um in
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
a more presentable
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
used represent
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
El thank you could you let us know what
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
um on how you picked the 8% loss that
 
01:55:26.639 --> 01:55:27.629 align:start position:0%
um on how you picked the 8% loss that
you

01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
did sure so we and this is an estimate
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
of course the same way a lot of other
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
things are um but we looked at uh
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
traffic patterns and Mobility analyses
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
um based on for example data that Google
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
collects on different types of activity
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh people commuting to work people going
 
01:55:51.069 --> 01:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
to the grocery store uh travel patterns
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and we do think that covid will will
 
01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%
continue to dampen that um based on some
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
of the trends that representative abami
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um so again the only
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
difference in our methodology is
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
compared to the Department of Safety we
 
01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
continued that historical growth pattern
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
and then reduced based on an impact of
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
covid where the department looked at
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
where we were in fiscal 20 and fiscal 21
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
extrapolated uh what would come back um
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
in a non-co world for 22 and 23 I think
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
both methodologies are equally as valid
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I know that those do produce slightly
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
different numbers based on uh where the
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
the final Revenue projections came out
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
um but again just two different ways to
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
look at a very complex problem that um
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
even the best experts uh don't fully
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
have their hands around just
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
yet thank you that sounds better
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
questions hey the timing is very
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
good happy to help uh Mr
 
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
chairman excellent
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
um if there's no further questions of
 
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
Matthew thank you very much that's been
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
very informative and you'll provide
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee with copies of the
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
highway all right Absolutely I'll work
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
with Chris to make sure that any of the
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
materials that I showed today do make it
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
to the full committee um as PDF copies
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
as well okay we're going to check a five
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.709 align:start position:0%

02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes do we have the members from the
 
02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:42.589 align:start position:0%
yes do we have the members from the
highway

02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
highway
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
department yes represent major they're
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the call you have Scott Brier from
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
the road toll um
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
Administration and um Steve LaVoy who's
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
great and they're both on the call ready
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
right I thought having the
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh him work so closely in Chris J so we
 
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
had so many documents in front of us was
 
02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.189 align:start position:0%
had so many documents in front of us was
enormously

02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
helpful the sharing in the
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
screen really makes it really I it it it
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
makes being on Zoom all the time really
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the counterveiling
 
02:04:02.549 --> 02:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh part of it is that having
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
those documents in front of us
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
simultaneously so very very helpful on
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
budgets might as well fig this type of
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
virtual meeting if we didn't weren't
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
able to work with the documents right it
 
02:04:19.119 --> 02:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
able to work with the documents right it
really

02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh very very helpful I know that um
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time for the people doing
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
the presentations and for our
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee's uh staff people but it's
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
very very helpful I wanted to thank uh
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
chisay for his efforts oh good we're
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
right on time now so Steve Lavoy and
 
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
Scott Brer are going to go over their
 
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
estimates for road toll miscellanous
 
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
highway uh good morning Mr chair members
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee Steve Lavoy director of
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
administration from the Department of
 
02:05:03.069 --> 02:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
Safety and as you mentioned Scott Brier
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
is with me today um so we were um um I
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
can share my screen uh we were told that
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
we'd be focusing exclusively on the road
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
toll and so I thought what we might do
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
is um just revisit the road toll
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
sections of the presentation that we
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
Prov provided um about a week and a half
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
ago um and then open it up for any
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions at that point um we were on
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
during the governor's budget director's
 
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
presentation so um um I expect we'll be
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
able to talk through some of the
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
differences that we have between our our
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
estimates um so if that works uh Mr
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
chair I I'll share my my screen now
 
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
chair I I'll share my my screen now
right

02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.390 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:57.030 align:start position:0%
all
right

02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
so our road to toll Revenue um
 
02:06:02.189 --> 02:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
projections as you as you can see this
 
02:06:02.199 --> 02:06:03.629 align:start position:0%
projections as you as you can see this
shows

02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
shows
 
02:06:06.669 --> 02:06:06.679 align:start position:0%
the the revenues that were collected the
 
02:06:10.589 --> 02:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
actuals from fy16 through fy20 and fy20
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
had a significant decline um and that
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
was due to covid our fy21 projection uh
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
is we're projecting to fall even further
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
to 114
 
02:06:21.719 --> 02:06:22.790 align:start position:0%
to 114
three

02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
million um and then we are projecting an
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
an increase um starting to recover but
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're projecting that recovery to be
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
relatively slow um we're projecting for
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
fy22 uh to collect
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
12.2 million and for 23 to collect
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
121.5 million I me as you can see that
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
amount is still less than what we
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
collected in
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
fy19 um but we do think once we start um
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
returning to whatever this new normal
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
volume is that we'll start seeing those
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
um slight increases we were we were
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
seeing uh increases of about 1% every
 
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
year up until covid hit um now keep in
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
mind that 1% increase in the in the uh
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
the highway fund that Revenue increase
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
does not correspond to um or or cover
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
the increases in expenditures that this
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
fund supports at both do and the
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety so that's what we
 
02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
keep talking about the structural
 
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
deficit that we have in the highway fund
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
um that that we continue to to struggle
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
with moving forward um but that being
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
said we we were able to make um Mak ends
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
meet for the most part through through a
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
lot of um cost-saving measures that
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
occurred both here and at dot um but
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
from a revenue perspective we're not
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
close to recovering our fy19 based on
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
our estimates the next slide really
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
shows where our assumptions come from
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
and this shows the decline in um
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
year-over-year Revenue collection um on
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis and what you see here is
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the start of the pandemic um we would
 
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
have some minor fluctuations monthly we
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
might be down 2% one month we might be
 
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
up 2% the other month and that's what
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here in January and
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
February um in fact we were flat in uh
 
02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
heading into March but then when Co hit
 
02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.559 align:start position:0%
um significant decline so at its worst
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
we were 36% less U year-over-year
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
monthly um uh throughout this this
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
period but then you'll see we had a
 
02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
steep increase in the summer months so
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's corresponding to our our May
 
02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
through our September even into October
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
period and that had to do with a lot of
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
individuals who because of travel
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions they weren't uh they
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
weren't vacationing out of state they
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
weren't flying um for for travel outside
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
of New England we had a lot of um of of
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts New England related
 
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
people coming into the state hiking
 
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
using our natural resources and so we
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
see we we really believe most of this
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
recovery is due to the travel and
 
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
tourism in the summer months uh because
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
then what you see is in the fall once
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
the good hiking season uh disappeared
 
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
people weren't on the Lakes you see a
 
02:09:21.549 --> 02:09:21.559 align:start position:0%
decline um uh that that happens again
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
now this also corresponds to you know
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
what we call the second wave when there
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
were additional infections as well and
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
so you're seeing how Co is really
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
driving the um uh the driving habits of
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
of of our um residents and our visitors
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
So based on our original estimates we
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
were looking at at really looking at the
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
information from the summer um we felt
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
that we would be landing at we would be
 
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
landing around the maybe 5% range so
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
when we would recover we weren't
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
expecting to recover more than 5% of our
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
fy19 our preco revenues and that that's
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
what our new Baseline would be uh then
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
with the second surge that came forward
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
and kind of some additional analysis we
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
didn't feel comfortable that 5% was the
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
right number and we brought that down
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
even farther and so as you can see we're
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
projecting out to end fiscal year 21 um
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
in June at 8% monthly less than
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
fy19 we then took that figure and just
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
carried that forward for fy22 and FY 23
 
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
just assuming that we would have an 8%
 
02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
decline for 22 and then that would
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
increase with our 1% annual increase
 
02:10:43.229 --> 02:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in the past to a 7%
 
02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
decline from um fy19 amounts uh in FY 23
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that's where how we developed our um
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
20 million uh dollar estimate for 22 and
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
our $121 million estimate for for
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
23 um as as as Matt Meo mentioned um the
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
governor's approach was a little bit
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
different so so they um they took an
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
approach looking at what would we have
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
been if the pandemic had not existed if
 
02:11:17.549 --> 02:11:17.559 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the covid reductions and
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
then worked on their worked their
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
estimate back down from there using
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions related to um what would the
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
economic um recovery look like where
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
would that land so uh their their
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
projections are are are higher than ours
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
um but still well within the range of of
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
reasonableness as far as we're concerned
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's really just a different approach
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
and a different way to look at um that
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
those variables that
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't really have any
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
good information on so we're we're
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
trying to apply our judgment and our
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
best information that we have to come up
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
with what type of traffic volume can we
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
expect in 22 and 23 um and uh that's
 
02:12:03.149 --> 02:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
that's really what what the discussion
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
Point um around our numbers needs to be
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
around um and so with that I think um
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to open it up for any
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions that um that the committee
 
02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:16.149 align:start position:0%
questions that um that the committee
might

02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
have in the these
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
graphs and the hand out we received from
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety when they came
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
in to tell talk about their
 
02:12:29.639 --> 02:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
in to tell talk about their
revenue

02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
history and that was
 
02:12:38.549 --> 02:12:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
January questions from the committee
 
02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.669 align:start position:0%
January questions from the committee
representative

02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
Bry thank you Mr chair U thank you for
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
your presentation um there's normal
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
seasonality correct um and is in the
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
packet I can't recall is there a chart
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
of a normal normal Peaks and valleys be
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
by month uh without covid you know March
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
would probably be less than uh July you
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
know what I mean yeah we didn't we
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
didn't show the normal um fluctuations
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
um compared to the covid
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
amounts okay but you do have t you do
 
02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
have charts to that effect Alo right
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere yes we have we have the data
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
we could we could prepare that okay
 
02:13:26.559 --> 02:13:27.790 align:start position:0%
we could we could prepare that okay
thank

02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:13:30.910 --> 02:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
you fine if you send that to us it be
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
repres oh I didn't hear you say my
 
02:13:51.629 --> 02:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
name sorry um I'm having a lot of
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
trouble seeing these screens their their
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
charts are too small and the charts of
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
the budget director were too bright uh
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
but on I did want to ask uh Mr Lavoy if
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
they if the governor it sounded like the
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director got a hold of
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
surveys of uh how much traffic on was
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
generated by going to the grocer restore
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
versus commuting versus other things on
 
02:14:28.990 --> 02:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
and use that to reach his 8% reduction
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if he shared those
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
charts with you or because I know that
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
you were operating partly on the idea
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
okay there's going to be less commuting
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to um be maybe more local
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
trips so thank
 
02:14:49.629 --> 02:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
you yeah um I I did not see any of any
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
of the specific data that that he
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
utilized um I did have some discussions
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
with him and anecdotally kind of had
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
those discussions um to see what are you
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
seeing what information um how does that
 
02:15:04.750 --> 02:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
influence where where you're headed
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
versus how is it influencing where where
 
02:15:08.910 --> 02:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
we are with our so we did have some
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
discussions but I didn't see the uh the
 
02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.559 --> 02:15:19.229 align:start position:0%
 
projections

02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
projections
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
represent okay thank you
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
um so this is a question about uh moving
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
towards more efficient vehicles and uh
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
electric cars
 
02:15:35.549 --> 02:15:35.559 align:start position:0%
electric uh driven cars whatever the
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
right word is um and uh the movement in
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
that direction I know I know you've been
 
02:15:42.189 --> 02:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
wrestling with this over time and trying
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
to guesstimate estimate uh the decline
 
02:15:49.870 --> 02:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
in in Road toe Revenue because of this
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
um and and so I'd like you to update us
 
02:15:53.679 --> 02:15:54.709 align:start position:0%
um and and so I'd like you to update us
on

02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
how how that factors in um as you do
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
your estimating I think the governor's
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
budget director mentioned this this uh
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
variable but didn't go into it and uh
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know what you're you're
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing with this sure
 
02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
so like you mentioned the challenge is
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
determining predict
 
02:16:24.189 --> 02:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
what the future impact will be um
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
because obviously we don't want to
 
02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:30.559 align:start position:0%
underestimate and and um result in in
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
reductions to state budget expenditures
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
but we also don't want to overestimate
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
and fund programs that we can't follow
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
through with in the next several years
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
so the challenge that we've faced is we
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
don't really have any good data as far
 
02:16:46.589 --> 02:16:46.599 align:start position:0%
as adoption rates how many people are
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
intending to move to electron electric
 
02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles um from internal combustion we
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
we have there there's National Data and
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of adoption in certain
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
parts of the country um where where you
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
where you see a transition occurring um
 
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have as as much as robust
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
adoption here in New Hampshire and
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
there's several reasons that we've
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
identified as to why that might be um
 
02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
One is because we're a rural State and
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
many of us um who don't live directly
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
within one of the major cities have we
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
have to travel um to get through the
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
grocery store to get to basic services
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
in our towns and our communities and so
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
the idea of range anxiety how far will
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
my battery last before I need to
 
02:17:35.469 --> 02:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
recharge I think it I think it it means
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
more here in New Hampshire than maybe in
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
some other areas um that are more urban
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
that are more developed um we also well
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
the electric infrastructure is building
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
um it is being created it's it's not
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
there yet um so that's another pie that
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
adds to that if I can charge my vehicle
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
at home however how far can I go can I
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
do I have enough charge to if I live in
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
the Southern Tier if I live in NASA can
 
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
I drive up to Lon mountain and back on a
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
single charge can I drive up to
 
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
Burlington Vermont and back on a single
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
charge um if not where can I stop and
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
charge my vehicle so those those that
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure hasn't been fully
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
developed yet and still has a long ways
 
02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
um in the state there's been mentions in
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
the paper in the in the Press recently
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
of some areas um you know some companies
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
adopting plans to CH to transition their
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
Fleet to electric vehicles I think
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going to see the
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
biggest um the biggest impact on our
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
road toll is when fleets start moving
 
02:18:46.110 --> 02:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
because that's really G to um have a
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a large impact quickly um even if
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
the public adoption is slower
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
um if if fleet vehicles start going
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
electric then we're going to see a
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
significant decline in uh gasoline usage
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
but even even with those announcements
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
most of those are talking about
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
2035 um there it's it's several years
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
out maybe maybe by 2030 they'll have a
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
fully electric Fleet so taking all of
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
that uncertainty and um we we decided
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have enough information
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
to pin a number or a percentage and say
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
this amount is going to decline by for
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
because of road toll uh because of
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles so instead we looked
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
backwards and said well we've seen a 1%
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
increase over the last several years
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
excluding covid excluding 20 and 21 and
 
02:19:39.469 --> 02:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that the rate of adoption
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
will continue at those levels the early
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
adopters have adopted and will likely
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
continue to buy electric vehicles there
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
will be some increase in the public but
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're not expecting a SE change in the
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
next two years in the next five years
 
02:19:55.630 --> 02:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
there it's likely a different story so
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the next five years we're going to
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
have to keep looking at this and see
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
where we'll be in the next next Bion but
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
for now that that was what our approach
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
was we've already built that into our
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
estimate by looking at our previous um
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
actual Collections and using that figure
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
and carrying that forward that 1%
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
increase flag path forward into the
 
02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:17.469 align:start position:0%
increase flag path forward into the
future

02:20:17.469 --> 02:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
years I think that's a very good
 
02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:34.750 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
sorry uh the Volkswagen settlement was
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be partially spent on
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
electric charging stations were they
 
02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
electric charging stations were they
ever

02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
ever
 
02:20:49.389 --> 02:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
buil that was a state yeah I believe
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
that is with the office of strategic
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
initiatives um I believe they handled
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
the Volkswagen settlement funding um I I
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
had heard that I know that there were
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
plans being developed but I don't know
 
02:21:07.230 --> 02:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
what the status of that project was
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
Steve yes um I believe uh I believe that
 
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
there was a bill introduced that's uh
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
pending in committee to deal with that
 
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:21.190 align:start position:0%
pending in committee to deal with that
um

02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
but I don't know what the status of that
 
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
bill is but I do I am aware there is
 
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to look at that but the
 
02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
money hasn't been uh that has not been
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
time thank
you

02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
Murphy uh thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
question is a general one but also
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
involves Department of um safety in the
 
02:21:49.710 --> 02:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
toll tax so much of these uh Revenue
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
estimates seem to be
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward but there are
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
a few that are very very covid sensitive
 
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
so meals in room and tolls and travel
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
Etc and my question is do you or other
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
agency leaders have direct conversations
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
with folks like Dr Chan or others to get
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
a an inside look as to what their
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts are and predictions relative
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
to um these predictions that we're
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
making such as you know vaccine
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
availability variant Etc I'm just
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have had any direct
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with those in the medical
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
community to help with your um your
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
predictions um thank you for the
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
question I haven't had any direct
 
02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
conversations myself um I have been
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
following the vaccine distribution plan
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
the roll out um I I I think that there's
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
been a lot of good the public
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
information that's been made available
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan press conferences um so so I
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
have been following that progress and
 
02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely part of our our
 
02:22:58.990 --> 02:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
consideration but we haven't had any any
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
specific discussions about how would
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
that pertain to our um our our road toll
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
projections we've just utilized the
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
publicly available information as part
 
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
of our assessment okay thank you and let
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
me follow up on that um repr
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
Murphy this afternoon I should be
 
02:23:21.550 --> 02:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
getting the telephone number the
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
02:23:25.870 --> 02:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
HHS because Chris has been trying to get
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from HHS to come and talk to us
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
about about this and we haven't been
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
having any luck so right that was the
 
02:23:38.110 --> 02:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
reason I ask the question is that we've
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
been making predictions it seems heavily
 
02:23:44.670 --> 02:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
Laden with the covid overlap and without
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of real direction from them so
 
02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
that'll be helpful so I'll be going
 
02:23:52.670 --> 02:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
directly to the Comm Commissioner of
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
HHS um representative
 
02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
set thank you Mr chairman just a kind of
 
02:24:02.269 --> 02:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
a question slash comment uh Mr Lavoy
 
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
stated that um their uh Fleet company
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
fleets that are planning on being all
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
electric by a date certain uh the date
 
02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
of uh 2035 has been thrown around but
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
more importantly there are manufacturers
 
02:24:20.429 --> 02:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
like GM who have said that they're uh
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
their product lines are going to be all
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
electric now I don't suspect that um
 
02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to flip a switch in 2035
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be uh buying all
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles I believe there's
 
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a transitional period And
 
02:24:35.469 --> 02:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that maybe should be uh
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
we should address a little more
 
02:24:41.309 --> 02:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
proactively um because it it will affect
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'd rather uh be thinking ahead of the
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh curve here on this one uh because
 
02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's the reality we're going to be
 
02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
seeing more of these vehicles as the uh
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
months and years go by it's going to
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
step up quickly I
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
think and it isn't just electric
 
02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles it's hybrid vehicles and high
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency gasoline vehicles they're all
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
getting better each year and I think it
 
02:25:13.230 --> 02:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
was just uh Ford and general mortors
 
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
that come out said that by 1930 I guess
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be switching over to
 
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles that's not too far
 
02:25:27.269 --> 02:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
that further questions of uh Steve
 
02:25:36.429 --> 02:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
Lavoy if not and Scott
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
Brier do you have any um bring us up to
 
02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.269 --> 02:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else to oh I'm
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry Mr chairman um I
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
basically um agree with what's been
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
stated by Steve um I think that our our
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
numbers are uh we looked at one way
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
arriving at our numbers and uh the
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
governor's office looked at another uh
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
both those uh both those variables are
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable it's just like the approach
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
that each each of us choose to arrive at
 
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
our numbers but like right now um I
 
02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change any of uh I mean I think
 
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
both methodologies are reasonable but I
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
would stick with uh the numbers that we
 
02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
would stick with uh the numbers that we
have

02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's study done last
 
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
year paid for by the federal government
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
I think was about
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to look
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
at uh the road
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
to as part of it uh yeah vehicle became
 
02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
more efficient have
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
you been making use of this
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
study um some of the comments that Steve
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
made like for example uh where we live
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
like we're not uh some of the states
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
have obviously have more urban areas uh
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I mean if you look at
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh in Nashville and
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester they they do have electric
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
charging stations and so forth but the
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
whole issue is until you get an
 
02:27:24.269 --> 02:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for example that runs up
 
02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
the whole length of the interstate up 93
 
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
and 89 I think that the electric cars in
 
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
our state are going to be very limited
 
02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
until that infrastructure is built and
 
02:27:36.990 --> 02:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
based on the data that I've seen I I
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
think we're at least four five at least
 
02:27:41.550 --> 02:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
five years away from having the
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would really affect
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
us switching over to uh alternative fuel
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
source such as electric and I think that
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh the gasoline and Diesel's here for at
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
least five more years and I don't think
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any significant
 
02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
impacts uh other than uh yeah I mean to
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
be minimal but I don't see any
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
significant impacts that would affect
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
our Revenue estimates okay this study
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
was done for New
 
02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the report is out and I
 
02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:15.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the report is out and I
was

02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
wondering did that
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
report have any information that helps
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
you in
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
be I I think um I I didn't think there
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
was enough in there to use for
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
projections I think it was a more kind
 
02:28:39.070 --> 02:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
of um I Steve you want to comment on
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
that a little but I I didn't think it
 
02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
would really gave us anything specific
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
that we could say this is how it's going
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
to affect Road
 
02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
pool yeah so that that that report is um
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
is extremely useful it's I know it's
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
posted on the dot website and it was
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
really designed to take a look at
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle mileage use um and and what that
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
would look like with um moving forward
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
if there were a um a change in our in
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
our fee structure so that there were
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
some underlying assumptions that were
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
used um to develop their estimates and
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
we've looked at those
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
um we haven't
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
directly uh uh applied them in our
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
analysis but we've looked at that report
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and we revisit that to help
 
02:29:34.269 --> 02:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
influence our the decisions that we make
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
related to our um our our estimates and
 
02:29:39.630 --> 02:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
the variables that we're focused on um
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
but that that analysis was specifically
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
looking at a
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
um um a road usage fee uh and how much
 
02:29:52.349 --> 02:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh of that would would be required to
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
offset the loss in Revenue um based on
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
again they're using certain assumptions
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
related to the adoption of electric
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles replacing internal combustion
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
engines gasoline engines so um so yes we
 
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
have it we've looked at it but it's not
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
directly a plug-and playay type of a of
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
of an
 
02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
analysis thank
 
02:30:20.190 --> 02:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
you anything else that you uh want to
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
share with the committee any questions
 
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee on the road
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
to I I don't have anything else to share
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
but you know I'll take questions if
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
02:30:38.269 --> 02:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.309 --> 02:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
questions 10 none ready up thank you
 
02:30:41.319 --> 02:30:42.150 align:start position:0%
questions 10 none ready up thank you
very

02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you and for the
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee those graphs are in the
 
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
document we were given on January 27th
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
when they came came in and did the
 
02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:04.630 align:start position:0%
when they came came in and did the
highway

02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.389 --> 02:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
Pro Chris do we have anything else
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
morning uh you do
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
not okay that was the only thing um
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
after the governor's budget director was
 
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
to have Steve and Scott talk to you
 
02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
toll so next
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we'll be meeting to do uh
 
02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:35.150 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we'll be meeting to do uh
Revenue

02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
estimates so in between now and next
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday you want to look at these you
 
02:31:44.349 --> 02:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
Susan you'll probably have a uh Caucus
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with your
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
caucus and I'll try to have a Caucus
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.870 --> 02:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
when we get together on Tuesday we hope
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to finalize a graph numbers
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
for our Revenue estimates so we can have
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
these available to
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
either give them to the finance
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
chairman or do a house
 
02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
resolution before the Full House on the
 
02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
25th and we'll make that
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
decision depending on how well we do on
 
02:32:30.269 --> 02:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
estimat Mr chairman so we're not going
 
02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
to have any uh opportunity together
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
until Tuesday to
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
um take a first stab at
 
02:32:50.429 --> 02:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
numbers um
 
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
no this is
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
either caucuses or or other
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
then we may we may want to have a caucus
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
or would you want to have a a separate
 
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
work session on Monday it's it's
 
02:33:23.950 --> 02:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
actually it's not advertised in the
 
02:33:27.070 --> 02:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
calendar so we will do a work session on
 
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
all day Tuesday we'll have the Dr and
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
other agency heads there so we can
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessary so do your homework
 
02:33:47.269 --> 02:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
now and Tuesday and be prepared to come
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
your estimates for each every one of
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
these Revenue estimates and then we'll
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
discuss it and then we'll take a
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
vote question could I just then ask um
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
the Democrats if um I assumed we were
 
02:34:09.269 --> 02:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
going all day if uh at least some of
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
them could come together this afternoon
 
02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
to work on this because we only have an
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
hour and a half on Saturday we have to
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.269 --> 02:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon I have to do early afternoon I
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a 2:30 hard
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
stop I also have
 
02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
2:30 I can be the early afternoon
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
to okay so I
 
02:34:47.070 --> 02:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
cannot I I have an elderly friend that
 
02:34:50.429 --> 02:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
fell yesterday in um herb out person and
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
I've been yeah so she might have surgery
 
02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
this afternoon need my approval and yeah
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
well could I just ask uh the Democrats
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
that can to come at come at 12:30 to our
 
02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:06.870 align:start position:0%
that can to come at come at 12:30 to our
caucus

02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
room and um we'll try to go through to
 
02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
2:30 and see what we can can talk about
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
because we've got a number of new people
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
they haven't been through this before
 
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you we send out Zoom or some
 
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
connection on it would be Amanda Amanda
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
can you do that yep I'll resend it it's
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
the same link we've been using but I'll

afternoon or 10:00 tomorrow
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
morning 3:00 this afternoon with would
 
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
be better for me uh chairman major this
 
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
is hersel okay and I would agree with
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
that this afternoon would be better I
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's snowing out already so what
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
the heck a heck yeah I can do either so
 
02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not available Friday but today would
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
be great would be better good I'll send
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
you out a link for three o'clock this
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon for
 
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
caucus represent major can I uh s um out
 
02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that we two last term last ter
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
when we did this I think and Susan uh
 
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong didn't didn't
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
the Republicans and not to make this a
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
partisan thing because it isn't it
 
02:36:33.389 --> 02:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
really isn't I I think when we come up
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
with our estimates there's 24 of us so
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna go through Pat
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
what do you think you know you know
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
Allan what do you think you know you
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
know what we did last time is that we we
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
we got we went through that process with
 
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
our caucus and we we came up with a
 
02:36:54.910 --> 02:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
republican number and then the Democrats
 
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
came up with a Democrat number so that
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
when we we sat down with business taxes
 
02:37:03.309 --> 02:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
that we we had two numbers that we were
 
02:37:05.630 --> 02:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
working with and then we we kind of
 
02:37:08.269 --> 02:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
talked about why we came up with our our
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
number versus having 24 numbers now we
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
could all all throw in a number and
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
divide by
 
02:37:17.070 --> 02:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
24 that's fine with me I'm just trying
 
02:37:18.309 --> 02:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
to understand what the methodology is
 
02:37:20.269 --> 02:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
going to be we had a r
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh if if yeah if I could just
 
02:37:28.030 --> 02:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
eventually yeah if I could just uh
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
clarify on our side at least on when we
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
did that um we had a number but then we
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
had a couple of people on either ends of
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
talk as I recall um that so it wasn't
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't we had ranges if I remember no
 
02:37:54.750 --> 02:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
that was the summer I'm thinking of the
 
02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
that was the summer I'm thinking of the
summer

02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
summer
 
02:37:58.750 --> 02:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
sorry we're going to have essentially
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing do those in our
 
02:38:05.550 --> 02:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
individual caucuses and then we'll get
 
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
together right and we did listen to each
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
other as I recall at least a lot once we
 
02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
got together and people had individual
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
things that they threw in but we started
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
as you said from right
 
02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
from numbers that we would work our way
 
02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
off of or
 
02:38:27.550 --> 02:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
onto and just make it a little more
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
efficient on
 
02:38:32.429 --> 02:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
Tuesday instead of having 24 different
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
opinions uh we'll never get to the end
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so I mean we could just say you know
 
02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think and we could divide by
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
24 no one extreme but we've never done
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
it that way it's basically whoever
 
02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
speaks up um you know we want everybody
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
to speak up too so it's still easy to do
 
02:38:54.990 --> 02:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
that in your caucus um and then come the
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
consensus there when we meet on Tuesday
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
I'll ask let's say there's two or three
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
they talking fine let them talk we'll
 
02:39:09.150 --> 02:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
cut it off and then go through each and
 
02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:10.190 align:start position:0%
cut it off and then go through each and
every

02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:39:16.269 --> 02:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
one and where do you land on this and
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
why well we have like seven or eight
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
revenue streams left
 
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
and that's that'll be three votes on
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
each one of them um right I mean that's
 
02:39:28.990 --> 02:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
this year the next two years uh Revenue
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
estimates so we got a bit of work to do
 
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
we we dealt with all the easy ones these
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
are the more difficult
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
ones um that's why we need to start it
 
02:39:43.950 --> 02:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
right now and be ready for Tuesday right
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
and our estimates are on the law
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
today yeah
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
our our estimates don't take into
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
account I just thought you want to
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
remind people of that if we come out on
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
Tuesday uh we can't agree on a number
 
02:40:09.070 --> 02:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine what we'll
 
02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
do depends on which ones
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
it it's a
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
major your stream or not then we will
 
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
split it and probably won't come out
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
with a resolution it'll be a draft
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee once we agree on a number then
 
02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
way so that's
 
02:40:47.790 --> 02:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
why we're not going to make that final
 
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
decision on a resolution until we see
 
02:40:54.990 --> 02:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:57.790 --> 02:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday because the finance committee
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.309 --> 02:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
working no my hands I'm lowering my
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
hand any questions F questions yeah just
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh Susan what time do you want to start
 
02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
02:41:23.309 --> 02:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
well I said 12:30 assuming that we were
 
02:41:26.429 --> 02:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
going to quit at 11:30 but it's now
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
quarter 12 so maybe quarter to
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
one okay that's fine unless
 
02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:37.190 align:start position:0%
