bills
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
also i'd like to take a moment talk
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
about some of the
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
requests the senate messages which we've
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
had come in from the senate
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
this committee's been loaded with them
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
we had 15 bills come in
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
um that were to respond to and you've
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
gotten emails from me
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
where we are we have uh we're concurring
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
with 11 of them
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
and then there's four of which we are
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
not going to concur with that are going
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
to go to a committee a conference
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh the reasons why we have committee at
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
conferences going on is that the
 
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
conferences going on is that the
the

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
party on the other side of the wall is
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know making christmas trees out of
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
our our bills
 
00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
our our bills
and

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
even though many of the folks over there
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
have said we we didn't want to do it
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
some have so we have omnibus type bills
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are coming out of 1661 specifically
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
is one of those bills it was our career
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
technical education bill as you recall
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about the
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
competencies we're talking about the
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
calendar alignment between
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
all the districts within a regional
 
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.550 align:start position:0%
all the districts within a regional
area

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
that bill has been added with bail
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
reform with health and human services
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
with workforce housing with
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant etc
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
and so there's a lot added on to that
 
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
and so there's a lot added on to that
and

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
and
it

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
presents a lot of confusion as to how
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
and where how we're going to
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
work here
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
so on on that side and that is the the
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill that is primarily of concern to us
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's been added with the most most
 
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
that's been added with the most most
legislation

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
today though what we want to do is
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
get ourselves organized in terms of
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
where we're going with the interim
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
studies and i've had a lot of
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
communication from folks here in the
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee as far as which bills you'd
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
like to serve on and what i'd like to do
 
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.629 align:start position:0%
like to serve on and what i'd like to do
today

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
sort of walk through that get ourselves
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
organized find out who would like to be
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
on bills there may be some bills that
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're saying it we can just take care of
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
it with one session perhaps towards late
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
latter part of the fall
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
as you know that we can work on these
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills through the month of june
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
we cannot do so in july and august
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's sacred time where nobody comes
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
into here unless it's some other type of
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
statutory committee which is meeting for
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
some other purpose
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh so we'd have to pick it back up in in
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
september october and get things
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
concluded there as reports have to be
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
back out
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
and and uh action taken by us the action
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
is either it's either up or it's down or
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's up with some recommendations and
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we have the ability to do
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of issues which
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
we addressed
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
this year which i feel that there's a
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunity for us to make some
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
solid recommendations now and have
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislation come forward in the next
 
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.069 align:start position:0%
legislation come forward in the next
biennium

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes i don't know if we have any students
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
with us or girl scouts
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
no do we
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
oh there's some hands up there could you
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
explain some of the terms
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
of conference and all that
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's an educational there's a whole
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
process and will at which a bill becomes
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
a law
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
and any legislator sitting on the table
 
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
and any legislator sitting on the table
here

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
in the november when you first get
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
elected can put forth legislation
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
and that legislation's worked with
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
people over in what we call the office
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
of legislative services where there's
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys over there help us craft this
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
legislation in legalese so it's crafted
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
in a way that it doesn't conflict
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully with other areas of statute
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
already in print
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
once that gets done the the bill which
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
was or the legislation put forth let's
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
say by representative nelson here
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
would come forth as a legislative
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
service request lsr
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
that lsr then other legislators look at
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
it and decide i'm going to sign on to
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
that or not sign on it and be a
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor when that's all said and done
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's proposed and sent to the house to
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house that's the
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
person who's elected to maintain order
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
within our house and represent all of us
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
then the bill is taken and put forth to
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
a particular committee we have a number
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
of statutory committees you're in one
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
today which is education there's health
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
and your services there's agriculture
 
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.910 align:start position:0%
and your services there's agriculture
there's

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh natural resources on the other side
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
in the senate uh how many committees do
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
we have about 20
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
23 or so committees
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
and it can go anywhere from uh
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services to criminal
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
justice to judiciary affairs so once
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's assigned in the committee then the
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee then has to hear that bill
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
so it's brought forth by the sponsor of
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
the bill it's heard and the bill then is
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the uh ownership of the committee the
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
committee then has to have hearing on
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
that bill and then we after we've had an
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the public give
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
input whether they're for or against or
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
in between somewhere
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
or with recommendations how maybe to
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
improve it it's we exec the bill that
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
means we take action on the bill we can
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
either approve the bill
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
or we can not approve the bill give it
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
an itl or we can retain the bill in the
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
first year of the biennium
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're in the second year we have
 
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.629 align:start position:0%
we're in the second year we have
retained

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
15 i believe it's 15 bills for interim
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
study that means where they weren't
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
quite ready but they may be ready after
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
we work on it more once the bill is
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
approved by the committee it's sent back
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
to the house floor for action by the
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
whole body all 400 representatives take
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
action on it following that the bill may
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
go to a second committee if there's a
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
financial note attached to it or if
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
their way we're looking for where we're
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
going to get the funding to support that
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
bill we'd send it to ways and means
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
comes back to the house floor again it
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
takes action and it's on its way to the
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
senate and it repeats that whole cycle
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
they have their hearings they exec the
 
00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
they have their hearings they exec the
bill

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
when they modify it
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
then the bill is then sent back to the
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
house and we look at what they modified
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
amended and if we concur
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
with that modification we're basically
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
saying we concur it's ready now to go on
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
to the governor's desk
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
if we non-concur
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
and request a committee conference and
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's where we are right now we're
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
receiving a lot of those house bills
 
00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
receiving a lot of those house bills
back

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we had in this committee alone 116
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
bills this year and there are well over
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
a thousand bills in the legislature all
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
to get in the general court
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
so those that have made it through where
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're amended now are going back and
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
forth for committees of conference
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
and this is what we call the crazy time
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
when we're all trying to figure out
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
where we're going to go with these bills
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
and how we're going to do it
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
some people have we may have a bill in
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
there which we love like the career
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
technical education bill to improve
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
pathways for students to
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
obtain a certificate in a skill area
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
however they attach to it all this other
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
stuff all these amendments which are so
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
different than education
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned workforce housing
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning
 
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.070 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning
issues

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
health and human service issues medicaid
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
issues how all those are attached to
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
that particular bill i just mentioned
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
so now we have about a week in which we
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
gotta resolve that if we can resolve it
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
and come out with something that both
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
sides agree upon then it goes to the
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
governor for his attention
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a long process we're getting
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
close to the end it's uh may 26th is our
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
last day
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have to have everything done
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
everything done
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
on may 26th
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
except for the interim study bills which
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
we can work on through june so
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
any questions from those attending today
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is kind of an informal work session
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
i hope i've confused you huh
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
long drawn-out process it's not a simple
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
process but it is a good way to make
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure the public gets a opportunity to
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
get involved so back to where we are
 
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.590 align:start position:0%
get involved so back to where we are
here

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
we have these 15 bills right now which
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
we got to look at in terms of interim
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
study and they're all on the table where
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
their copies are on the table and we'll
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at them right now
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
we can either
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
have individual subcommittees dealing
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
with these or we can have committee of
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
there are several topics i've noticed
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of people suggesting
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
they'd like to be a participant in it
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
and maybe just wise to just have a
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee the whole as that committee
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
and for everybody to be a participant in
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind as we roll through
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
this uh dave do you have anything else
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
to add here at this time or or mel
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
some swedish with covered today that and
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
um can watch us
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
go through some of the more complex
 
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.830 align:start position:0%
go through some of the more complex
nuance

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
nuance
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it's um it's quite a process
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
so the the if i'm kind of looking at the
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
same sheet that i hope everybody else is
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
so the first one on top there's 11 37
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the duty of school
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
boards to provide education
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh i'll read what i have in the
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee report here this bill provides
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
more than the title provides more
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
research is needed for what is needed
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
for school board duties concerning
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
superintendents parents teachers etc in
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
the past few years issues have been
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.630 align:start position:0%
brought up
on

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
parental input student teaching etc this
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
interim study will allow us to research
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
existing laws rules policies and may
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
maybe suggest different laws and
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
regulations of how school boards conduct
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and what their duties are
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's open to discussion now from the
 
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.789 align:start position:0%
it's open to discussion now from the
committee

00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%

what what should be the goal of this
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
particular group if you look at that
 
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.909 align:start position:0%
particular group if you look at that
bill

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
eleven thirty second comments on them
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
well from the committee here you know in
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
other words i'm trying to get a
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
direction for the people are going to be
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
sure i mean i think the um the bill as
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
as glenn introduced it enumerates uh a
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
series of additional responsibilities
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
that school boards would have
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of those responsibilities
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.990 align:start position:0%
are are
are

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
things that that superintendents
 
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
things that that superintendents
generally

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
generally have but but of course
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
everything that the superintendent does
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
the school board's responsible for
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
as well but the school board doesn't
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
actually have to
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
um be the
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
board that does all of those things so i
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
think that's that's an important
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
distinction here
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
with how current law
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
says these are things that the school
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
board has to do
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
not necessarily um
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the superintendent can um
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know can do and uh and
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
and you know approve and uh
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
any other discussion do we need to have
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
a laundry list of duties in something
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
like this or can it be
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
local decision
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
those are questions i guess would be
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are four
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
rick that's one of the i think that's
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
one of the issues here yeah that is
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
how much do you legislate the list
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis that of
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
what should be the prerogative of the
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
local school board
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that's going to be the task
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
of this group
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
is trying to identify what the
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
parameters should be from a legislative
 
00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:57.830 align:start position:0%
parameters should be from a legislative
standpoint

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
not necessarily getting into
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
every item
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
that would then preclude
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
locals from doing a certain thing that
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
they may want to do that would be
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
outside what that list might be that's
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the challenge i believe in
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know i was when i've served on
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
school boards myself probably the the
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
big responsibility had was to develop an
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
annual budget
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that was it you know
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
primarily and of course we used to work
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
with the municipality as well
 
00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
with the municipality as well
taxes

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative porter do you have
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
i was just i see you thinking over there
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just saying working on that
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
annual budget i mean that's a huge thing
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
that they have to do
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
and if you make up a list of all these
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i feel pretty strongly about
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining as much local control as
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
possible with stuff like this
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
because sometimes the community doesn't
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
need what another one community doesn't
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
need what another community wants
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and i know when when we were in uh
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
when i was in municipal and county that
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
was one thing we
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
it didn't matter what party you belonged
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the idea was we don't make laws to
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
make one town happy that's going to make
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
every other town
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
have to do something that they've never
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
done before or don't need to do
 
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.390 align:start position:0%
done before or don't need to do
so

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
you know just a word of caution who's
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
ever working on this that you don't want
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
you don't want the hand of the thumb of
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
the state on local issues and schools
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
are local
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we have i have on the sheet here
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
four names which would
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
be on this if we have a subcommittee it
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
was uh president cordelli represent
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
hobson representative tanner and
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
represent hall of course represent
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
tanner's not here to object
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
no she yeah we had we had discussed this
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
okay um so if if um
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're good with that we'll go ahead with
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
that group working on that and you gotta
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
bring back some kind of recommendation
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
as to where we need to go with that
 
00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.029 align:start position:0%
as to where we need to go with that
okay

00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
relative to special education services
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
for children in charter public schools
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's kind of we had the mou bill
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
also there was a special education study
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
committee last fall that heard and
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
received much testimony this amended
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill addresses some of the issues raised
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
by parents
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
these include perceived intimidation and
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
individualized education plan iep
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
meetings by the presence of district
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers which can is contrary to federal
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
law concerning allowed
 
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.789 align:start position:0%
law concerning allowed
participants

00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
participants
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
there were also complaints about having
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
to sign non-disclosure agreements in
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
order to enter into mediation which also
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
is against federal law we also heard
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
testimony of incidents
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
where documents have been missing or
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
inaccurate in student files so an an
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill includes
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
provisions for parental access to
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
records issues remain however in looking
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
at existing administrative rules that
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
exceed state and federal law and what
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
statutory changes still are needed the
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
majority agreed that interim study was
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
the best way to continue looking at
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
do we still feel the same way we had
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
some discussion with the
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
the way it works or having that mou set
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
regarding kids which are in charter
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
schools to have an iep
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
as far as how's the sending district
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
or the resident district going to handle
 
00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.269 align:start position:0%
or the resident district going to handle
that

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
that program for that youngster
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
represent you've been involved with that
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
quite a bit i have and uh i i my
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
question i guess would be to
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli because it was
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
his amendment to this bill
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
that really sort of
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
put language behind all of the concerns
 
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.389 align:start position:0%
put language behind all of the concerns
and

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:13.350 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know my question to to you
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli would be
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
do you feel that the bulk of the issues
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
were addressed through
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation that went through
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
um i i guess
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
the two
 
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
the two
um

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
rick mentioned it in his uh
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh summary here um two main issues that
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
i was trying to get at
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
um that i i don't think did go through
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
legislation was
 
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:46.820 align:start position:0%
legislation was
the

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:46.830 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.710 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
participants in an iep meeting
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
the non-disclosure agreements
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think those were the the
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
two of the main areas that i was trying
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
to get at with the amendment
 
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.909 align:start position:0%
to get at with the amendment
um

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
i have to go back and look because i
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
think that one of those
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
areas the department did subsequently
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
put out a technical document technical
 
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.870 align:start position:0%
put out a technical document technical
advisory

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
on one of those areas but i have to go
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
back and read what i think it may have
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
been on the lawyer at the ie the
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
participant in the iep meeting yeah
 
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:28.870 align:start position:0%
participant in the iep meeting yeah
right

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i need to go back and
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
look at that
um

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.549 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think clearly from what we heard from
 
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.909 align:start position:0%
i think clearly from what we heard from
parents

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
over the past year or so
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
there were parents who
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
so rick yeah so thank you um so so i
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
guess back to i think the question that
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
you sort of put out there is um you know
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
would would would
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
some or all of the
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
aspects that 1141 was going after could
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
those be covered through the the mou
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
between a charter and a um yeah i think
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
that was senate bill 238
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
was it
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
mou bill i i don't i don't remember the
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill number on that
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
but but you know can the can a
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
combination of the mou
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um i mean now we also have the
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
office of the special education um
 
00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:29.269 align:start position:0%
office of the special education um
uh

00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
uh
advocate

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.909 align:start position:0%
advocate
uh

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know provide the the additional
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
supports that 1141 was trying to do
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
well i i
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's where i am with the advocate
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
will that help can we take care of it
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
administratively rather than having to
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
do it legislatively
 
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
do it legislatively
um

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would be my question uh to the
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee right now and and glenn you
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
you you're indicating that
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
what i um
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would not have a problem with waiting
 
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
i would not have a problem with waiting
and

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
seeing what the advocate
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
can do in this area and see
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
problems or complaints that
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
they might get on these two areas um
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
before doing anything more because um
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
much of this is uh already in federal
 
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.389 align:start position:0%
much of this is uh already in federal
statute

00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
we could possibly hold off
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
so so with that would it be fair to do
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
do an nr
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh pending um feedback from the um the
 
00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:40.789 align:start position:0%
uh pending um feedback from the um the
um

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
yeah i have no problem with that either
 
00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:50.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i have no problem with that either
yeah

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
we we had a study on this earlier that
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
you were on representative mullin and
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia myself along
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
with senator reagan
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
and then we've also gone with the
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
discussion with the advocate the child
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
advocate um
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
so i i personally would like to
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
wait and see how that you know works
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
and then and also together can i just
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
ask one question of you uh mr chairman
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
do you know anything about the
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
performance audit that is supposed to be
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
performance audit has not been completed
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
in fact it's just on the front side
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
performance artists take a long time um
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's done by the lba
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
um yes forever cordelia
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that there was
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh possibly last week a meeting of the
 
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.190 align:start position:0%
uh possibly last week a meeting of the
um

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh performance audit oversight committee
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i wrote senator reagan to see if
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
there was any update from that meeting
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
on this topic but i have
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
not heard back from them i i think maybe
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
the senate was a little busy last week
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
also so uh
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
i will follow up with senator reagan to
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
see if we can get an update
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
i've talked with senator reagan and he
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
told me he hadn't heard a thing
 
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.470 align:start position:0%
told me he hadn't heard a thing
back

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
so rick it would seem to me well to hold
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
on this period yeah i think that's where
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
we need to be on this i i don't think we
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
should put a subcommittee together or
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
even a committee a whole i think we
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
ought to just take action on this
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh in november you know up or down
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
and it looks seems to me that we want to
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
just hold off
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
and wait another year until this audit
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
would get done until we find out where
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
get some good information in from the
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we won't do anything with that
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
one the chair
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes i'm looking at an email that i
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
received from
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
representative weber
and

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
evidently that legislative performance
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
audit oversight committee is meeting
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
a lot going on
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is it's very busy out there so
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
we'll skip over 11 41 and we won't have
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
a committee we won't have a committee
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
the whole either we'll just wait and
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
take it up in november or october in
 
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
take it up in november or october in
october

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
october
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
everything here has to go before the the
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
whole general court though that's that's
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
the ultimate end of it here okay number
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
three here hb 1229
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study school
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
meal programs in new hampshire's public
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
schools and non-sectarian schools that
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
the education committee has been
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
approached this year with several bills
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
that request we study with foods
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
programs schools are using and what
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
programs are not working
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
we have been approached with bills that
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
want to explore how granite state
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
students can take advantage of our
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
natural resources and farms
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
that will benefit the students
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
nutritionally and our farmers
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
financially some questions revolve
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
around whether local resources can
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
alleviate supply chain issues
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
and whether we can rely on them
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
systematically for these reasons and
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
more we need to decide on a preliminary
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent mullet thank you um i
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
think you threatened me with uh leading
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee or this interim study
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee at one point mr chairman um
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
am i correct that this would be a study
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
com an interim study of whether or not
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a study
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
no i mean the bill was to establish a
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
study i i i got that but you know we had
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
some bills come forward like like the
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
one dealing with local produce
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
and can we sustain local produce
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire school year
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
would we have winters here and they
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't in florida so they can do such
 
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
don't in florida so they can do such
things

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
so i think it ought to be regarding the
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
entire nutrition program we have in our
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
schools breakfast program lunch program
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
what are the issues
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
are there needs for future legislation
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
if so what are those
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's potential in in this
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
topic here it's we certainly had i don't
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
know how many bills we had come forward
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes you also get into a financial issue
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
because i would think those items that
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
fresh food and everything will cost a
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
little more
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
i hope they you know local but i would
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
think local programs could cost
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
more than what you'd like for
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
supermarket or
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah this is something that we need to
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
watch commissioner jasper did come here
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
and testify in the committee
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
foods and marketing our marketing and
 
00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:42.230 align:start position:0%
foods and marketing our marketing and
foods

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
foods
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that was one of his concerns so it's
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate that we should be looking at
 
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
legitimate that we should be looking at
so

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
i would you know suggest that if we have
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
who would like to be on that committee
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%

um are there any other representatives
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%

she's not well
so

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to work on that
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're all willing to get in you know
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
involved with it
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
remember the committee itself has to
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
come forward with some kind of
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the body of the hole
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's a worthy topic
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
number four
 
00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
number four
1295

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
1295
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
requiring reports concerning school
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
policies and classroom recordings and in
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty hefty topic
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would require superintendents
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
to submit a report to the department of
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
education on school policies concerning
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
in classroom videos the committee
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
believes this bill needs more study to
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
i see he's upstairs right now
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
yes is it showing videos or somebody
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
he's coming in california in the next 10
 
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.829 align:start position:0%
he's coming in california in the next 10
days

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
um mr chair yes did we get a report from
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
the school boards association that there
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
were numerous
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
reports on this
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
well we've had legislation here before
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli sponsored that
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
and one year later we were back
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
revisiting it
 
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.829 align:start position:0%
revisiting it
um

00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
we got into a lot of confidentiality
 
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.109 align:start position:0%
we got into a lot of confidentiality
issues

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
special education issues
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
issues student teaching issues
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
on it went
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
and there is school board policy that as
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
a result of all that a boiler plate was
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
put forward
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
i thought we did a pretty thorough job
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
with that coming up with that as a
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
result of the stuff we ran into back
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
when glenn was you know dealing with us
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
two years in a row or maybe it was a
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
year in between i don't know
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
it was two years in a row we put it out
 
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
it was two years in a row we put it out
there

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we got trampled the next year until
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
we got that fixed by things that it
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
never came up during the public hearings
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative porter is the pub
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
the existing law does it deal with
 
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.190 align:start position:0%
the existing law does it deal with
um

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
students making videos with their phones
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
within the classroom
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
i mean that might be a change that's
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
occurred since that law was
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
written by
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know i don't know what
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
the statute is of cell phones in the
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
classroom is an issue in itself right
 
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:08.950 align:start position:0%
classroom is an issue in itself right
but

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
do does that does the statute now
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
require school districts to have
 
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.030 align:start position:0%
require school districts to have
policies

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.230 align:start position:0%
policies
concerning

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
the students use of their phone to
 
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.990 align:start position:0%
the students use of their phone to
videotape

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
videotape
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
what occurs in the classroom it's an
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
interesting point i don't know i don't
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
believe so
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'd address that going on
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
memory mr chair yes this is also dealing
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
with in-person classroom observers as
 
00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
with in-person classroom observers as
well

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
brett moffatt's not here i don't know if
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to be fighting for him well
 
00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to be fighting for him well
no

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah he did mention that that you
 
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.150 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah he did mention that that you
know

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
parents were according to what it was
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
coming across from mike is that they
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
were not being allowed into the
 
00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:58.069 align:start position:0%
were not being allowed into the
classroom

00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
porter i was just wondering what whether
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
that might have something to do with
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
student confidentiality especially where
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
special education is concerned
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
there are times when you don't want
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
parents in the classroom i.e when you're
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
giving statewide examinations
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
we had a policy
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
also with our younger students when we
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
talked about kindergarten one
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't want parents coming in at the
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
when the yes
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten teacher or the
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
preschool teacher was trying to get a
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
handle on things
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
mother saying this and teachers saying
 
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.550 align:start position:0%
mother saying this and teachers saying
that

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
was not a very good situation so there
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
are times where
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think that decision making has to be
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
up to the school
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh and and you can have pta pto ptc's
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
where you can work with and inform them
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
and i think through that process a
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
parent-teacher club or organization or
 
00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.150 align:start position:0%
parent-teacher club or organization or
association

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
they will understand and i've never had
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
one object and they understood that
 
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.150 align:start position:0%
one object and they understood that
policy

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
so um what do you think dave
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair is this similar to representing
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
material on gifted i mean if his intent
 
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
material on gifted i mean if his intent
here

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
is merely to collect what the policies
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's one thing because we don't know
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
what those policies are because
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
of all the many school districts we have
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
there are three a variety of different
 
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.550 align:start position:0%
there are three a variety of different
options

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
so if this is merely a fact of
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
having the superintendent submit the
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
report and send the the local policies
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
once those are done then you can begin
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
to look at what those policies are
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
because i don't know
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
what the intent of the law or what the
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
proposal is here other than to collect
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
the respective policies it doesn't say
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a policy it says collect the
 
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.069 align:start position:0%
have a policy it says collect the
policies

00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
policies
correct

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
i think that could also be used as a
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse a one-stop shop for uh for
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
spy on kids
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
or something like that or take take
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
other action you know
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if um
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
if the current statute
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
limits in person just to parents
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
could be any member of the public
 
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
could be any member of the public
and

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
allow building principles
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
to um to obviously
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
be able to you know protect the safety
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
and security of the students in their
 
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.750 align:start position:0%
and security of the students in their
care

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
so what do you think
 
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.630 align:start position:0%
so what do you think
sis

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
sis
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's a very difficult topic and you
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
can't compare one district to another
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
they're all different local school
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
boards run the show differently
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
and as an ex-principal
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
i always had parents check into the
 
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.430 align:start position:0%
i always had parents check into the
office

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
first when they came in what's your
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
purpose what you're here for that's our
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to know who's in the
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
building in case even if there's an
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
emergency a fire alarm goes off you
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
gotta know who's in your building
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of other issues go
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
well beyond that so
 
00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.309 align:start position:0%
well beyond that so
um

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
i think if somebody wants to pursue that
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
on their lonesome they can do that but
 
00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
on their lonesome they can do that but
to

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a whole study committee on it i
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:38.470 align:start position:0%
think we're
yeah

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
so if if representative moffat wants to
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
pursue this
 
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
pursue this
he's

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
got my blessing
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i you know personally i don't think
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's we got 15 bills here folks
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
which ones are really
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
top shelf and which ones are
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
maybe not on the shelf
 
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.630 align:start position:0%
maybe not on the shelf
yes

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
he he's
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
standing in for representative balducero
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
whereas al's not here and he's vice
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
well i think that
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.829 align:start position:0%
 
he's

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
if the if he's the only one that really
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
wants to pursue that
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
then he's welcome to do that we're not
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
saying no
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
let him do that you know there may be
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
some of something he knows that we don't
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
know right here now um
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
that he can work with his own community
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
on representative porter it's important
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
to remember too that our only
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming out of these
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
interim study committees is
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation or don't
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation so we only
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
have those two options
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
that you know so a lot of these topics
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
this gives us a chance to delve a little
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
more deeply in them into them but it
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
does not put any kind of
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility on future
 
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.190 align:start position:0%
responsibility on future
um

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislators to do something about it so
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
the only advantage to having a study
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
right now is like when we did in the
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
concussion bill years ago
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
after studying it and looking at it and
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
researching it and inviting people and
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
doing that we came up with some good
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah and
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
went forward and that can happen but it
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't come up end up with a bill and
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes the bill recommendation that
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
gets worked on
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it the next session anyway
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll leave that up to
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative moffat to move forward if
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
he so desires and
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
we will have to discuss it anyways in
 
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.270 align:start position:0%
we will have to discuss it anyways in
october

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay next one 1313
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
relative rights to freedom from
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination in higher education
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
the discrimination law passed last year
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
applied to k-12 but then did not
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
specifically identify post-secondary
 
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.870 align:start position:0%
specifically identify post-secondary
education

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
the bid bill did state that nothing in
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
that subsection of law shall be
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
construed to limit the academic freedom
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
of faculty members of the university
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire or the community
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
college system of new hampshire
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
to conduct research publish lecture or
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
teach in the academic setting however
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
been brought to the attention of
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee members that there may be need
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
for language with the law to address
 
00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:32.950 align:start position:0%
for language with the law to address
address

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
to also address curriculum and
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
instruction at the post-secondary levels
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
the committee prefers the option of
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
working closely with higher education
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
administration to obtain assurances that
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
policy in place ensuring that all
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
students know and experience the
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
community college system college and
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
university systems as welcoming and
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
inclusive place places to live work and
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
study the education committee recommends
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
interim study and is hopeful that by
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
working together we can build bridges
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
and models of inclusivity
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh without the need for further
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
legislation action by the general court
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think that just came out a blurb out
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee report
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's all these are so that's um
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
i can remember i was i believe the
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor that bill my feeling is right
 
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
sponsor that bill my feeling is right
now

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.670 align:start position:0%
now
that

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to work with
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
the two systems
 
00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:28.150 align:start position:0%
the two systems
and

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know right now if it's even
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
no i agree
 
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.430 align:start position:0%
no i agree
okay

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
so we're not going forward with that one
 
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.589 align:start position:0%
so we're not going forward with that one
okay

00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:48.549 align:start position:0%
okay
no

00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
the next one is one though i think that
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
we need to focus a little bit on here
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
um hb 1366
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
cooperative school reapportionment
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh this bill was submitted for the
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
purpose of making it easier to submit
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
petitioned articles locally with regard
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
to proposed cooperative school district
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
apportionment modifications
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
the rsa 195 colon 22 presently requires
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
such a proposal to show signatures of at
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
least 10 percent of cooperatives
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
districts qualified voters
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
this requirement is daunting
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
particularly in larger districts however
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
during the committee work
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
work it was all understood that
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
different different dynamics occur in
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
sb2 communities that need further consul
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
consideration before moving forward with
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:39.030 align:start position:0%
this legislation
reapportionment

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
reapportionment
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter so a couple of
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
things here number one there are a
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
number of bills that have to do with
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts that we
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
might clump together
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
and number two um
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
it was just noted that in the town of
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
croydon they needed to get half of their
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
registered voters to a meeting
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
and they got more than
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
half their registered voters to a
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
meeting um that's a pretty high standard
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
and certainly it was done when people
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
are um driven
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
by something important to do it so
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think 10 is unreasonable um
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's pretty low bar cons considering
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
what croydon just did
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
on that point rick you've got the
 
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.309 align:start position:0%
on that point rick you've got the
1399

00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
1399
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
yep and 1679.
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
why don't we just put those three those
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
three together i think that's what we
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
need to do and
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be that there
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's a number issues not just
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
reapportionment but election of of the
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
as we found out with the when we did
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
look at this cooperative school board
 
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.630 align:start position:0%
look at this cooperative school board
issue

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and how to elect folks we found that
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
some cooperatives
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're all 30 what two or three of them
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
are totally different from each other
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
some were formed in the 1960s
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
some have not really looked
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
in depth at how they're put
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
how things have changed within their
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
communities since those agreements
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
articulation agreements went into effect
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
and of course populations have changed
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
wealth of the community has changed on
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
i i think i'd like to see us combine the
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
three of them together and have a
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
just uh to look at that
 
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
just uh to look at that
the

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
the there was one issue that we had
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
looked at in potential
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh amending language was that
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
every 10 years we do a census here in
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.829 align:start position:0%
the state
um

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
is it worth our considering that every
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
you've got to look at these articulation
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
agreements and see if you're apportioned
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
properly in terms of representation from
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
that was one of the questions which came
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
up and i think it needs resolution
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative porter um that would also
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
require funding i would imagine
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't it wouldn't be
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
you would do
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
without an expert helping you
 
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.750 align:start position:0%
without an expert helping you
like

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting for the whole state we
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't do without being advised
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
by people who know how to do it
 
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.510 align:start position:0%
by people who know how to do it
so

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that it would be
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
something that would need to be budgeted
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
for so there would be some money
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
available for communities to do that
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
there again that be something that the
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee would look at and you know
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
want to discuss
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want to comment on that
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
right now but
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
any other representative cornell i i
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
don't understand that well being from
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
manchester because we don't have
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
anything like this but don't these
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
cooperative districts go in with a
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding when they
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
join and get together and
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
should it be us telling them what to do
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
with their
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
we we looked at that they have
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
articulation agreements when they first
 
00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
articulation agreements when they first
form

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
and those agreements then have to go on
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
and be approved by the state board of
 
00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:17.670 align:start position:0%
and be approved by the state board of
education

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh we found that
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
a number of districts
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
have different numbers on their boards
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
right now some have even numbers where
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
the initially it never spoke to whether
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
you should have an odd number and of
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
course that's a challenge when you're
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
having a vote
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
and we know the maximum number is 15 and
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
this the smallest number is three
 
00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.870 align:start position:0%
this the smallest number is three
members

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
but those articulation agreements like
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
the district that i'm in right now
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
i'm in a cooperative
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
the haverhill cooperative school
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
district is a cooperative district of
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
one town
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
i initially had two towns or two high
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
schools woodsville had a high school and
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
haverhill corner or haverhill had a high
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
school or academy
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the academy folded and and now they
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
have seven
 
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.109 align:start position:0%
have seven
at-large

00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
at-large
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh board members elected in the town of
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
haverhill and they're all representing
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the town of haverhill
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
um there's time for an overhaul of that
 
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.870 align:start position:0%
um there's time for an overhaul of that
agreement

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.470 align:start position:0%
agreement
um

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
and and that same thing is occurring in
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
some other districts not as much as that
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
but where we have a
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
districts that have
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
populations that have so shifted
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's out of whack it's
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
really out of whack and the
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
person coming out of that very small
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
district now really
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know other than being elected at
 
00:55:44.319 --> 00:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
you know other than being elected at
large

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
large
possibly

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
representation is not one man one vote
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
type representation
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's a huge issue
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
so rick
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
rick why don't um
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
as as i think representatives porter and
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
milor have suggested that and and you've
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole study
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
interim study on on basically relative
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
to cooperative schools
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
governance re i'm sorry governance
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
because that's the um withdrawal is the
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
subject of
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
1399 and dissolution is the subject of
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
1679. yes and so
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
and and uh board reapportionment is
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
everybody agree with that to take those
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
three bills and lump them into one study
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that as a committee of the
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
whole yeah great thank you
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
1373 relative to the best interest of
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
the child of the student for a change of
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
school or assignment that's manifest
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
education hardship
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have done this over and over and over
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
again glenn
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
where do you want to go on your bill
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
based on the new information we have
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
gotten um
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
during within the hearing process
 
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.030 align:start position:0%
during within the hearing process
um

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it requires at this
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
point a study committee um you know if
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
a member wants to look at it and get
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
involved they can always bring back
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislation but i don't think it
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
requires a study committee at this point
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
everybody concur in that
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
1399 we took care of that
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
with the cooperative school
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
14.99 is relative a charter school
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
public school eligibility for state
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
this is a topic that's going to keep
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
popping up at us not just this but
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
school building aid as a whole
 
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.549 align:start position:0%
school building aid as a whole
um

00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with the tail
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of debt we have which is over
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars or
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
we have to it was remember
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
570 580 million dollars years ago and
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay off that debt by year
 
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay off that debt by year
2040

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
2040
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're getting there
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
each year we appropriate 50 million
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
dollars for school building aid of which
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
out of that comes paying off the debt
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
which we call the tail
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
and that's over 30 million dollars so
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
that maybe leaves what 18 million
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
thereabouts for
 
00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
thereabouts for
for

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
renovation and new facilities
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't make it and we know
 
00:58:50.799 --> 00:58:51.829 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't make it and we know
that

00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
if you talk to amy clark over there at
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
the doe right now it's over what in
 
00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.390 align:start position:0%
the doe right now it's over what in
total

00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
monies needed for building that she has
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
her death 700 and something thousand
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
dollars of which you cut that down maybe
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
40 percent of it 45 of that and that's
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
what we'd have to appropriate
 
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.630 align:start position:0%
what we'd have to appropriate
um

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's just for school houses then the
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
career tech ed centers are coming up
 
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.069 align:start position:0%
career tech ed centers are coming up
and

00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
that schedule has is getting at the end
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
of that rotation and we're going to
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
start going forward again
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that's not a cheap thing capital
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
improvement project so we got that and
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
now we have this business with charter
 
00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:29.190 align:start position:0%
now we have this business with charter
schools

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
and the issue with charter schools is
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
how many charter schools own the
 
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.910 align:start position:0%
how many charter schools own the
buildings

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
or are they leased facilities and do we
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
i i think we should
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to come up again
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to know
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
are there any charter schools that
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
actually own their buildings now
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think they're like two or four yeah i
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
think so okay my concern is this is that
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
the state has already committed that
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to commit any more
 
01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.510 align:start position:0%
they're not going to commit any more
money

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
and so you are you know you have
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
a finite amount of money
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's already you've got people in the
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
so it seems you know if you want to
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
study fine but it just seems to me that
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
until the state
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
provides an adequate amount of money for
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
school funding why are you going to add
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
another category into this into this uh
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
chiseling this up with this piece of pie
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
here this piece of pie there i
 
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.589 align:start position:0%
here this piece of pie there i
mean

01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's no commitment on the state
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
to add more money to this and we've been
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
fighting this thing for 10 years
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
and regardless of what the
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
administration is
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
there doesn't seem to be a wherewithal
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
state to really want to put any more
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
money into this thing so why would we
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
add another category into this potential
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
just a question i have in my mind
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
would you see a
 
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.069 align:start position:0%
would you see a
process

01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
part of this study because we've heard
 
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.549 align:start position:0%
part of this study because we've heard
from

01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative hill who's the chair of
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
the school building authority
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
um about problems with the whole process
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
um and the need to you know look at the
 
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.990 align:start position:0%
um and the need to you know look at the
process

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
that they go through now in that uh
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
the authority
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh as i recall has to come up with
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
plans and recommendations not even
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
knowing whether the community
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know has voted to go ahead with any
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
kind of building project
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
so in
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
some ways it's the part before the horse
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
this whole process the when you talk
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
about the school building authority
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's a group that's made up of about
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
five people
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
a fire marshal's one then you have
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
people from dra in in department of
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
education commissioner
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
and it's the application for building
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
aid comes into doe they look at it they
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
try to prioritize these
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
they make sure they're complete
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
and then they send it on to the school
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
building authority
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
school building authority was initially
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
put together to look at the bonding
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
authority of the state and the
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
capability of the state being able to go
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
that direction
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
and then once it goes by the school
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
building authority of course when it got
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
to school building authority the last
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
year there was question
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
do we look at the same criteria for
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating these applications
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
as the doe did and initially putting
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
that recommended list together
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted to use a different criteria
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
we as policy said no no no the process
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
is that they come in and they they
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're rated based upon x number of
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
points 250 275 points something like
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
that based on safety uh demographics
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh small room facilities special
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
education all that are in there
 
01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:06.789 align:start position:0%
education all that are in there
we

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
determined that it should be the same
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
criteria until we
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature makes adjustments to
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
this whole process from the school
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
building authority it goes then to the
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
where they have to make a determination
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
of which ones they're approving
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
um and then that's all be done by
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
january 15th of each year
 
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.910 align:start position:0%
january 15th of each year
so

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh the process itself needs
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
a look
 
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
a look
and

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
maybe some re
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
i've i've heard from amy over the d.o.e
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
there's times that they don't even see a
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
need for the school building authority
 
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
need for the school building authority
um

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
so rick um on 1499 i i think this
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee would have a hard time either
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
recommending or not recommending for
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
future legislation this topic without at
 
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.829 align:start position:0%
future legislation this topic without at
least

01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
some study work on it
 
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.230 align:start position:0%
some study work on it
um

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think what you've put out
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
and what others have put out certainly
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of questions and in order
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
to at least put a i think a a
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully a helpful you know final
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
report together in october
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh to be printed in the calendar we
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
should we should at least identify those
 
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.710 align:start position:0%
should we should at least identify those
things

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is a huge topic and i
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
if we think we're going to sit down and
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
resolve it in two or three you know
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
tries during the summer time yeah i mean
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't think we're going to
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
resolve it no but i think i think what
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
we can do is is put together a report
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that either says something like
 
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
that that either says something like
recommended

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
for future legislation pending further
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
investigation into um into
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
make up what the what the things are
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
dissolution of a of a charter use of um
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
obligations of uh you know
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know to um
 
01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:03.029 align:start position:0%
you know to um
to

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
to
to

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
the state or the or other credit holders
 
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
the state or the or other credit holders
uh

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
or not recommended for future
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation because
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
and lists two or three uh things but i
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
think that's going to require a meeting
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
to do not to come up with the answers
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that i i'd really
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
like to understand the process better i
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a good hold on the process
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
of building aid charter schools
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
are you talking about building aid or
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
just charter schools all of it together
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah charter schools exempt from
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
building it yeah
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
there they are
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
when we put this together
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
several years back
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
we we mimicked what they were doing over
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
the state of maine
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we got the
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
plan what they're doing from duke
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
albany's who was the commissioner of
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
education over there
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
he used to be my athletic director
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
and and um they had gone through
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
years of putting this together and
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
if their their whole process is a little
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
bit more complex than ours because they
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
deal with leasing as well
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest that if we're going
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
to be looking at that topic we need to
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
put together a commission study of some
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
kind in future years work with the
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
architects work with
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
engineers work with the department
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
work with educators that are familiar
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
with this process maybe elsewhere and
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
come up
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about just like
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula it's a similar
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to do it
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
during interim study and charter schools
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
that's just just the tip of the iceberg
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
right right and the the you know the
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
outcome from an interim study could be
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
through um through uh commission work to
 
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.470 align:start position:0%
through um through uh commission work to
investigate

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
the uh you know complexity through a
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
commissioned study like up through an
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
interim study we could identify
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
just what we've been talking about right
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
now and get that down so
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislation could be put forward with
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
those type of recommended based on some
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
of those recommendations heavy points to
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
be examined
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
by a study community an interim study
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
could take care of that within several
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
meetings working with amy
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
clark and others there's even one or two
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a huge list yeah i'm
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying yeah a couple a couple times
 
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.630 align:start position:0%
saying yeah a couple a couple times
so

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
so so maybe porter and luna luna will be
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
on it well i'd like to be on it too
 
01:07:36.559 --> 01:07:37.829 align:start position:0%
on it well i'd like to be on it too
okay

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:37.839 --> 01:07:43.190 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
so we have porter luna lad and hobson
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to be on that
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
this is for
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
building aid charter building aid the
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards okay we'll leave at
 
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.829 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards okay we'll leave at
that

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
and where i'm working pretty closely
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
with i'll i'll chair that one and then
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
it'd be lad luno
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
hobson porter okay
 
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.190 align:start position:0%
hobson porter okay
yes

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
district save money by doing helping
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
this charter school fix something would
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
it be could it be cost-effective for
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
them to help them
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
save money because you're going to send
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
all the kids somewhere if they don't and
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
they cost them more to take the kids
 
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
they cost them more to take the kids
back

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
1630

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
1630
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
requiring high school students to
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
complete a half year required course in
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
the introduction to philosophy
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
what do you think about that
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
in the uh adequate um
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
education bill we that we passed um
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
remind me i i think we put logic in
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
there do we have ethics in there too
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that also part of that with logic and
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
so we're getting there going back to
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
your initial thing you talked about a
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
half credit in this subject area
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but it was specifically i was
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
trying to get towards um
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
philosophy as a means of inquiry and
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
using the theory of knowledge and
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
philosophy of science
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
but also added in logic and ethics
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times these lines are
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
blurred people
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
blur ethics up with
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
science one is a
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
statement of facts factual science as
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to a moral statement which is
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
not a is a statement it's an ought
 
01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.350 align:start position:0%
not a is a statement it's an ought
statement

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i think um a lot of uh par what
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
society screws up in in their arguments
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
is that they're mixing it up
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
and that's why anywhere with an interim
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
study i'm not sure
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
reps in
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
hall yeah i don't think this is right i
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think developing curriculum is local
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't see that we would have
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know if you want a philosophy or on
 
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.270 align:start position:0%
you know if you want a philosophy or on
that

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory list that would be one thing
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
but this is about how to integrate
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
a topic into a curriculum thinking
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
skills or whatever i i don't think this
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
is even our role
 
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
is even our role
uh

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
well perhaps announced
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
are there enough people to teach this
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
well i would think that um a lot of its
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
literature could be taught by
 
01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.470 align:start position:0%
literature could be taught by
english

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
english
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
teachers also what is history and also
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
some of the science
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
as in the philosophy of science
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
but as the point of um whether we should
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
mandate it or not uh
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
philosophy the love of wisdom is a
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
foundational to all learning
 
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.470 align:start position:0%
foundational to all learning
um

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
i think the learning the foundation of
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
putting together our thoughts
 
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.149 align:start position:0%
putting together our thoughts
uh

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
is where you have to start with and i
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that uh they kicked socrates to
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
the corner really quickly
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
so rick um i i don't think we need uh a
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
study on um
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
on 1630
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think a lot of these types of
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
subjects are also college level i'm not
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
an expert in this area and i would defer
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
to the educators like yourself rick and
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
to this but uh but you know i you know i
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
think what you're talking about here
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know some pretty heavy-duty things
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
that might require a more fully
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
developed frontal lobe and and things
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
like that to really be able to
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
to process and and and
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know and and develop that you know
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
area of inquiry
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh certainly um um you know k-12 schools
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
do use um uh do you know
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
provide students with curriculum
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
um that that covers a lot of critical
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
thinking skills it may not quite be to
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
the level that uh that you're suggesting
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
here but students might not be ready for
 
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.830 align:start position:0%
here but students might not be ready for
that

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're selling our high
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
school kids a little bit short there but
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
so be it yeah i'm i'm i you know i'm i'm
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
not selling them short i've certainly
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
had um two high school kids of my own
 
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
had um two high school kids of my own
and

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and spent a long time on on school
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
boards and a lot of time volunteering
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
and uh while i think some high school
 
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.270 align:start position:0%
and uh while i think some high school
kids

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
are are certainly
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
great thinkers and
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
probably more mature than i was when i
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
was in in high school i know that a lot
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh aren't and continue to develop that
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
maturity into their into their 20s
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's no fault of their own
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's just physiology i think so
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter and then represent
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
all uh so so i'm gonna step out on a
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
limb a little bit here
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:28.390 align:start position:0%
limb a little bit here
um

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned given
 
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.550 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned given
um

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
and recent statements that have been
 
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.229 align:start position:0%
and recent statements that have been
made

01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:43.110 align:start position:0%
made
about

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
activist teachers
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
might be very difficult
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
without getting into trouble
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
depending on what
 
01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.709 align:start position:0%
depending on what
um

01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
issues were used to help the students
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
learn these skills and
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
i think we need to step back from that
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
right now and let things settle down
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
until we know
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
what's occurring in our schools right
 
01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.149 align:start position:0%
what's occurring in our schools right
now

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
and just to caution
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
don't make them have to do something
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
that if they try to do and do it wrong
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
in some people's views it's going to get
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
this might be one of those subjects
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
that we might want to suggest or in some
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
way encourage
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
in a response such as a gifted and
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
talented program
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
and so you might put reason for example
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
logic those kinds of things just in how
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
you make a statement that isn't valid
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
which really does skirt the kinds of
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
problems that you're talking about if
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to make a statement about
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
something then your logic has to be
 
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.790 align:start position:0%
something then your logic has to be
reasonable

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
in other words it's not convincing
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
that that kind of thing might be brought
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
into being a teacher or someone like
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
that it's just an
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
aspect of writing clearly
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore not as subject to the
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
title false lawsuit
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
and similarly you might do it in
 
01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:34.149 align:start position:0%
and similarly you might do it in
mathematics

01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
and others in a different way of the
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
application of mathematics
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
which you do a certain kind of
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
structured reasoning
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
without getting it all into the subject
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about any subject
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
that you might do it that way and
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
certainly if it's part of a gifted and
 
01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.830 align:start position:0%
certainly if it's part of a gifted and
political

01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:01.830 align:start position:0%
political
level

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
rick

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
rick
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know i think um
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
currently in schools
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
i believe the socratic method is used
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a there's a theory called
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh inquiry
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
inquiry teaching which does exactly what
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative saudi is talking about
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
where you ask questions you you
 
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
where you ask questions you you
basically

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
help students
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
develop their thinking process by the
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
questions i mean
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more powerful than a
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
powerful question
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
rather than a statement as you're
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
working with kids i think that's
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
happening in classrooms all over the
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
state right
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know i i can
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
just tell you through my own experience
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
not in the state but we did have that
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
program in the schools and what came in
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
as a result we had a
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
an individual on our staff which her job
 
01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:56.149 align:start position:0%
an individual on our staff which her job
was

01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
gifted teacher that's you know she was a
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
gifted person but she would she taught
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
kids which are identified as gifted and
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's a whole criteria we had to go
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
through to identify
 
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:08.070 align:start position:0%
through to identify
giftedness

01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
giftedness
 
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.030 align:start position:0%
giftedness
um

01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we used achievement scores she had
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
295's or higher you had an
 
01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
295's or higher you had an
uh

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
iq score of 130
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
going up maybe a maybe down 128 but that
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
was it
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh leadership uh recommendations
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
creativity uh recommendation of parent
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
recognition of teacher
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
and what we found out is that we use the
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
junior great books process i mentioned
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
that a little bit when we talked about
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
this earlier this year
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
and a number of other ways of thinking
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
as you re you say representative meyer
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the the ability for inquiry thinking
 
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:45.990 align:start position:0%
the the ability for inquiry thinking
and

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
what we found is that the program we had
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
soon became a program for the whole
 
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
soon became a program for the whole
school

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
and and it was
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
shared with all the teaching staff
 
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.550 align:start position:0%
shared with all the teaching staff
and

01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
the level of questions and answers was
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
so much different than the factual
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
and and and you can see there's a lot
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
more thought involved with it and that's
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's as i look at this
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
this topic of philosophy i look more at
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
this methodology of how to get thinking
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
going on and it should be
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
utilized by everybody in the school
 
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
utilized by everybody in the school
and

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're getting kids to
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
get to that
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
reasoning level and logic and thinking
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:38.709 align:start position:0%
that is
gonna

01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know really give them
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
the the tools to be ready
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh for life uh so
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
to integrate this as a separate course
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're starting to look like
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
maybe a post-secondary course
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
to integrate it in and embed it as a
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
methodology for teaching and instruction
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
through all this correct we should be
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
doing that right right from the lower
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
intermediate grades
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe more than that all the way
 
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.830 align:start position:0%
and maybe more than that all the way
through

01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about teacher
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
methodology or instruction
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
which is a local responsibility but
 
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.149 align:start position:0%
which is a local responsibility but
um

01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
i have not seen anything come out of doe
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of this in terms of giftedness
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we are a state that does not support
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
that financially whereas a lot of states
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
do they used to do it through their
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
special ed program in fact some states
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
had identified as a
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
not a handicapping condition and maybe
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
it was for some kids a lot of kids are
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
in trouble our gifted kids they're just
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
bored out of their minds
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
and look to other ways of you know
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
showing their
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
the responses so
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see it in start but i don't
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
know it's a separate course i i i don't
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
know how to do that uh it's going to be
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
a very costly deal too
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't worry about the costs
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
here in policy
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
any over here any feelings on
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay sure yes
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know and and and you might work with
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%

dr ranzuli down uconn would you know
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
i have to say this
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
when i had my preschool kindergarten
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
all those kids were gifted
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
kids are all gifted parents all know
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
their kids are gifted there's just
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
different ways of being gifted
 
01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
different ways of being gifted
um

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
my favorite was a little boy oh just a
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
sweetheart who's
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
was struggling all the way through in
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
reading in math and second grade but one
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
day a bird
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
crashed into my picture window and died
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know what kind of bird it
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
was and i knew that this kid was hunting
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
with his grandfather a lot so i stuck it
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the freezer and i brought it into
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
school the next time i came in and i
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
said what kind of bird is this and he
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
gave me
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
all this information about the kind of
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
bird where it lived what it ate how many
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
eggs it laid the colors of the eggs this
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
kid knew all that stuff but he couldn't
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
read and he couldn't write
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
so he was definitely gifted
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
but he probably wouldn't be in a gifted
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay so represent saudi if you want to
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay next one down 1676
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
relative to making incentive grants for
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
16 what 64. oh i jumped one okay
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
requiring certain non-public school or
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
education service providers that accept
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
public funds to perform background
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think where the sticking point was on
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is the um
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
efa program uses the term education
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
service providers in a very very broad
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
definition that includes um suppliers
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
and parents equipment suppliers too yeah
 
01:22:42.639 --> 01:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
and parents equipment suppliers too yeah
um

01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
and and that obviously some of those
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
things like the amazon driver probably
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to pass a a security check
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
for for this they may be passing an
 
01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.350 align:start position:0%
for for this they may be passing an
amazon

01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
amazon
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
security check but not one that's
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
imposed through this
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
type of um of statute so um so this
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
probably does require
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
some work if it's going to move forward
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
we had a bill another bill that was
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
working to try to find out if that was
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
even doable wasn't it
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire's bill that came
 
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.990 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire's bill that came
through

01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
for all of the people
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
background checks for everybody through
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah but that was about having the state
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
be the clearinghouse for background
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
checks right i think this is a little
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
different that it's um that it's
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's requiring who should be um
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
receiving background or submitting to
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and who should be paying for them
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
it may get into that too i i
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
i don't recall but i think that's a i
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
think there's there's strong rationale
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
for for this and making sure that um
 
01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.270 align:start position:0%
for for this and making sure that um
that

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
anybody that's um
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's in an educational setting
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
that that should be
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know submit to a background check is
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
is actually you know that there's one
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
is the department of education currently
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
doing this no well we have attorney
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
fenton here perhaps she could update us
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
on what's going on
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
oh there she's hiding
 
01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.270 align:start position:0%
oh there she's hiding
oh

01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
how you doing i'm good how are you fine
 
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
how you doing i'm good how are you fine
thanks

01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
so in regard to department of education
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
and criminal checks background checks
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
and all that
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh is there a group over there studying
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
this stock right now or is there
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
activity looking at that at the
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
department sure thank you for the
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
question my name is diana fenton uh with
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
the department of education for the
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
record um
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is an area that the
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
department is actively
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
working on constantly thinking about and
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
working on
 
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.229 align:start position:0%
working on
historically

01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
any kind of criminal background check
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 189 colon 13 a was a
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
matter of employment only
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear that the department
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
did not play any role in background
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
checking in any capacity so that means
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
prior to last year's legislative session
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
when the department issued a credential
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
to teach there was no background check
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
done as part of that it was a matter of
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
employment only the department
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
felt very strongly that it did not want
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
to license someone who might have
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
who might be unemployable pursuant to
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
the statute right that was a bad public
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
policy so uh pursuant to legislation
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
that was passed during the pandemic
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
the department is now doing background
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
checks on first-time
 
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.030 align:start position:0%
checks on first-time
uh

01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.030 align:start position:0%
uh
educators

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
educators
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
and uh teacher prep program candidates
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
that is done to help the colleges and
 
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
that is done to help the colleges and
universities

01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
universities
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
um and the department is also doing
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
really a clearance a criminal history
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
clearance for for school bus drivers
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
which allows them to go statewide those
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
are two very different functions they
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
sound very similar but those are two
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
different functions representative
 
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.030 align:start position:0%
different functions representative

01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
mcguire's
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
study commission i'm anticipating that
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
was your question
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
oh rats uh
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
her uh her study commission is a little
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
more narrowly tailored to take the idea
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
of what we've done with bus drivers
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
giving them that kind of statewide
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
mobility if you will to see what other
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
professions go
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
between districts
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
to alleviate the idea of having a
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
multitude of background checks
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
um from one district to another
 
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.910 align:start position:0%
um from one district to another
porter

01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
porter
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so my question is
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
if someone is hired by prenda to be a
 
01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.470 align:start position:0%
if someone is hired by prenda to be a
guide

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
guide
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
and that guide is working with a group
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
of children
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
does that guide have to have a
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
background check
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
working with that group of children
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
the short answer is is yes i do know
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of work that went
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
into that that system any of those
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives that the department rolls
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
out whether it's efas or prenda any of
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
those programs that is a natural
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
component of it as it was the learn
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere program what that background
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
check consists of i i i honestly i'm not
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
sure can i
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
if i called um
 
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.790 align:start position:0%
if i called um
jones

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
jones
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
jones piano teaching okay because part
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
of my child's program is learning music
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
does joan have to have a background
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
check to work with my child
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
as part of the
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
efa program
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
um my i can't answer that exact
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetical i know that in any of the
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
programs the department has has rolled
 
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
programs the department has has rolled
out

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
the background check is a component a
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
component of it how it plays out in each
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
individual scenario
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
is a case by case so if joan
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
registers as an education service
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
provider with the department
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding is yes the there would
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
be a background check component to that
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
who would do the background check
 
01:28:56.639 --> 01:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
who would do the background check
uh

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:28:59.199 --> 01:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
i don't know
okay

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's been my concern with this that
 
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.030 align:start position:0%
that's been my concern with this that
there

01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
are people that should not be working
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
with children for obvious reasons and if
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
this might be a wonderful place for them
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
nefarious way
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement i can't tell you
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head what what that
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
so let me get this right if
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to pete's piano
 
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to pete's piano
teaching

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
and you as a parent decide i'm going to
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
send my child over here
 
01:29:41.679 --> 01:29:43.030 align:start position:0%
send my child over here
and

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
to get reimbursed for that
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
is that you know does the parent just
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
have to show the invoice
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
the cost to
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
kate baker
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
or or does before you're going to get
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
that invoice paid that that pete's is
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to have that kind of check
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
that you just spoke of
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
i would have to look into the details of
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
the efa program i know from kate baker's
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
testimony they have a process by which
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
they vet
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
the people that they work with but i
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't know that process off the top of
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
my head
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think what the the question is
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
what role does the department actively
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
play in conducting the background check
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the department is a
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
governmental entity
 
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.110 align:start position:0%
governmental entity
thereby

01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
thereby
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
can get the federal background check
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
has a limited role to those groups that
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
i told you about which was the school
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
bus drivers the teacher prep program
 
01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
bus drivers the teacher prep program
candidates

01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and first-time educator applicants
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is a very limited role
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
my caveat
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
is always to recognize that the
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
department is actively building this
 
01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.189 align:start position:0%
department is actively building this
infrastructure

01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:04.709 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
and

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have to be mindful of what the
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
department takes on not that there isn't
 
01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
department takes on not that there isn't
um

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
ability for the department to do so but
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
we just have to be mindful of creating
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
the concern being that if
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
any balls are dropped it would directly
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
harm child safety so that's always my
 
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.110 align:start position:0%
harm child safety so that's always my
representative

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
so then there was also the question
 
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:25.830 align:start position:0%
so then there was also the question
about

01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
um the state police and the fbi and all
 
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.709 align:start position:0%
um the state police and the fbi and all
that

01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
the fbi would
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
allows the department to do this
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
the fbi
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
might not allow
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
prenda to do it
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
um because they're not a whatever
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
do you is that accurate
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is similar to yours
 
01:31:55.679 --> 01:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is similar to yours
that

01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's two pieces that make up a
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
criminal background check there is the
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
federal fbi background check and there
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
is the state portion
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
anyone can have access to the state
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
portion if you want to
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
run my new hampshire criminal record you
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
can do so
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
um it is the federal background check
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
that is more limited and because that
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
because that is governed by the fbi
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
regulations my understanding is in
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
talking to the department of safety is
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
it you have to be a governmental entity
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
i.e a school district
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
a state agency in order to get that
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
background check
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
um i do know
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
however that there are certain um
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that rule right every rule
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
has some exceptions and so i know that
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
there were some like the adam walsh act
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
would on occasion allow for example like
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
a camp
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
right camps can have access to the fbi
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
background check i don't know the exact
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
loophole or avenue by which they get
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
access it but i know that there are some
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entities that get it
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's where my knowledge on that would
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
end and i would defer to the department
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
of safety but i can tell you and and i
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
will feel comfortable speaking for linda
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
tana tanner on this anytime you look
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
into this topic
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's just naturally complex and so yes
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions um
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
and and right now the department plays
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
that that limited role but it is a role
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
that we are taking on currently
 
01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:26.229 align:start position:0%
that we are taking on currently
right

01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes rep representative it would seem to
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
me based upon this it would seem to me
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we should at least have a group
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
look at this it may only take one
 
01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:34.870 align:start position:0%
look at this it may only take one
meeting

01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
or we have a report from kate and uh
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
who's ever responsible for the
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
department we now have
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
we now know who the learn everywhere
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
vendors are right now we now know who
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
the efa people are receiving it so it
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that it'd be an ideal time
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
over the summer to look at this
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
and uh then again i don't i don't see it
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
taking a whole lot of time but just to
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
get the clarification
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
as attorney fenton has said so we're
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
clear and
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
from that maybe some legislation that
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
may be needed to be more specific
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
than what's in this particular piece of
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that's before us right now
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
president cordelia um couldn't that also
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
be done by the
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
efa oversight committee i think that
 
01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
efa oversight committee i think that
they

01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
have a meeting
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
the only problem with that is that part
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill also applies to non-public
 
01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.830 align:start position:0%
of this bill also applies to non-public
schools

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.950 align:start position:0%
schools
so

01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know that the efa oversight
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
committee they would be able to do the
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
efa part
 
01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
efa part
but

01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
i think we would be looking at
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
additional facilities if we're
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
going strictly on the language of the
 
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.870 align:start position:0%
going strictly on the language of the
bill

01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
right for for example if the district
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
were to contract with a non-public
 
01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.870 align:start position:0%
were to contract with a non-public
school

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
how many people would like to be on a
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
working committee on this
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
here right now
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
i had uh
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
porter mullen paul tanner
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
are there any others would like to be on
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
put me down i think
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'll join you on that
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
it does raise a lot of interesting
 
01:35:31.119 --> 01:35:33.590 align:start position:0%
it does raise a lot of interesting
questions

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we have then
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
cordura cordelie lad porter mullen hall
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
tanner and cornell
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we will have that and
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
look forward to that okay number 12
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
let's see where we are here relative
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
making incentive grants for school
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
districts that improve in certain
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
assessment scores representative moffat
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
that was i think your bill wasn't it
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
yes it was mr unfortunate
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
i won't say anything yes it was mine i
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
was a prime okay
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh we we put down interim study
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um correct
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
we have you know a whole group doing
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
this because you weren't here at the
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
very beginning or should this be a small
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
group or do we need a group
 
01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.950 align:start position:0%
group or do we need a group
well

01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for asking mr chair if that was
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
directed to me uh
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative hobson and i met uh
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
informally with
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
some folks at d.o.a the commissioner and
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%

a guy uh attorney fenn is a guy who
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
anyway uh yeah so so we chatted with
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
the folks at doa and they're very
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
interested in the concept there's a lot
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
of interest in other places as well
 
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
of interest in other places as well
um

01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
not not to get into the uh
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
the policy pieces here because if we do
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
have a
committee

01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing in subsequent
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
exec session that we flagged some
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns things that we
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
needed to talk about if this if
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
something like this is to move forward
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
which we could get into in a interim
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.750 align:start position:0%
study committee
um

01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh yeah obviously i'd be happy
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
to be involved with the committee to
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
look at the pieces of this that need
 
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.990 align:start position:0%
look at the pieces of this that need
discussion

01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
something like this was to move forward
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this is just an
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
interesting side note
 
01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
interesting side note
um

01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
recently um u.s world put out their
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
rankings of new hampshire high schools
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
and they didn't use standardized test
 
01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:01.430 align:start position:0%
and they didn't use standardized test
scores

01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
scores
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to let everybody know
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
that hillsborough tearing came in quite
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
well in that in that listing and
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
ahead of places like pinkerton and even
 
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
ahead of places like pinkerton and even
concord

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
and some of the other school districts
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
highly regarded in our state so
 
01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:17.830 align:start position:0%
highly regarded in our state so
um

01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
just to throw that out as a
 
01:38:20.159 --> 01:38:21.350 align:start position:0%
just to throw that out as a
little

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
cautionary tale go hellcats
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
represent hobson
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and just a quick question back to rep
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
porter what did they use if they didn't
 
01:38:30.639 --> 01:38:31.590 align:start position:0%
porter what did they use if they didn't
use

01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
standardized test scores they used all
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
sorts of other factors like
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
getting preparation of a college high
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
school graduation rate etc etc there
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
parameters i didn't read the whole
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
statement of all the things that they
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
use but that not only were their schools
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
ranked in the state um but they were
 
01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
ranked in the state um but they were
ranked

01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
ranked
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
nationally as well
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
um by the national rank you can look it
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
up you it you just look up us news and
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
world report new hampshire high school
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
this is uh obviously a money bill too
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about putting forward
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
like a million bucks
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
to use as the carrot or the incentive
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
so obviously it's uh
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
would have a fiscal note too but a
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
question i have is that how do you
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
improve your test scores in your
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
building if your average score already
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
is at the 90th percentile
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
sure this came up when we had the
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and we had the exact session
 
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
hearing and we had the exact session
um

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
schools would be uh
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
competing against themselves not against
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
anybody else and yeah of course if if a
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
school is very very school is very low
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's a great you know room for
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
improvement and
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we talked about that before
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
so in tackling that issue and coming up
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the formula um that that's what a
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
commit our committee if we have one
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
would would talk about
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
um when we met with d.o.a caitlin davis
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
had some specific recommendations as to
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
assessments uh that were very
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
interesting they were actually pretty
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
excited about the concept the actual
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
details obviously were not there yet
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the questions that
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
came up in committee that that is a good
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
question that we would talk about again
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
so who'd like to be on uh a study like
 
01:40:30.719 --> 01:40:32.629 align:start position:0%
so who'd like to be on uh a study like
this

01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
i i have
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
that was submitted to me by
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative miller paul ellison and
 
01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.229 align:start position:0%
representative miller paul ellison and
luno

01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
luno
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay and then hobson and
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
moffat i'm sure
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
amen you're in
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
we'll have seeing that you are the
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill i'm going to put you
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
in charge of the setting up the times
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
and all that so be a committee of the
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
all righty um yeah i'd like to see you
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
know there in the
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh way we
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
how we deliver an adequate education
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's a number of indicators
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
of that besides just standardized tests
 
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
of that besides just standardized tests
uh

01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter mentioned a couple
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
of them on there but that's a laundry
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
list of a good 12 or 13 items
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere from career technical education
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
skills and pathways certification to
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
taking the asvab
 
01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
taking the asvab
to

01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
attendance to suspension expulsion rates
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
all that stuff is part of it
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
and so you might be looking at that as
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
well as a way to assess
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
or to at least consider
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
names again were
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
okay it would be
 
01:42:12.639 --> 01:42:13.669 align:start position:0%
okay it would be
moffat

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
moffat
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
hobson luno ellison hall
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
next one uh
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
1679 relative we did that
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
we put all the cooperative for those you
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
weren't here mike uh all the cooperative
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
bills are in one study of the whole
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
number 14
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me yes representative hall who is
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
on that committee with a cooperative
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
school who do you have that's that's
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
everybody oh that's everybody that's
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's the committee of the whole
 
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
that's the committee of the whole
um

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
hb 1680
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is another one where i think it's
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
important and i like to see this be a
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole as well
 
01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole as well
um

01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
we we talked about a little bit of
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
finance to this year how we fund
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
when it came to that last bill dealing
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
with the extraordinary
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
grant needs grant bill
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with equalized property
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
valuation for those eligible students
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
based on free and reduced meals
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
we also put a component in there dealing
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
with uh weighted
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's been taken out of that bill
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
but i'd love to see that you know that
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's all part of 1680.
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so i think there's some components
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
when 1680 that really deserve our
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
attention and attention of the whole
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.149 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion that's and we we've
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
already had several working groups on
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
that already this year but we will
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
and a lot of good information is coming
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
out of there
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm not necessarily agreeing with
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
everything but it's it's good stuff no
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
no but
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
but i think what we what we can agree on
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
probably is an approach um that uh that
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
looks at the uh definition and cost of
 
01:44:13.199 --> 01:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
looks at the uh definition and cost of
adequacy

01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
and um and the approach to a fiscal
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
policy that um that sort of aligns with
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
with what we've uh with what the courts
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
yeah we also may want to keep our eyes
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
on conval right
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
what's going on there
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh so jumping to uh the last one we have
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
is hb234
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
relative to freedom of speech and
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
association on college campuses gen when
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
did we do that bill yes we did
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
no we did we were a subcommittee on that
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill mr chair and representative mullen
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i were on it
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
and we put it into interim study who who
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
chaired it was was it you that you had
 
01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.189 align:start position:0%
chaired it was was it you that you had
it

01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
i did share it commit it was retained
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
and then we had a five to zero vote
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
recommending itl
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
as i recall no this this was
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
no no i take that back
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
we recommended ies
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
fire study yes five to nothing vote
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
right right right and it was
 
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
right right right and it was
yes

01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
but i but i don't think it needs another
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we we had that done years ago too
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
when we looked at in the
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
status was was put out by fire
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
and since then we've seen some
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
improvements on our college campuses
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the things that we talked
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
about um at length in that subcommittee
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
was the fire report
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
in fact there were representatives there
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
who talked about
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
what they considered to be a a pretty
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
significant improvement because
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
we had unh that was doing okay keane was
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the red plymouth was yellow
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
by the time they got done with
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
all of their investigation and work
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
everybody was green so
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly we interim
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
studied it because we wanted the uh
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
the young man who was the prime sponsor
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
to not get discouraged and moving on to
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
other legislation in the future so
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
i think a disruption of alexander maybe
 
01:46:40.639 --> 01:46:41.270 align:start position:0%
i think a disruption of alexander maybe
yeah

01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.870 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
two terms ago we had a similar bill the
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
not the last term when i was not here
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
but the term before that when i was here
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
and we uh jim grenier and i and and uh
 
01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
and we uh jim grenier and i and and uh
maybe

01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative cornell might have
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
been on we had a
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
we we had a
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
the the guy from unh came in
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
eventually out of that i think we get
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
their attention and some changes were
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
made even though nothing moved forward
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i think there was value just to
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
having that
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee before and and also shining a
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
so we're we need to wrap this up here
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
today um
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
we cannot start any of these interim
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
study studies
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
in this facility until all the
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
committees of conference are done
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
and that will be on the 19th i believe
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
i hope and then the following week is
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
our last week in which we are in session
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at june basically
 
01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:44.070 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at june basically
um

01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
two uh memorial day is going to be
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
coming up and and then in june
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh they could be scheduled
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
and we can start um does anybody here
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
really have
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
travel plans or something coming up in
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
parts of june that we should be aware of
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
when are you having your sue uh i'm
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
leaving for the uk on the 19th of june
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm gone until the 30th
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay wow can you need somebody to carry
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
honestly the reason i'm going is because
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
this whole thing started two years ago i
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be at a wedding
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that got cancelled and or you know
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
postponed and then postponed and then
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
canceled and uh
 
01:48:27.119 --> 01:48:27.910 align:start position:0%
canceled and uh
so

01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
they have they have a child now this
 
01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:34.629 align:start position:0%
they have they have a child now this
couple

01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
couple
 
01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:35.910 align:start position:0%
couple
and

01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
and yet and yet my right and yet my uh
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
