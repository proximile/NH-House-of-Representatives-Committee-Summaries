00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.610 align:start position:0%
legislate on Senate bill 85. is there a
second

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:00.620 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri seconds uh would
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh yes thank you Mr
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I greatly appreciate the intent
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
of this bill however there were some
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
words said in the Committee hearing that
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
that make me say that we're not ready to
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
do this it spoke to a
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
self-self-declared mental health
 
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.670 align:start position:0%
self-self-declared mental health
emergency

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
um while I recognize that people need to
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
have care in those situations we can't
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
have a large change to insurance
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
regulations based upon a self-declared
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
health condition that goes against the
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
way that we practice medicine and
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
especially when we're looking at prior
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
authorizations and a huge change to our
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
insurance program secondly this is a
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
bill that is trying to address a very
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
very needed problem but I think that if
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
self-declared mental health crises to
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
then open up the door for a very very
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
very large provision of services I think
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
that that's just too much and I can't
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
support enough for it is that broad
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.110 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
Shapiro

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
I would hate to miss out on this bill's
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
um what I see it as its major thrust
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is to take a
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
take programming to deal with the
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
waiting room boarding situation which is
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
the mobile crisis teams and to form a
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission that will study how we can
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
make this a sustainable program
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
financially and I think without this
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
bill we don't have a specific group
 
00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:42.139 align:start position:0%
looking at how to
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
fund mobile crisis teams going into the
 
00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:47.150 align:start position:0%
fund mobile crisis teams going into the
future

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be a very
 
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.230 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be a very
unfortunate

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.730 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
um

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
issue with letting this bill go with itl
 
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:57.860 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
secondarily I would say that this is
 
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:02.660 align:start position:0%
just a question to representative Leon
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.509 align:start position:0%
which is
um

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
I know there's a provision in here about
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization requirements for
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
emergency care
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure when you say such a you
 
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.690 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure when you say such a you
know

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
when you talked about
 
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.930 align:start position:0%
when you talked about
um

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
changing Insurance
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
Provisions is that what you're referring
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
to and and I guess I wonder how that is
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
such a major change
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question most
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
health conditions are not self-declared
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
they are diagnosed by a clinician or
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
there's a suspicion of um they're
 
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
treating the patient
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
um right now I could do a finger stick
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I could tell you that I that what my
 
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
blood sugar is and I could do fasting
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
ones but I can't self-diagnose about my
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
diabetic situation
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I can't self-diagnose about any about
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
being bipolar I can't self-diagnose
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
about any of these conditions I think
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
that a self-diagnosis in order to
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide insurance coverage especially
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
because we have other areas that are
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
talking about other coverage so if you
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
come in with anxiety over my ex
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
situation that would then I feel that
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
that would then have that umbrella the
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
anxiety over a certain given Health
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
situation basically include any any care
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
that they feel may be necessary in order
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with that self-diagnosed anxiety
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
over over whatever medical situation
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
they bring our job is to make sure that
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
when we expand things we do them within
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
controlled guardrails because once we've
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
established a position it's very hard to
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
say well we actually didn't mean to
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
include that area because then we're
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing winners and losers
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that's not what we're trying to do I
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that our Health
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
Care system that is you know it is under
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of stress that we're balancing the
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
needs and I do appreciate that the
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
commission is an important structure I
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
do have
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
um speak to the commission sure but then
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
there the commission it's yet another
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
bill that we're seeing where it ignores
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
statute that we have RSA 1449 that
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
statute was designed so that when we
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
have commissions that are giving
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
legislative opinions and that we we view
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
very very we view with a lot of emphasis
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
here in the house and in the Senate that
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
that is made up of over half legislators
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
and not more than 15 people we can get
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
into the situation and I'm not speaking
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
to this makeup of this committee but we
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
can get up into this get into the
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:41.459 align:start position:0%
um where viewpoints tend to be aligned
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
towards expansion of services without
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the other costs to other
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
areas and what other services we're not
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
going to be able to provide in the state
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
if we expand one area so that's why
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's the focus on having more
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
legislators this is one of the areas
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
that probably will come up under the
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
commission on commissions because we've
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
seen several we've seen at least two
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
bills come over from the other body that
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
that give themselves an exemption from
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
RSA 1449 I don't think that that's good
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
policy and while I appreciate the intent
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
around around this this commission I
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
know that I personally can't support
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
ignoring our established law just for
 
00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.470 align:start position:0%
ignoring our established law just for
convenience

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
convenience
 
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.449 align:start position:0%
convenience
follow-up

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
um can you can you
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
um point out
 
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:30.860 align:start position:0%
specifically where the bill talks about
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
self-diagnosis or a self-declared
 
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.670 align:start position:0%
self-diagnosis or a self-declared
diagnosis

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
that was in the testimony that
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
I did to the committee
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
so when we when those two were
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and were part of
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
the drafting of the bill were asked
 
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740 align:start position:0%
about what a um
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
what's they what meant as I said an
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
onset of a mental health condition
 
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:57.980 align:start position:0%
that that was a self-described
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll I'll drop it after this but I
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
would just say as someone who's
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
um used to
 
00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:09.829 align:start position:0%
um used to
um

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
fill in as an emergency services worker
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
for the local Mental Health Center
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
um you know it was never a matter of
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um individual patients
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
um making their own diagnosis um we were
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
talking about in those days people who
 
00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
came to the emergency room and these
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
days hopefully sometimes it's at home or
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
school where a clinician who is in
 
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:35.900 align:start position:0%
consultation with a psychiatrist
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
is interviewing people and um
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
and making diagnosis and making a plan
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
for services and they are the ones that
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
are in communication with the insurance
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
companies so I don't think the reality
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
on the ground is about people
 
00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
probably on your response thank you um
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
and as one response that that's the
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
problem around this if you think that
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
you are having an anxiety attack and you
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
go in expecting that it'll be covered
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
but then they tell you no you're not
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
having an anxiety attack you're having
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
something else which isn't covered by
 
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
your insurance now you're on the hook
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
with that emergency services bill and I
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
think that that's one of the things that
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
they were trying to address with this
 
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.210 align:start position:0%
they were trying to address with this
bill

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
um so this is just part of that
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
challenge representative Weber and then
 
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.090 align:start position:0%
challenge representative Weber and then
representative

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:31.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
well I I appreciate the discussion and I
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the concern based on what
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
people said at the hearing but it's not
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
what the bill says
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
what the bill says is
 
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.409 align:start position:0%
what the bill says is
that

00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:47.390 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
whenever mental health services are
 
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.130 align:start position:0%
whenever mental health services are
covered

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.140 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
and Community crisis intervention
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
services that otherwise meet the
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
definition of Emergency Services set out
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
in RSA 417 F1 it shall be treated as an
 
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:07.580 align:start position:0%
emergency and what we're doing here
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
is simply extending the Emergency
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
Services definition that currently
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
applies to a licensed hospital emergency
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
facility to the mobile services and the
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
definition of an emergency services
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
which is already in the statute
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
requires that before there's coverage
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
there has to be serious Jeopardy to the
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
patient's health
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
or serious impairment to bodily
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
functions or serious dysfunction of any
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
bodily organ or part so there is
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
a very stringent guard rail already in
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
place and the only thing that's changing
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
if we adopt uh this uh amend this bill
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
is where the deliveries of service
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
occurs it it happens closer to the
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
patient and not in a hospital so for
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
that reason I don't think this is likely
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
to result in claims for oh I'm feeling a
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
little anxious today and maybe I'd like
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
to talk to somebody it's not that kind
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
of a situation it's emergency services
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
and they are well defined and statute
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
already representative land
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
for that that's definitely section five
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
but in section four it changes the
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
definition of Emergency Services both
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the freestanding and the brick and
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
mortar so if you would support removing
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
section four which is
 
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
page four lines 8 through 15 to go with
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
the existing definition I would be more
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
favorable to support this bill however a
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
change in definition for emergency
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
services that impacts not only our
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
mobile service but also all of our
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
established facilities I think is far
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
too broad to do without with without
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
very very detailed discussion and since
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
that wasn't brought up in the in in our
 
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
commentary here I think that we may have
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
underestimated just how far reaching
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
this change could be representative
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
Weber uh but
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just working my way back
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
through this and then the introductory
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
I think there's certainly opportunity
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
for greater Clarity but as I read it the
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph would be the top
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
part and the conditions would still
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
remain but I I can see what your point
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
is about the definition
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
um if you would be willing to pass the
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
um section four taken out
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
I I'd certainly consider that I I don't
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
know I'll leave it to other people who
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
are more versed in the area in case they
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
have an opinion but I think that might
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay all right all right thank you
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative yeah go ahead I do thank
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
you I'm looking at section three
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
and my question on section three has to
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
do with the makeup of this committee
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
um or the study commission I thought
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
study commissions needed to have a
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
greater percentage of members of the
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
legislature am I mistaken on that or is
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative Weber my understanding is
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
that a committee is made up of only
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature a commission
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
is made up of members of the legislature
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
and others and I see our researchers
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
nodding her head so I'm feeling a little
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the statute that representative Leon
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
was referencing which is 14 colon 49 it
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
does state that the legislative members
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
shall constitute a majority of the
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
commission I haven't counted them but um
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
what I see here is
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
um a sub the number from the house and
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate right is four and then
 
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.210 align:start position:0%
the Senate right is four and then
there's

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
um various departments represented but
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
there's a number of private
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
organizations that are there private
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
non-profit in some cases
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
um that represent a larger percentage
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't sure whether we had to fix
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
that or not
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
could I ask for the statutory reference
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
again please Mr chairman sure
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bushman with the statute
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:36.020 align:start position:0%
oh two C thank you yes
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I thought your passing comes
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
I can read it if I'm I'm a visual person
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
but three person I think yeah I read it
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
for everybody else okay so 1449 Roman
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
numeral two c no commissions shall have
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
more than 15 members and may include
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
appointees who are not members of the
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
general court the legislator legislative
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
members of the commission shall
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
constitute a majority of the commission
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
the term of the members of the general
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
court who serve on the commission shall
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
be con
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
contemporary contemptedness with the
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
terminal office unless they are
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
appointed in a capacity other than a
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislative office
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
so what I see is the majority of this
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
commission is not members of the court
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I think we have to make a change to
 
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:27.740 align:start position:0%
section three if this is moving forward
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
okay representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um just one other point that
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
um makes me very very hesitant to move
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
this bill forward at all is we are
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
expanding Insurance mandates which is
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
something on principle that I'm not
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
and this would broaden it to significant
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
new services that are required to be
 
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.049 align:start position:0%
new services that are required to be
covered

00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
covered
yeah

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
other other comments uh representative
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
old you just put your backpack on I did
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:05.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
in this committee what is the process
 
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
for a vote right um I believe there's an
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
itl motion which would solve all the
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
issues that have been brought up so far
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
I believe representative calling the
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
role when discussion is over when debate
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
is over
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh any other representative Shapiro
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
um just in response to representative
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
Cushman I I'm not sure that this
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually extends cover insurance
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
coverage at all it just it it maintains
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
some kind of same coverage
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.190 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.390 align:start position:0%
um
Pro

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
eliminates the um pre-authorization for
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
that coverage I don't think it increases
 
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
that coverage I don't think it increases
coverage

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
chairman um for the benefit of everybody
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
can I read the Emergency Services
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
definition uh both how it stands and
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
then how it would stand with the bill it
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
currently reads Emergency Services means
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
health care services that are provided
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
to an enrollee insured or subscriber in
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
a licensed hospital emergency facility
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
as by a provider after the sudden onset
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
of a medical condition that manifests
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
Itself by symptoms of sufficient
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
severity that a prudent layperson with
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
average knowledge of health and Medicine
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
could reasonably expect that the absence
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
of immediate medical attention could be
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
expected to result in any of the
 
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.330 align:start position:0%
expected to result in any of the
following

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
what the this bill does when it's
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
amended is it adds or set out in section
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
five which would be 415-5 colon 5. and
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's the one for the mobile mobile
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
services and so I think that actually if
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
we were to amend that section to me that
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
would make sense if Our intention is to
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
have more mobile Outreach but so it
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
would read in the licensed hospital
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
emergency facility or these no mobile
 
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
trucks by a provider after the sudden
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
onset of a medical or mental health
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
condition or substance use disorder that
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
manifests Itself by symptoms of
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
sufficient severity that a prudently
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
person with average knowledge of health
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
and Medicine could reasonably expect
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
that the absence of immediate medical or
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
mental health attention could be
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
expected to result in any of the
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
following and so that expands it to both
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
not just Medical but also mental health
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
and substance use disorder which is
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
which is a very large expansion maybe
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
necessary but very large and we're not
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance the committee that usually
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
deals with insurance
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
so you know the discussion
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
all right I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
there was a significant amount of
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
concern when we were discussing this
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
bill initially about the supervision for
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
the nurses who were not yet licensed so
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
my amendments simply adds in changes the
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
language to say the individual meaning
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
the student nurse that's not yet
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
licensed has direct on-site supervision
 
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
while providing Health Care Services
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
because we were a little anxious about
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
whether the supervision would be right
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
there and what we were told at the time
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
was some camps are large enough to
 
00:31:56.769 --> 00:31:56.779 align:start position:0%
require by Statute
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
more than one nurse and we felt or I
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
felt that it was reasonable in that
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
circumstance where you have a license
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
been experienced practitioner on site
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
that one or more of the other people who
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
were caring for the campers could be
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
nursing students
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and so for that uh reason if you will
 
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.100 align:start position:0%
permit I would move uh Amendment 1456
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
1458 h
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%

um I think that this is great that we're

getting to this agreement here we know
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
that the health care shortage is really
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
impacting things and especially with our
 
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
summer camps we're trying to get back to
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
normal and the more that we can get
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
people in so the kids can get back to
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
their summer camps and get people back
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
employed in this profession and maybe a
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
re-entry for some of these nurses as
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
Outreach and I'm very happy that we're

okay uh the next bill up is 127 and
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with a number of committee
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
members we're going to continue that to
 
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:27.020 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to alert the committee
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
that I have an amendment to the very
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
first part of that bill and I don't know
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
if people want it passed out now or
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
would prefer to hold it until next week
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
should we take a look at it
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
um sure I'd be glad to pass it out at
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
this point sure
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
I think it's gonna do it this way that's
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
the larger one
 
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I I would if I may Mr Mr chairman
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
just state that all it does is address
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
the concerns about the from
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards who had concerns
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
about the fees that were assessed the
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
language was confusing uh DHHS kindly
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
clarified for us exactly what they do
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
and this amendment reflects exactly what
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
they do they charge one thousand dollars
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
as the initial fee and then every year
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
after that they charge eight eight
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
dollars a client and that has been in
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
place for some time and the I can
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
represent that the amendment was
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
acceptable to representative Edwards and
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
to the Department
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
I remember seeing Email exchange between
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so thank you for
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
doing this you're welcome
 
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.450 align:start position:0%
doing this you're welcome
okay

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:01.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think that this
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
um is definitely an important part to
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
clean up and it's very nice thank you
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for bringing us
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
this language
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I I know that we're going to continue
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill I wonder if um if
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
we want to deal with all the Amendments
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
later probably so that it's cleaner or
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
if we'd want to adopt this one because
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
while this is not an 86 part bill it
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
still does have a lot of different
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
moving pieces to this one which is why
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
we need this additional time to make
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't unwittingly pass
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
something through that we later regret
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I would I would suggest
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
that if other people have other member
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
other amendments to other parts and I'm
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
sure that Ms Dyer will correct me if I'm
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
wrong about this my understanding in the
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
past from OLS has been if only
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
amendments are to separate pieces of the
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation then OLS at the end can take
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
each piece and incorporate it into one
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
whole if there are other amendments to
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
this particular section then it would be
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
better for whoever wants to amend it to
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
incorporate this language as well as
 
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:13.220 align:start position:0%
whatever other amendments they want
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know what people are
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
bringing in terms of other amendments
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
but it would be useful to have that
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps put off for later so that it's
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
all part of a whole I would think so too
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
that works for me I just wanted to uh
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
question since uh I know we had had OLS
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
working overtime last year when we had
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
our multi-fart bill I'm sure
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay any any other concern uh yes
 
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
um I just if this new Amendment does get
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
added to a bigger part of other
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
amendments I just want to note that
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
based on my reading of it it does look
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
like it will actually change the
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
definition and the fee structure because
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
um beforehand it said that
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
um if basically if you're a new provider
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
you're going to be paying the thousand
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
dollars plus eight dollars per client so
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
your very first year could be well over
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars whereas the new
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
language it makes it sound like if
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
you're initial it's only a thousand
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
dollars and after that eight dollars so
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
it will I mean it could very well be
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
that your very first year could be
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
several thousand dollars based on your
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
language based on the new language it
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how many uh clients you
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
have it's only going to be a thousand
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
dollars so it does appear to change the
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
the actual definition
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
it does change the actual definition
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
which was unclear but what I was told by
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS is that this is the way the statute
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
has been implemented and as long as this
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
is what we're already doing I thought it
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
was more prudent for us to say it up
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
front rather than and to say it more
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
clearly because there was a great
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity to misunderstand the earlier
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
one as we'd all read it in different
 
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.730 align:start position:0%
one as we'd all read it in different
ways

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.430 align:start position:0%
ways
so

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
what's that representative Hall thank
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
you just reading this as a follow-up to
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative King I guess I could
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
interpret this if there was only I don't
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
know 50 clients the subsequent and fees
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
I believe that that was related to the
 
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.370 align:start position:0%
I believe that that was related to the
startup

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
startup
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
s of getting programs up and running and
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
that after that it was then dependent
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
it will go to 171 no 200 right
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay all right we're going to skip over
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
171 we will be going back to it again
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue 127 to next week
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
moving on to 200 I'm actually the
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor one of the co-sponsors of
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
that bill and um representative Leon do
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
you want to recognize me for a motion
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah so if we have an amendment so
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
should we do the amendment first yes
 
00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:02.540 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative of Palazzo yeah I would
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
like to offer an amendment and speak to
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
it it's been distributed right now
 
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:21.910 align:start position:0%
it it's been distributed right now
um

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
could those of us who have not had a
 
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
yeah oh did you pass it out yeah they're
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
coming around now that the amendment is
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:24.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:24.849 --> 00:43:24.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
why don't you move the adoption of the
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
amendment first um
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm uh I'm moving uh to adopt uh
 
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.349 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm uh I'm moving uh to adopt uh
Amendment

00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:37.690 align:start position:0%
Amendment
2023

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:37.700 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
1451h to SB 200 how to pass to pass
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative McLean seconds
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov I like to speak
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
to your motion uh yeah yeah uh thank you
 
00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:56.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
Bill uh uh gives uh additional medical
 
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:06.500 align:start position:0%
freedom in relation to certain
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
injections made by optometrists but
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns about
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
safety of some of the vaccines listed in
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
the original bill so I offer Amendment
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
1451 H which Atlas is both of these
 
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:35.900 align:start position:0%
issues for so
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of giving more medical freedom
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
and address certain illnesses that can
 
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.089 align:start position:0%
and address certain illnesses that can
cause

00:44:46.089 --> 00:44:46.099 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:48.130 align:start position:0%
cause
uh

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:48.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:50.540 align:start position:0%
eyesight so
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
we have testimonials that shingles
 
00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:57.500 align:start position:0%
vaccine might be important in terms of
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
adolescent Vision issues so I
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
specifically left that vaccine and I
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
added another 11 vaccine so it's like
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
four times more than a regional Bill
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
those vaccines that are worth right and
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
have well well established knowledge
 
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:21.380 align:start position:0%
about how effective they are
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:30.500 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at three EQ I'm
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
ready to open it up for more vaccines
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
but give some awaken period until July
 
00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:44.300 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 for some other
 
00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:47.900 align:start position:0%
vaccines where it's either
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
unknown efficiency or known concern of
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
side effects
 
00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:56.230 align:start position:0%
side effects
so

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.060 align:start position:0%
specifically a
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
we know that uh
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
ah we can't predict how effective it
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
will be until next wave of this highly
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
mutating virus so that's why I felt uh
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be in the original list of
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
vaccines and the the second one is
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines and uh as a vaccines
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
that use the same Technologies
 
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:39.500 align:start position:0%
signs on covid-19 vaccines have not been
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
settled completely it's keep changing
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
certain countries like Switzerland just
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
moved to pause Administration and here
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
it took almost two years for our DHHS to
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the connection between
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines and myocarditis
 
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:03.260 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
just uh recently a guidance for small
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
kids changed from two adult doses it
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
went to one half those so why did happen
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's either medication was too effective
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
or too dangerous and we know that uh
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines don't stop the
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
transmission of the virus so it's not
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
about Effectiveness it's because there
 
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:33.380 align:start position:0%
are some dangerous side effects
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
this bill does not deal uh with kids but
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
for example a CDC data from New
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shows that four times more
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
minus date after covid-19 vaccines here
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
then after covet itself and
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
in relation to optometrist my concern is
 
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:57.260 align:start position:0%
that some of the reported
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
effects from covid-19 vaccines well
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
actually eye disorders in April of last
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
year as there were over eight thousand I
 
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
just saw this reported and it might be
 
00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:13.970 align:start position:0%
just saw this reported and it might be
um

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.730 align:start position:0%
um
because

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:15.740 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
there are some micro strokes and
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
we don't know there are different cities
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh why those side effects like many
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
people think that it's uh because uh
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
Spike priority and is toxic and I put
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
that language uh lipid nanoparticles I
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
saw that uh about in New Hampshire a
 
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:46.940 align:start position:0%
resident who died in Massachusetts
 
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:51.500 align:start position:0%
hospital with uh allergic reaction to
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
phospholipids so so I think it's
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
important as to wait two years and see
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
what's causing but another theory that
 
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:04.700 align:start position:0%
might be true and maybe not that
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh it's important how we administer this
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines if suddenly a large
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
portion of vaccine goes to bloodstream
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
and in-depth in tissues where it was not
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
intended maybe that's what causes side
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
effects in some small percentage of
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
people and I'm mentioning it because
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
we are bringing a new group of people
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
who will be administering this vaccines
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
with less training that than those who
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
are ministering it now so
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
those concerns are important so that's
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying
 
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:49.940 align:start position:0%
practice on those 12 vaccines that are
 
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:55.339 align:start position:0%
known and then after this period
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
and after science settled you will be
 
00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.530 align:start position:0%
and after science settled you will be
able

00:49:59.530 --> 00:49:59.540 align:start position:0%
able
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
to administer those vaccines that are in
 
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180 align:start position:0%
you and have some known side effects
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you other
 
00:50:11.819 --> 00:50:14.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you other
discussion

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative McLean oh did I see you
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
hand it yeah uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'm I'm inclined to to support
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
the bill and the the amendment
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
um what the bill does is it expands
 
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
access to vaccines one of the things I
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
know from personal experience when I
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
tried to get vaccinated for the coveted
 
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.650 align:start position:0%
tried to get vaccinated for the coveted
vaccine

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I contacted my PCP because I wanted
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
to have a discussion and I couldn't even
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
get through the the nurses were
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
basically uh the Guardians they said no
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
you have to go to a clinic when I went
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the clinic you couldn't have any
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
really comprehensive discussion at all
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
this I think at least you know an
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
optometrist is a physician it gives you
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
an access and they would be trained as a
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
part of this so you know it gives you an
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have uh increased access
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
to both the vaccine and to those
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
discussions so I think it's good
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I did get some emails from
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
constituents a lot of my constituents
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
have a lot of back vaccine hesitancy
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
because of the way that kind of things
 
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
were rolled out within the pandemic so I
 
00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:24.740 align:start position:0%
think what this amendment of
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
Representative palazzov does is it
 
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
allows you to basically get this in get
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
it going but some of those vaccines that
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
are newer and more controversial it kind
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
of just puts a hold on them for a little
 
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
bit so that we can get the program
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
established and it sunsets in two years
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
so uh the impact of that is is is
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
marginal but it does allow things to get
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
established and those other vaccines
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
will be uh brought online in a couple
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
years so I think it's a good Amendment
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
and I think the bill underlying is good
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
as well and I'll support it thank you Mr
 
00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:00.349 align:start position:0%
as well and I'll support it thank you Mr
chair

00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy did you yeah
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
I I would tend to agree
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
um with the idea that the availability
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
of increasing access to um
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
a vaccine through the optometrist office
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable concept I had my
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill the original
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
bill in some of the um the effects it
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
might have but certainly increasing the
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
access to um
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine for a pandemic or an
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
epidemic is critical going forward
 
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.790 align:start position:0%
epidemic is critical going forward
um

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
and it is not to say that any of these
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
vaccines that you have listed in the
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
amendment uh are without side effects I
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
mean every one of them has side effects
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
we've kept in the shingles vaccine one
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
of the most devastating complications
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
potentially of shingles vaccine is
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
Guillain-Barre syndrome and and so you
 
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
know it's not like these vaccines are
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
without their risks
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
I also am concerned about the hesitancy
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
about specifically addressing vaccines
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
that are based on the newer technology
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the MRI technology really what that
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
technology did was to accelerate the
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
safety process of developing a vaccine
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
so if you are totally against all
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
vaccines or any vaccines that's your
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
prerogative but to this to dismiss all
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines or any specific vaccine based
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
on the technology which is new and
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
different I think is somewhat concerning
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
the last thing I would say is that the
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill also was to have a
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine available during acute outbreaks
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
of either pandemics or epidemics
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have a lot of time in which to
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
and the reason they didn't have this
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
bill two years ago is it would have
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
taken time and by the time that they can
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
get access to given the vaccine those
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
that could be qualified to do so would
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
the pandemic or epidemic could be passed
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
by that time so I I think that you know
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
the the intent of having influenza
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
vaccines in coveted vaccines
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
specifically were meant to address very
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
acute episodes of pandemics and
 
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
epidemics in the environment
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
um and so I would I I just cannot
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
support a bill that targets these
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
specific vaccines based on either the
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
technology used to make it and it's
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
specifically targeting those vaccines
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
which are meant to acutely address
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
pandemics or epidemics going forward so
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:38.420 align:start position:0%
Merchant and representative Weber
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
fundamentally I support having greater
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
access to vaccines for the public
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
my concern here is that which we've
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
heard from the optometrist was starting
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
slowly given all the vaccines at one
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
time does not give somebody the
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go down the road with a
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
few vaccines I think influenza quite
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
frankly is probably the least
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
problematic of all the ones but it's
 
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
going to be withheld until 2025.
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
so I would say at this point in time is
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're looking at trying to encourage the
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
optometrist to give a vaccine the most
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
common one that's given out there is
 
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.410 align:start position:0%
common one that's given out there is
influenza

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
um however if you look at the amendment
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
you really can't give influenza until
 
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:24.589 align:start position:0%
you really can't give influenza until
2025.

00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of ways they're not going to
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
give the vaccine which is probably the
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
most safer vaccine to again learn how to
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
get vaccines and go down that road if I
 
00:55:37.609 --> 00:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
look at it from a public safety point of
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
view is I'd rather have them start
 
00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
slowly but also include vaccines like
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
influenza in order for them to get a
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
learning curve once they go down the
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
road I would say in two years from now
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
then expand the vaccine to all the
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
vaccines but that's my concern is that
 
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
the most safe vaccine listed is the one
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
that they can't even give until 2025.
 
00:55:59.049 --> 00:55:59.059 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
I would concur with what representative
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant said and the the other thing is
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
words of my colleague who normally sits
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
next to me about sort of free market
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
allowing people to access and make their
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
own decisions and that's what the
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
original bill was and again it was to
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
create access particularly in times when
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
greater access was needed what this does
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
is it removes the greater access for
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the things that were asked
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
for in the original Bill and adds a
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
great number of things that were not
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
asked for in the original Bill and while
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
I I understand the concerns that
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov is addressing
 
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
here I think that
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
people get to make their own decisions
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
and it's not as if anybody's forcing
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
anybody to go and get a vaccine at an
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
optometrist's office it is a choice that
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
people make and if they have any
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
concerns about either influenza vaccines
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
or coveted vaccines I would hope that
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
they would simply abstain until they
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
have satisfied themselves that this is
 
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
the right vaccine for them to be having
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to leave that in the
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
hands of individuals rather than in the
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
hands of the legislature so for that
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
reason I'm going to oppose the amendment
 
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
because I think it really guts the
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
original intention of the Bill thank you
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for this Lively
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it's wonderful to see
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
how far we've come in the last few years
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
that now both sides of the aisle are
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
recognizing the people's right to make
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
their own decisions about what drugs and
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and vaccines they think
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
are appropriate to take based on the
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
level of data I want to address
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's concerns about
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
sort of the vaccine hesitancy around the
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccines so it's not really a
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
concern from what I've seen with the
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
with the hesitant community that it's a
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
30 year old new technology the big
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
concern is that the initial approval of
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
the MRI and ra vaccines collected less
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
long-term follow-up data than was
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
actually described in the original
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
clinical trial design and the big
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
concern I'm using FDA words even though
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in the community don't
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
use FDA words the big concern is that
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
that initial trial will be used as a
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
predicate approval to allow all future
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
mRNA vaccines to be approved without
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
their own stand-alone human safety study
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
so this is all comes down to a concern
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
around that original predicate approval
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
we were in a crisis it made sense to
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
allow that crossover and to allow less
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
data collection at that point because we
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
needed to bring something to Market so
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
those who wanted to would have a choice
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
we're past that initial crisis and so
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
the big concern is to make sure that
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're not using that as a predicate
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
approval so I just want to make sure
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
that that we understand that it's more
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
about the process and the fact that that
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
approval shouldn't be the building block
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
for all future vaccines as opposed to a
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
resistance against new technology and
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
then as far as the amendment I really
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um the how it was brought
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
forward and the fact that we're trying
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
to address these concerns to me I think
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the limited one that we initially
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
had as the bill does give a smaller step
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
into it and and I think that I do think
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to address not allowing
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
that initial trial to be a predicate for
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
anything that's mandated in the state or
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
and that we use caution around any
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's that that's built off of that
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
predicate but I think that we can
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
address those concerns in a different
 
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
way so I I'm in more support of the
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
under buying bill so unfortunately I
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
won't be supporting the amendment
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro did you have your
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
hand up earlier no representative Nagel
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
and representative um I just wanted to
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
point out something
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
um basically influenza as you say is the
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
most commonly prescribed vaccine
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
um it's actually been totally eliminated
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
hemophilus influenza and influenza are
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
not the same thing totally different
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
things so I'm just curious why the flu
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov did you want to
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:33.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
that those things comparing to other
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
General one uh
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
was temporarily removed not completely
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
little more but temporary name of the 19
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines and hemophilus influenza
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine so maybe there was some issues
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
with original bills that needs to be
 
01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:58.510 align:start position:0%
with original bills that needs to be
addressed

01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
as a bacterial and it had the concern is
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
that it can progress to meningitis
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's why vaccination was developed but
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
it's not the same thing as the influenza
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
vaccine and it's unfortunate they have
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
the same word but
 
01:01:13.809 --> 01:01:13.819 align:start position:0%
um anyways
 
01:01:15.849 --> 01:01:15.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
oh awesome you made my point thank you
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative lonza
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question or just
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
a statement
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
um so I've given out many uh vaccines I
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
worked at Southern New Hampshire as a
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer for
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
um and so with the covid
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
um pandemic that we had and I did see a
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
lot of people who did have adverse
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
reactions so
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
um in in allowing the
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
um optometrist I think we do need to
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
proceed very slowly we um I agree with
 
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
what a representative Merchant said we
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
can't just forge ahead right away and go
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
into allowing them to give everything
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
out and I think they have to also make
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the availability to
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
have epinephrine and everything else
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
available within their offices because
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
we never know and they also need to
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
check with their own primary care
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
physician prior to getting going to the
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
optometrist and get doing that because
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
if they've had a reaction on another
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine in the past
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
they should not probably go to the
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
optometrist and get that vaccine they
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
should actually go to their own
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
physician and that's where we need to
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
really think about you know being very
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
careful about this thank you
 
01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll try to be brief you
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
touched on something that's very
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
important um it is sort of addressed in
 
01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:52.700 align:start position:0%
the bill it's this almost the same
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
requirements on the optometrist says is
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
on pharmacist Pharmacy interns and
 
01:02:59.690 --> 01:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
um with a few changes that are with a
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
couple one thing left out that I'll
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
touch on later not on the amendment but
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
so the amendment is kind of conflicting
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
for me personally
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
um on the one hand I want to expand free
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
market access to anybody who wants to
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
try a medication or in this case a
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
preventative pharmaceutical product
 
01:03:24.289 --> 01:03:24.299 align:start position:0%
um and on the other hand we've seen that
 
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
the laws are kind of tipped in favor of
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
quick approval of these things and
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
um so there are some issues there but to
 
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:35.579 align:start position:0%
your point it does require that the that
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
they review the
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
um vaccine registry or other records
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
before administering vaccination and if
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
everyone is doing what's required for
 
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.289 align:start position:0%
everyone is doing what's required for
that

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
um the registry the if there's an
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction that's a vaccination
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
event that has to be recorded in the
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
registry so there would be at least a
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
cue like oh they've had an adverse event
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
and it's here
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and it does require that they give
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
notice to the primary care provider when
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
the when the patient designates one
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
um just to let the primary care provider
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
know that they received this so that
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
they are on the same page and the main
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
person following their care knows
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
um but you're you're right at the
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
beginning there's there's nothing really
 
01:04:22.569 --> 01:04:22.579 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they make that judgment
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know saying hmm you've had an
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction I don't want to do this
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just kind of I'm torn on this
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a hold on the MRNA
 
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.809 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a hold on the MRNA
um

01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
vaccines being administered carp launch
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
just because of all the issues that have
 
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.349 align:start position:0%
just because of all the issues that have
been

01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
um seen with the covid vaccines with the
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccines in general and if we're
 
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
gonna you know approve successive
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
vaccines based on that it's concerning
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so I'm very torn on this
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not I'm not sure where I'm
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
gonna fall on this amendment but um I do
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing it Forward
 
01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:04.549 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing it Forward
anyway

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
there was some mixed directions I want
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
to state that I'm if we want to continue
 
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
I am open to change my amendment to
 
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:21.500 align:start position:0%
include flu vaccine into immediately
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
available to optometrists if there will
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
be enough support from committee for
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
that and if not
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
I think we should uh
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
um move ahead with emotion
 
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
um move ahead with emotion
okay

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
any other discussion or comment yes
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
representative Weber just one more
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
comment about revising the amendment I
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
think we took very vigorous testimony at
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
the hearing about the level of
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
preparedness and
 
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:57.500 align:start position:0%
um and precautions
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
that would be it would happen in
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
Optometry offices uh with the three
 
01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:04.789 align:start position:0%
Optometry offices uh with the three
original

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
um vaccinations and I was convinced at
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
that point that certainly it sounded to
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
me like they would be administered
 
01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:18.010 align:start position:0%
me like they would be administered
safely

01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:18.020 align:start position:0%
safely
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
as safe as any of these administrations
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
are in an optometrist uh office but we
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
haven't heard about all of the Myriad
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
other things so I my comfort level would
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
be much better served by sticking with
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
the original Bill thank you president
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:40.849 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
in reference to the amendment several of
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
those seem like they're children
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
specific for the most part most measles
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
measles mumps and rubella type things
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
that are that are
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
administered in a childhood schedule
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
more so than adults
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
um secondly I'm glad that it references
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
it continues about
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
referencing the adverse Reporting System
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern stems from allergic
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
reactions especially in children that
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
you might not know this
 
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.870 align:start position:0%
you might not know this
um

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
I remember very distinctly seeing a
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
nurse right someone who practices
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
medicine who did a particular like
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine as part of the televised
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
broadcast and then collapsed into
 
01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:28.619 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic shock
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
um and this is someone who routinely
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
works in the healthcare industry and
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
would know more so than the average
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
adult what their particular
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
um what particular concerns they may
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
have in their own health so
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
why I like opening up a free market I
 
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
think that's good and I'm letting
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
parents make informed decisions in this
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
case with the ones that are children
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
related I'm a little bit more concerned
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
than the primary care physician I do
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
have a question and I don't know if this
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
is the right time to ask relative to the
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
original bill of the chair
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
is is there
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
is there an appetite amongst the
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
committee to modify section three
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
removing covid-19 in section o
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated one because this
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't exist but I'm just
 
01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
trying to ask a question
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
and then including
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
section Q of Representative palazzov's
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment right and the reason I asked
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
that combination
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
we would have to go have that drafted
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
is there has been some reluctance to
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
these new technologies
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
I do medical product design that pays
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
the bill so my family can afford to eat
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
and I know what it takes to get a 510k
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
submission for a medical device I know
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
how long and how rigorous getting
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
approval through the FDA is for products
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
that are on the market that you want to
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
make a simple change to
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
and my concern is and and I think this
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
is where the vaccine hesitancy came from
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
was some of the covid technology was
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
pushed through very rapidly and I'm not
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
sure it was vetted as well as it maybe
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
should have we definitely don't have any
 
01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:10.309 align:start position:0%
should have we definitely don't have any
long-term

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
um data because it doesn't exist and
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
maybe putting that portion on hold would
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
be valuable so I guess if there's an
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
appetite amongst the committee to make
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
those two changes I would offer to go
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
get that drafted at OLS representative
 
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.130 align:start position:0%
get that drafted at OLS representative
Weber

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:24.140 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.970 align:start position:0%
Weber
laughs

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
I will just say that I just had
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
breakfast so I have very little appetite
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
I I I am willing to go along with the
 
01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:39.140 align:start position:0%
um bill as it was introduced I'm still
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
unpersuaded that a lot of Optometry
 
01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:44.060 align:start position:0%
offices are going to do this
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
I am willing to go along with the
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
original bill because it was what we
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
were asked to do but in the absence of
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
more hearings and more input I'm really
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
really uncomfortable changing the policy
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
when we already have policies that
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
include many other ways of getting these
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
things and different ways under which
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're administered I don't think
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
making things more complicated for the
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
optometrists is actually going to
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
increase access so
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the struggle for me was do I want to
 
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
extend access to the optometrist in a
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
limited way
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I I have come down to the idea that
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
yes I do
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
um unless when we get to that discussion
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
I hear other things uh but I am not
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable at all going beyond the
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
bounds of the original Bill thank you
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative Wayan um thank you Mr
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh this is actually
 
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
building off of Representative Fool's
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
comment um I too for a while paid the
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
bills um in a medical technology related
 
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
position I actually advised investors on
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
where to put their money and quite
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
frankly if I had told anybody to expect
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
an approval process as incredibly
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
streamlined as we saw I probably could
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
have been sued for financial negligence
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we saw something that's never been
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
seen before was never really expected
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
and is so far outside of the process
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
that that that continuing to drag some
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
heels in about including more of the
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccines it makes a lot of sense
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
because you would never seen approvals
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
this fast but for and it would have been
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
fiscally irresponsive Finance it would
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
have been fiduciary irresponsible of me
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
to suggest that it was possible
 
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
to suggest that it was possible
um

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that as far as as far as we
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
we look at these different ones I'm
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if it makes sense for us to
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
vote on this amendment I'm not sure
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
where we're all going to come down it's
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
quite possible that we may end up coming
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
with um with
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
I guess see where our position is about
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
the more streamlined amendments that
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
representative hole had I don't know
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
what representative palazzov says but
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
um if that's something where there's
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
appetite maybe that would be a position
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
um to take yeah I I would I would be
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
open to visit my amendment to free I
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
will move forward with left and what
 
01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative suggested
 
01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
representative suggested
um

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman could I suggest
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead once we have dispensed with
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
this first amendment we could certainly
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
as a committee I believe take a straw
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
poll as to whether people wanted to
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
proceed with representative full
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
suggestion and that might make it a
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
little clearer as to what we wanted to
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
do after that okay yeah
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
sounds good okay any other discussion on
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
so you know the discussion all right so
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the motion is ought to pass on
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1451 H to Senate bill 200.
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%

representative Weber

representative Weber
no

01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative McKay

representative Lanza no
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
Representative no
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh four to 16.
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
they met the amendment fails four to 16.
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
um as as to another amendment
 
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
um let's do yeah let's do a straw poll
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
who is it who uh would think that would
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
be a good idea of what's appropriate
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber so hands are
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh I believe we can do a straw poll by a
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
show of hands and if the question is
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
should I mean if you put the question to
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
the committee should we pursue an
 
01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:42.140 align:start position:0%
amendment in the nature of what
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative hold was suggesting we'll
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
get an ideas to how people feel about
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
so for for clarity right it was removing
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 section out of the original
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
Bill and adding language similar or
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
maybe verbatim to section q3q of
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
um representative palazzo's bill right
 
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
to put on hold any new technology is is
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
I think what we're taking a straw poll
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
on correction can I ask clarification
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
sure representative Merchant thank you
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
represent poll so basically we're going
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
to exclude if you will in line 12 of the
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Palazzo
 
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
homophilus influenza vaccines will be
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
taken out
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
right that'll be correct
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
they'll even only code vaccines or the
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
and welcome back by the way thank you I
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused because my
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
understanding is this bill's intention
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
was to expand access to coveted
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and influenza like a lot of
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
other practitioners who don't
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
traditionally get vaccines were approved
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to do
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
and then what we're talking about now is
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
removing covert vaccination influenza is
 
01:16:10.729 --> 01:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
that is that correct no no no okay we're
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're maintaining influenza we're
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
removing covid
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay well so covid which was the primary
 
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.209 align:start position:0%
okay well so covid which was the primary
thing

01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so and both yeah
 
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so and both yeah
representative

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going back to the question that I
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
think representative Nagel had before
 
01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
where is the
 
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman when you look to
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
the original bill in Section 3 on line
 
01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:44.149 align:start position:0%
the original bill in Section 3 on line
15

01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
um it adds influenza covid-19 and
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
shingles vaccines which have been
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
approved by the Food and Drug
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
Administration to adults so the current
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill allows them to administer the
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
influenza covid-19 and shingles we're
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
doing a straw poll to see who would be
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
in favor of an amendment to strike just
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 from that line and to have
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
something similar to section Q from the
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
amendment but we we want to find out how
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
much wordsmithing needs to happen so
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
throw out the First Amendment completely
 
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:16.340 align:start position:0%
other than Q yep okay thanks
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
so representative I apologize
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
um uh um chairman
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic and where Pat
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
kind of passed the pandemic but we don't
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
we never know
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't covid wasn't it set up for the
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
optometrist to do this in the event that
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
they would have to give some coveted
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines to now all of a sudden not have
 
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
now you're saying to take out coveted
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify the position for
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
where we are the original bill
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
for those who were not here for the
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
original hearing
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
had influenza covid-19 and shingles and
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
all we are doing now is talking about a
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
straw poll
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
to find out whether it is worthwhile
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
to pursue an amendment of the sort that
 
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative whole is talking about I
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
wonder Mr chairman if it might be
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
simpler at this point because we don't
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
see it in front of us to Simply see if
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass motion might pass which
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
would get the whole thing taken care of
 
01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:37.100 align:start position:0%
but I do understand
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
the need for people to discuss other
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
Alternatives which is why I'm certainly
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
willing to go along with the straw poll
 
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.030 align:start position:0%
willing to go along with the straw poll
notion

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
notion
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
but after that I'm hoping that
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
will have a clearer Direction
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think that for some of us
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
the question is in between ought to pass
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
is amended versus itl but between ought
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
to pass or ought to pass is amended by
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
this potential that's why I said so yes
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that maybe we should go
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
with that shop Hall of who's interested
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
in pursuing that pathway
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and then we will know what to do
 
01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.430 align:start position:0%
um and then we will know what to do
representative

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh I want to add this little
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
presentative case question so this bill
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
has several parts and several
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
motivations it's uh today we learned
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
that originally it was motivated by
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
um by pandemic but when we were healing
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in here what the
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
optometrist testified that they don't
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
get requests for vaccine nobody asks
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
them if you can provide vaccine and they
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
also testified that they specifically
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
want shingles vaccines because shingles
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes related with a vision so it's
 
01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:00.739 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that the whole bill
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
based solely on covet vaccine
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you sir
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
just to make people aware of the fact is
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
when this was coming to us part of the
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
reason why the optometrist wanted to
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
give the be given the authority to
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
immunize was the fact that they wanted
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
to go to help out with the coveted
 
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
to go to help out with the coveted
clinics

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't because they had no
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
authority to give the vaccine or any
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine so that was one of the triggers
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
in which they wanted to at that point in
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
time come to here to legislative body
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
asking for permission to give the
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine so they could actually
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
participate in the covert vaccine
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
Immunization Clinics
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
there is moment afoot to incorporate the
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
code vaccine into influenza on an annual
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
basis so I'm not sure where that's going
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
to go if we take out the covid and we
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
leave them to have the influenza if they
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to get influenza
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
all by itself because that's what
 
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Community is doing it may
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
in essence negate them given the ability
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
to have the influenza because they won't
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
be available in the marketplace I don't
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
know where it's going to go but there's
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
been discussion by the manufacturing
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
Community to incorporate covet into the
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
influenza because they believe it's
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to be seasonal
 
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.950 align:start position:0%
going to be seasonal
yeah

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that Insight that actually
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
strengthens my support at this amendment
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
because of the state legislature who
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
puts forth the need for an industry to
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
keep a separate influenza vaccine I
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
think that that's a great benefit to
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
Public Health and individual choice so
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
ready for a stop hole those in favor of
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
some kind of an amendment along the
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
lines of Representative Hull's
 
01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:50.890 align:start position:0%
lines of Representative Hull's
discussion

01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:50.900 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
who's counting one two three one two
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
three four seven
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
so 7 2 13.
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weber
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
may I be recognized for a motion sure I
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
move out to pass as originally presented
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
to us on house bill Senate Bill rather
 
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.130 align:start position:0%
to us on house bill Senate Bill rather
200.

01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
200.
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
okay motions were made is there a second
 
01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.169 align:start position:0%
okay motions were made is there a second
okay

01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative three seconds
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
I represent Palazzo
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
I I'm very concerned about the original
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
about SB 200 uh specifically
 
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:48.610 align:start position:0%
about SB 200 uh specifically
um

01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:48.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.590 align:start position:0%
um
making

01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
motivation for optometrists to provide
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines we had testimony
 
01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines we had testimony
that

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
they are not concerned about possible
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
side effects of covid-19 vaccine if they
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
have a patient with
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
vision issues and maybe circulations in
 
01:23:19.689 --> 01:23:19.699 align:start position:0%
issues causing eye problems
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
from testimony it sounds like they never
 
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:26.540 align:start position:0%
asked if it was a result of
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury so and we are putting
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
them in a position where they will be
 
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
even less motivated due to financial and
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
another obligations in this situation
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
is so I'm very concerned about this bill
 
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.850 align:start position:0%
is so I'm very concerned about this bill
the

01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:55.460 align:start position:0%
alleged quantity of
 
01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
problems that followed the mass
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
administration of covid-19 vaccines
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
circulation related to this went up
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
blood related to this codes on top of in
 
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.430 align:start position:0%
blood related to this codes on top of in
heavily

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated communities such as
 
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm opposing to this bill as an
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
addiction thank you for the discussion
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
yeah as mentioned previously people have
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
said and I am up about free market free
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
will all of that the deal breaker in
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill for me is the covet 19.
 
01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
um because of I mean I voted previously
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
um you know on a bill that expanded
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
access and distribution of vaccines I
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
voted against that so I'm going to
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
continue to do that because of the
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
issues in particular that I've seen with
 
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
covet 19. I have many many friends and
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
family members who have had very severe
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions to this vaccine so for
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
if this wasn't if that wasn't in this
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
bill I would vote for it that the
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
mention of that particular vaccine is
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
why I will be voting against this thank
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Shapiro
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I am going to
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
be voting for ought to pass
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
which I am ambivalent about because I
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
don't see any great need to have
 
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:26.219 align:start position:0%
optometrists be giving vaccines right at
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
this point but I don't see any harm in
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
it either and I I would just say that
 
01:25:31.199 --> 01:25:32.810 align:start position:0%
it either and I I would just say that
I'm

01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
kind of frustrated and sad that we're
 
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
using this bill to relitigate the
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency and safety of the Kobe
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's it is it is already
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
available it is
 
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.410 align:start position:0%
available it is
um

01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:47.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
legal people have the choice whether to
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
take it or not
 
01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
take it or not
um

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
we're not changing any of that we're
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
really just saying that this this one
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
group of people who seem to be
 
01:26:01.139 --> 01:26:02.030 align:start position:0%
group of people who seem to be
um

01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
capable of doing it safely will be able
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
to give the vaccine as well as many
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
other people so
 
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.709 align:start position:0%
other people so
um

01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for it thank you
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Lange and then
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm glad that we have reached
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
the point where most people are not
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
forced to take the coveted vaccine
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
however people who are working under an
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
employment agreement that's mandated by
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
CMS still need to take it so I think
 
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that I think my
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
my largest concern with the bill as it
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
stands is the same one that we had on
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist with the RSV we need to
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
come back and figure out how to put
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
requirements for Vera's reporting and I
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
want to make that note that I see a
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant also nodding his
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
head this this is a bill that um
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'll likely have more support for the
 
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be likely drafted as
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
a Minority Report but I believe that
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
increasing this access is important so
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting for the bill is ought to
 
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
pass even if I may end up liking not to
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
pass as amended even more
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
um I've had an incredibly interesting
 
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
life I've gotten to practice medicine
 
01:27:15.649 --> 01:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
all over the world and places where I
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
did things I had absolutely no right
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
doing what I was doing but there was
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
nobody else there to do it so I did it
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
last I checked this is not that
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
environment one of my Fondest Memories
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
of childhood was getting allergy shots
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
um on every other week basis going into
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic shock and it's really
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
entertaining to have your throat close
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
and have your skin get all Itchy and
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
Scratchy and all sorts of stuff and
 
01:27:48.169 --> 01:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
being nine years old and having no clue
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
that you're about to die
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
but the good news was that my doctor
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
knew exactly what to do he grabbed some
 
01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
Epi threw it in me and the nice news was
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
that because it was in his own house I
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
had to stay for two hours after and I
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
developed a nice lifelong friendship
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
with his daughter who I played with
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
while I was recovering the moral of all
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
that story is that I really am
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
struggling with the level of confidence
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I have in certain people to manage
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
things like that it's nice to know that
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
I have a doctor that's been trained how
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do this not just taken a course and
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
be a basic life support or whatever and
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
never really experience it but actually
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
practice it under supervision on a
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
regular basis in real life circumstances
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm really struggling
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
with allowing interventions of this kind
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be done outside of the medical Realm
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
by people and I'm not totally convinced
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
or qualified to do it I think the other
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
thing is that if we had a clear
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
compelling Public Health reason to do
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
this then I would say fine we really
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
need to do what the risks out the
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
benefits outweigh the risk but I don't
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
think that case has been made and that's
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
why I'm not going to vote for this
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
oh the discussion
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman and then
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh McLean thank you Mr
 
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.770 align:start position:0%
representative uh McLean thank you Mr
chairman

01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm gonna use what you just said
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel as a springboard
 
01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
um to some concerns I have about the
 
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.370 align:start position:0%
um to some concerns I have about the
bill

01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
um when we did give the authorization to
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacists Pharmacy interns and
 
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians to administer
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to adults and a couple to
 
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.250 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to adults and a couple to
kids

01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
um we ensured that they would provide
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
proof of that additional instruction on
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
an injection technique and evaluation
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
and managing treatment of emergency
 
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.649 align:start position:0%
and managing treatment of emergency
reactions

01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
um to their board and I don't see any
 
01:29:44.410 --> 01:29:44.420 align:start position:0%
language that would require that here
 
01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:47.060 align:start position:0%
and it's also unclear to me whether
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
optometrists as part of their licensure
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
are required to maintain
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
um BLS
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
certification and and without it so if
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
anyone has the answer to that question
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to have it but those are
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
just a couple of concerns that I still
 
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
have about this and then of course the
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
the elephant the room is that the
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions are not being reported
 
01:30:11.890 --> 01:30:11.900 align:start position:0%
when they happen
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I'm I'm not sure
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
where I'm going to fall on this vote I'm
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
probably going to make it up and make up
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
my mind in a second before we do it
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
um again those con competing concerns
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
where I want to increase access to
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
things for people who want them but at
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
the same time are we ensuring that we're
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
having a level of education for these
 
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
people who are administering them that's
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you representative
 
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you representative
McLean

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I mean and I do have
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the bill but um I do
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
think it expands access and for me
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
um looking at it I don't think I think
 
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
an optometrist is as capable if not more
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
capable of administering the vaccines
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
than some of the drive up cattle lines
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we saw with respect to Covenant
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
Administration where it was impossible
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation it was really
 
01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
incredibly frustrating for me I ended up
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
not getting the vaccine and where I
 
01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
couldn't get access to my PCP to have it
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
done I would have appreciated this as an
 
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
alternative there will be training that
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
comes along with this and I don't know
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
that this solves all of the Bears
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
problem that we talked about last week
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
but I think there's probably going to be
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
more of a chance of compliance with the
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
optometrist than it would be in the
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
drive up cattle lines I don't think it
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
solved the problem I think we still have
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
more work to do with respect to that but
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
taken as a net negative and a net
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
positive I still feel that this
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is a net positive and so I
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
will be supporting it uh thank you Mr
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you of the discussion
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.510 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
[Music]

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
I wanted to follow up on reps of
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
cushman's comments and I think
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
the points are well stated and I'm going
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
back and looking at the requirements
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
placed on the pharmacist and you
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct the pharmacist
 
01:32:12.189 --> 01:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
actually has to demonstrate to the board
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
they have received the appropriate
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
training and in the training itself
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
talks about basic life support and
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
things of that nature which they have to
 
01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
things of that nature which they have to
maintain

01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
that is not the case at all with this
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill with the optometrist
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
so in saying that I would be willing to
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
sit down with representative Cushman and
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
possibly work on an amendment to this to
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
be sure that those requirements are
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually built into this as well because
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
it goes back to what Dr Nichol who
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
represent Nagel said you need to have
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
the training to deal with an emergency
 
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have that training um
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
just because you have some certification
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
and so forth you should demonstrate that
 
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
to the board that you're responsible to
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
which would be in this case the board of
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
photometry that you in fact have not
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
just passed the course but you have also
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
maintained bills BLS training and so
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
forth so I think it's an important point
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
having listened to this discussion for a
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
very long time I think that
 
01:33:10.739 --> 01:33:11.270 align:start position:0%
very long time I think that
um

01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
if the agreement
 
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
is that an amendment would be drafted
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
that deals solely with training and with
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
theirs reporting
 
01:33:24.129 --> 01:33:24.139 align:start position:0%
and not with any of the other stuff
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to withdraw my motion
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
if the second is willing to withdraw the
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
second and this could be addressed again
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
at a further meeting
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
and uh so there's a there's a yes
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative priest okay so continue
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
this then is that what I'm here and
 
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
oh we're going to go back to it in a
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
moment yeah we just went a little bit
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment uh Mr
 
01:33:58.739 --> 01:33:59.950 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment uh Mr
representative

01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead if I may I want to be sure
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
are you willing to work with me on the
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment absolutely thank you we'll be
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment from both representative
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or discussion
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh before we move on
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
so we're going to continue uh SV 200 to
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
moving back going back to 170 SB 171 uh
 
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:33.620 align:start position:0%
do I have a motion
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:34:36.179 --> 01:34:37.430 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
I

01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
I drafted an amendment uh based on some
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussions that we had may I pass that
 
01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:46.310 align:start position:0%
discussions that we had may I pass that
out

01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:57.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:34:57.490 --> 01:34:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
deals solely with the reference to
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
school-aged children
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
and you will remember that when we heard
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
the bill there was a proposal let me get
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
back to 171 that we incorporate by
 
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
reference a definition of school-aged
 
01:35:22.570 --> 01:35:22.580 align:start position:0%
children which occurs in RSA 170 colon 2
 
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
and what that definition is is uh
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
children four years and eight months of
 
01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:35.300 align:start position:0%
age or older and attending school
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so I I several people said to me
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
that there was a little concern about
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
that because it was in another place and
 
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
also uh there is the issue of of people
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
who are homeschooling and who uh might
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
want to take part in these programs so I
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
thought that the end attending school
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
might not be particularly helpful so all
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
the amendment does is it changes the
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
language which is now youth program for
 
01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
children six years of age or older to a
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
program for children four years and
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
eight months of age or older and that
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
way we allow for the younger children
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
which was what the initial concern was
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
the initial concern was out about
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
children who are already in kindergarten
 
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
but cannot participate in these programs
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
I thought that the four years and eight
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
months was just as good a cut off as any
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
and because there was concern about
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
having a definition about what we were
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
talking about I thought that this would
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
satisfy a bunch of needs and and would
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
not uh would give us guidances to the
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
lower ranges of who may attend these
 
01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
programs and what the exceptions are but
 
01:36:51.659 --> 01:36:52.870 align:start position:0%
programs and what the exceptions are but
without

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
include incorporating the School
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
attendance restriction which I thought
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
was a was not needed
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
so representative Weber you're moving
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
1455. beg your pardon I am indeed thank
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
you is there a second my second okay
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative three seconds any other
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
discussion on on this amendment
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
chairman my first thought was four years
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
eight months that's really young to go
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
to Boys and Girls Club then I did some
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
math and that's how old I was when I
 
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
started kindergarten yeah so I think I'm
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay with this and thank you very much
 
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
for bringing this amendment it provides
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
great clarity
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative Murphy
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah my mistaking I would thank you am I
 
01:37:39.129 --> 01:37:39.139 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I thought when we met last
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
that somebody mentioned RSA 170-e colon
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
2 actually defines that as four years
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
and eight months is that correct so
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
you're you're just taking that language
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
and put it into this amendment here what
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
we discussed when we actually had the
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
hearing was incorporating that statute
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
by reference and
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
somebody raised a question about using
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
that statute because it's actually the
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
definition of school age for completely
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
different purposes
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
and when I read it I also saw that it
 
01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.649 align:start position:0%
and when I read it I also saw that it
limited

01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
the definition to children who were
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
attending school and I thought that our
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
the original statute here that talked
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
about six years of age did not have that
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
limit in it and so I thought it might be
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
more prudent simply to drag over the
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
four years and eight months which gets
 
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
all of our kindergarten students in
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
without dragging over the Restriction
 
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
about how they are getting their
 
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.470 align:start position:0%
about how they are getting their
schooling

01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
schooling
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
um I it just seemed a cleaner way of
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
doing it thank you let's read that
 
01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
they say no the discussion uh the event
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
the emotion on the floor is ought to
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%

I I believe that there's an amendment do
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
you have that Amendment yet
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
this on the amendment representative or
 
01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:56.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment um to introduce amendment
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
1472-h to house or Senate bill 238. I
 
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
handed it out to everybody earlier
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh would you like me to speak to that
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
motion uh sure so you're moving out to
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
pass on 1472h I am is there a second to
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber seconds uh sure go
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
ahead to representative Murphy
 
01:42:17.639 --> 01:42:18.590 align:start position:0%
ahead to representative Murphy
um

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 238 is actually a very good
 
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
bill it um allows for a Telehealth
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
prescribing but it has a fairly narrow
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
Focus to mental health only
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
um a few weeks back we as a committee
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously House Bill 500 which
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
was allowing
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
prescribing of schedule two to four
 
01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.770 align:start position:0%
prescribing of schedule two to four
drugs

01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.629 align:start position:0%
drugs
um

01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
to a much broader range of patients to
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
put it in perspective you know the
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
number of patients that are
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
um having Telehealth appointments at
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
just DH alone are now over 1500 a day
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
were before the pandemic three years ago
 
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
was only about a dozen a day the
 
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
satisfaction among patients has been as
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
good if not better than with in person
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to travel
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
um as a result of the um pandemic that
 
01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:15.659 align:start position:0%
has increased substantially uh to where
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
a large number of patients now are
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
choosing to have Telehealth as their
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
preferred means to contact with their
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
Primary Care it also adds tremendous
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
access for our patients in addition to
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
convenience so what the amendment that I
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
put forward does is two things one it is
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
a simply a replace all of Senate Bill
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
238 with the language that was in House
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 500 with the addition of a
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
two Roman 5 D which deals with the
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
consent for a minor
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
as requested
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
um uh previously
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's important to understand that
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know that that Telehealth is really
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
here to stay in that the great majority
 
01:44:07.609 --> 01:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
of patients many of the patients prefer
 
01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:10.139 align:start position:0%
to have a Telehealth appointment
 
01:44:10.139 --> 01:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
to have a Telehealth appointment
um

01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
many appointments are done specifically
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
and only as a consultation or
 
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
conversation and a lot of appointments
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
are have very little Hands-On
 
01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.430 align:start position:0%
are have very little Hands-On
necessarily

01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.270 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that what's really
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
remarkable to me is that even in a
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
specialty like Orthopedics which you
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
would imagine is fairly Hands-On
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
examining joints and Etc many of those
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
appointments and follow-up appointments
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
can be done and can be done very well on
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
Telehealth particularly with given their
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
mobility issues
 
01:44:42.179 --> 01:44:42.950 align:start position:0%
mobility issues
um

01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
the great majority also of x-rays that
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
are done at Regional hospitals and now
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
interpreted 24 7 at DH and so you can
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
have your whole appointment whether it
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
be an x-ray and then an appointment to
 
01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
follow via Telehealth and in the people
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
that really benefit from this
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
tremendously and not only the people
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
with mental health issues but also those
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
with uh issues regarding palliative care
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
or hospice care that travel to and from
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
a hospital is really not only an
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
inconvenience but sometimes dangerous uh
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
post-op uh patients that have difficulty
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
with Mobility oftentimes all you really
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
need to do is check in with a Telehealth
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
appointment look at their wound on
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
Telehealth or talk to them over the
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
phone and say how you doing and if they
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
have no concerns then you move on
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and you can do other things that
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
happen in an appointment that you know
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
you would otherwise do in person so for
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
instance you know you may prescribe
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
physical therapy or occupational therapy
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
you may order a consult you may order an
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
X-ray or another study this can all be
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
done via Conversation Over Telehealth so
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
it is a blooming growing field in the
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
care of patients especially in a in a
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire which is fairly
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
Rural and getting here particularly in
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
the difficult winter months is a certain
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
advantage and even a safety concern for
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
many patients so the bottom line is that
 
01:46:07.129 --> 01:46:07.139 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we passed House Bill
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
500 uh unanimously 20 to nothing
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and this bill the amendment that I'm
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
putting forward is really a place all of
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
238 to expand the scope of practice of
 
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
Telehealth but also to provide some
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
language regarding consent for minors so
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
um that's where we are right now
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you have a discussion yes
 
01:46:34.129 --> 01:46:34.139 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so my understanding is that
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
all we've done is take what we already
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
passed and included the consent
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
provision would you speak to the
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
provision of the consent provision and
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
just tell us what it says really what it
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
says is that
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
um oral you need to obtain oral or
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
written consent from the patient and or
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
if the patient is a minor from the
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
patient's parent or Guardian unless
 
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
state or federal law allows a minor to
 
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
consent to treatment without the consent
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
of a parent or Guardian so it gives
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
Clarity to
 
01:47:09.490 --> 01:47:09.500 align:start position:0%
um consent for a minor
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
state and federal statute of laws
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
modifying as necessary
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
of a discussion
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative way on um thank you Mr
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for bringing this
 
01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for bringing this
amendment

01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I had actually looked at replacing
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
those sections around prescribing with
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
our language from House Bill 500 and I
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
really really appreciate you taking on
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
the consent Factor
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
um the as far as the consent goes this
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
is a very good step
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
um but I think that we still have some
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
existing problems around informed
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
consent that'll be beyond the scope of
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
this bill but I think that it's very
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
very important that we do serious work
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
to get appropriate definitions
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
guidelines and guardrails on confirm on
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
informed consent into the statutes so
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
that as we expand non-traditional
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
medicine and we have these appropriate
 
01:48:07.609 --> 01:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
consents we we make sure that people are
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
protected in this process I guess my
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
I do see in here that it says that um
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's obtained consent from the
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
patient or parent or Guardian only once
 
01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
um my only question around that is if
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's once for the entire course of
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
things or if you end up interacting with
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
them on a different
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
um on a different issue because maybe
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
you may be consenting with me about my
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
sprained wrist and I squeeze it for you
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
on camera so you know I'm not doing the
 
01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:38.060 align:start position:0%
long bone fracture scream
 
01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:41.219 align:start position:0%
but then we if we move into a different
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
topic I'm concerned about whether it be
 
01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.139 align:start position:0%
a notification if it's a change in scope
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
I would think you know I would agree
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
with that that if in fact you're really
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
obtaining consent to treat a particular
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
problem that a minor has so I think that
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
that probably is the scope it's not like
 
01:48:59.890 --> 01:48:59.900 align:start position:0%
once you provide a consent to treat
 
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
that it's for every episode of care that
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
goes forward even specifically in to
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
your point for a different problem
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
altogether so this is informed consent
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
specifically for the um
 
01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
in my mind for the um the problem at
 
01:49:13.739 --> 01:49:14.570 align:start position:0%
in my mind for the um the problem at
hand

01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
can I follow up to that thank you Mr
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that I know
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
that this is under a bit of a deadline
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
because the federal rules that allow it
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
I expire either May 11th to 13th so
 
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
um if if you were to write the committee
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
report would you be willing to discuss
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
that the intention is that it's only for
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
this particular scope and that any scope
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
of practice would change yes thank you
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
please tell the discussion
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yeah and just a
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
question I mean I like this because it
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
it takes 500 and makes it stronger but
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
in your experience just common practice
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to consent is that how
 
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
consent is understood today I think it
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
is but I you know I think to
 
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative lands our point is that
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
it should be implied that it is for a
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
blanket coverage when you first
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
establish a patient physician
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
relationship but that if we have a
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
consent for the operating room it's an
 
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
operating room consent for that
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
procedure that day not for um if I did a
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
total hip today it's not for fixing
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
their broken broken bone two two years
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
from now so it is you know that's my you
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
know interpretation and I think it's
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
always been the standard of care that
 
01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:27.890 align:start position:0%
always been the standard of care that
any

01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
um informed consent is done for the
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
procedure and or treatment that you are
 
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
um thank you for bringing this amendment
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
forward I agree it's Pro it's a good
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
step um I don't think that it quite
 
01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:46.910 align:start position:0%
step um I don't think that it quite
meets

01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
meets
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
um where the rubber meets the road it's
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
um strong enough I think you could put
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
in your report that it's for everything
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
on you know in one encounter and one
 
01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
problem but when this is implemented by
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
you know private medical facilities
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have the committee
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
report in front of them and I'm
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
concerned especially because this
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
started as a bill about mental health
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
treatment that we will have minors who
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
are meeting with a psychiatrist via
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and they get consent for
 
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
that first meeting and then you know at
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
the next one the psychiatrist says well
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
we should put you on these six
 
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
medications and now the chat they've
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
already gotten consent and they don't
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
need it again so I I see
 
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
um kind of a hole there and I won't be
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
able to support this amendment
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative uh
 
01:51:43.619 --> 01:51:45.169 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative uh
Shapiro

01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh on another issue I would like to
 
01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.490 align:start position:0%
uh on another issue I would like to
confirm

01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and remind people that this still
 
01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:53.629 align:start position:0%
um and remind people that this still
um

01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
this still requires a yearly in-person
 
01:51:56.699 --> 01:51:57.950 align:start position:0%
this still requires a yearly in-person
visit

01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
visit
 
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
it does it requires a first establishing
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
a patient um physician relationship and
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
then subsequently at least annually uh
 
01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:08.530 align:start position:0%
then subsequently at least annually uh
thereafter

01:52:08.530 --> 01:52:08.540 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
and also to remind us that this is
 
01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.649 align:start position:0%
and also to remind us that this is
really

01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
you know a bill specifically about
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
enhancing this is not a bill for
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
enhancing a physician's practice it's
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
not for enhancing Hospital's you know
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
ability to care you know you know
 
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
ability to bill for patient care
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
these patients need to care regardless
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
if they see a physician or a provider in
 
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
person what this bill really does and if
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
we we try to get to the root of it it's
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
a the core concept of the bill is to
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
basically provide access to care for
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
those people that
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
for for who getting to the hospital is a
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
not only difficult but also sometimes
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
dangerous and again this this provides
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
just another mechanism in which we can
 
01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
provide increased access but also
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate care to patients
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
1700 sounds like a lot of patients per
 
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
day getting you know Telehealth visits
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
but we're talking you know in
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
relationship to several tens of
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
thousands per day getting access to care
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
this would only be utilized
 
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
from a provider's perspective when it's
 
01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate to see a patient via
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
Telehealth uh it doesn't ease their
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
ability to take care of a patient they
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
still have to document they still have
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
to see the patient you know whether it's
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
in person or via Telehealth it just
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
provides an access in a means by which
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
patients can get safe and reliable and
 
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
in regards to the informed consent and I
 
01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:44.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe that parents should
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
consent to any kind of treatment
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
I would say that that's
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a complex and fuzzy area
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes when
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
when I had a private practice and I was
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
treating an adolescent I would
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
definitely get parental consent to do
 
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
that treatment and I would renew that
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
consent every year but I would not
 
01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.570 align:start position:0%
consent every year but I would not
necessarily

01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
unless it was clinically called for I
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
get consent again every time we talked
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
about a different issue and that um in
 
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
that child's life so I think it's um
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think the spirit of what we should aim
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
for is that we're absolutely having the
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
parents permission to be doing what
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're doing with a minor but I think
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a complex thing to um
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
Define in writing
 
01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel did you have a
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
question first of all I'm sorry the
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
little dazed here
 
01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.530 align:start position:0%
little dazed here
um

01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for bringing that
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
up um I was very concerned about the
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
people I represent that I've talked
 
01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
about a million times not being included
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
in this legislation I have a question I
 
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
think more than anything
 
01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:03.770 align:start position:0%
think more than anything
um

01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
so I do a lot of telemedicine for the
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
reasons that you said
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I would never ever make a major
 
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
change in my treatment plan without
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
physically seeing the person unless it
 
01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
was an extraordinary circumstance but I
 
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
was kind of looking through the
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislation somewhat to the medical
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
board rules and things like that to see
 
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
if that's in statute but I I did not see
 
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
it do you know if that exists that
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement or are we just
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
talking like ethics and best practice
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of anything written in
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
statute that specifies exactly when and
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
how often you have to have you know
 
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:40.910 align:start position:0%
how often you have to have you know
consent

01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
but I I would Echo and agree with your
 
01:55:48.169 --> 01:55:48.179 align:start position:0%
intent about informed consent and also
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I mean for us as
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
clinicians taking care of patients we
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
always you know get a obtained consent
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
from an adult for a procedure or from an
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
adult for the care of their child or
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
adolescents or their minor and that's
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
just the way we practice medicine and so
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
um you know that's the way I've always
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
practiced and I think that's what you
 
01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
always practice and we always would do
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
that if we ever made a major change to
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
their medication or their treatment or
 
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
procedures I mean you always get
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
informed consent from the custodian of
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
the the minor
 
01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:26.270 align:start position:0%
the the minor
um

01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
can I ask a follow-up
 
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry follow-up sure
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that I think is
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
a little confusing about telemedicine is
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's an audio or a visual
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
component and sometimes there's not
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's a dramatic difference between
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
the two in terms of follow-up care
 
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.830 align:start position:0%
the two in terms of follow-up care
um

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
should we be separating these two in
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
statute also and I I I'd like to respond
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
to that I think it is defined as both
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
audio and visual and I understand the
 
01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
concern you might have but I also think
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
about it from a clinical perspective if
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
I as a surgeon wanted to see the patient
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to check the wound I would
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
want to I would then insist that they
 
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
come and see me okay I think there's
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
certain ethical standards and there are
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
safeguards you know that are you know
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
um uh dictated by the Board of Medicine
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
and by our licensure
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think that's I wouldn't
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
say it's at the discretion of the
 
01:57:24.649 --> 01:57:24.659 align:start position:0%
position but on the other hand
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know as well you know as well as I
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
that if I had to see the patient
 
01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
physically present to either examine
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
them uh check a wound
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
um whatever it is that requires in
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
person I would insist on that even if
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily not the most convenient
 
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
thing for the patient but I would do
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
that anyway but as in oftentimes many of
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
our appointments with patients are
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
mostly conversational we are how you
 
01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
doing how's your range of motion what's
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
your pain level like right now what do
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
you need right now and that can be
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
handled so I I without further
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
handcuffing you know the clinical
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
practice which I think is always
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
intending to do the right by the patient
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
I would never you know not see a patient
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
if I was concerned about the wound I
 
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
would actually say you need to come in I
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at this so I'm not
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
sure separating them out would
 
01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:15.179 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh do anything but add
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
further confusion to the bill
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:19.609 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
okay

01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
I've got several points to make the
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
first one being that we already passed
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
every single thing that's in this bill
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
except for the consent piece
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
um we have had over the years
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
discussions about
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:40.810 align:start position:0%
 
Visual

01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:40.820 align:start position:0%
Visual
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
Communications and
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
I think the thing to remember about this
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
bill is it's not relieving Physicians
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
and I think people have touched on this
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
but we're not relieving Physicians of
 
01:58:56.450 --> 01:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
any of their obligations of practice
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
by doing this we are simply giving them
 
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
more tools and so if a physician God
 
01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
forbid is using it inappropriately there
 
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
are disciplinary
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
tracts of various sorts flawed but
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
they're there
 
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
to help with that so
 
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
um what we're doing is
 
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
keeping everybody's standards as they
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
are we have made if we adopt this
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
amendment the consent marginally clearer
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
and yes it is fuzzy but it's marginally
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
clearer if we adopt this and otherwise
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're just giving
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
medical professionals a tool at a time
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
when we very much need it and I will say
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
as somebody who lived with a husband
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
with metastatic bone disease for four
 
01:59:48.179 --> 01:59:51.770 align:start position:0%
with metastatic bone disease for four
years

01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
if I'd had to drive him from my home
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
then in Brattleboro Vermont to Dartmouth
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock for treatment he would have
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
died in Year One
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
because he would not have been able to
 
02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
take the pain of the transport
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
caused the hospital was 10 minutes away
 
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
we could get him there for every single
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
treatment he needed
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
but on the days when he did not need a
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
shot or an infusion it would have been
 
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
such a relief
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
not to have had to haul him physically
 
02:00:32.050 --> 02:00:32.060 align:start position:0%
out to the car haul him out of the car
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
haul him into the doctor's office to
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
have a conversation
 
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
just would have been an incredible
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
blessing to have this in place so I urge
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the amendment I have
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
urged the adoption of the whole bill and
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
I hope that it will be concurred with
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
and moving on its way to the governor
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
before the deadline
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
um well I I agree and I I support SB 500
 
02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
as it was written because I think it was
 
02:01:06.649 --> 02:01:06.659 align:start position:0%
almost better to be silent on this
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
consent and just stick with the current
 
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
laws as they are and in this amendment
 
02:01:14.089 --> 02:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
having this oral or written consent
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and you know this clause on line 27
 
02:01:18.649 --> 02:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
and the other one for the nurse
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
practitioners we're opening it up to
 
02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
where consent won't be required for
 
02:01:28.010 --> 02:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
minors by their by their parents or from
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
their parents for minors
 
02:01:32.209 --> 02:01:32.219 align:start position:0%
um I almost I I would I would support
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment without d
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
because that last sentence for services
 
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
delivered through on an ongoing basis
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
the practitioner need obtained consent
 
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
from the patient or parent or Guardian
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
only wants we already have laws that
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
require consent for treatment of minors
 
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
except in very specific circumstances
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that those are strong and
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they're clear and this opens to
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
opens things up to a lot of nuance thank
 
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant I'm sorry
 
02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:05.450 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant I'm sorry
huh

02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
huh
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
help me understand when I look at this
 
02:02:11.649 --> 02:02:11.659 align:start position:0%
issue of consent
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
how is this different using telemedicine
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
from an in-person visit because if you
 
02:02:20.089 --> 02:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
have an in-person visit
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't deal with in person
 
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
it deals with telemedicine so is there a
 
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
difference between what we're doing here
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
under telemedicine versus what would
 
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
happen if they came in person I'm not
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
aware that there's a difference thank
 
02:02:31.199 --> 02:02:32.649 align:start position:0%
aware that there's a difference thank
you

02:02:32.649 --> 02:02:32.659 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:32.659 --> 02:02:34.189 align:start position:0%
you
representative

02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
um Leon and then representative Weber
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
um I I was looking at this and looking
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
at the potential to have a section e to
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
schedule an in-person encounter
 
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
following any major change in treatment
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
but I'm almost wondering if standing
 
02:02:52.129 --> 02:02:52.139 align:start position:0%
with our position on House Bill 500
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
makes more sense if the existing
 
02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
informed consent stance
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
so that that that is my question there
 
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
because I do like having more consent
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
for for for children but I I do
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
I do agree with representative Cushman
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
that perhaps this actually lowers the
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
bar as opposed to going with what we
 
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
already have and I without a deep dive
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
into this consent section I I don't want
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
to potentially dilute the protections we
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
already have in place okay
 
02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative mazura
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to alert the committee
 
02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.850 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to alert the committee
that

02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:33.250 --> 02:03:33.260 align:start position:0%
the consent provision was to
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of the Senate's
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
language on 238 that I think I was under
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
the impression that everybody thought
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
was good but in the event that this
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
amendment is voted down I have another
 
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that is just 500 as we passed
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
it so it's available to us if this
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment goes thank you representative
 
02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
amendment goes thank you representative
mazura

02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
mazura
 
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
yeah my concern too is what others have
 
02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:03.290 align:start position:0%
yeah my concern too is what others have
said

02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
um is section D specifically the minute
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
this came before me I underlined it
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
immediately was the you know consent
 
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
from patient or a parent regarding only
 
02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:15.169 align:start position:0%
from patient or a parent regarding only
once

02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:15.179 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
so that to me sounds like a blanket
 
02:04:18.719 --> 02:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
so that to me sounds like a blanket
consent

02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
instead of per diagnosis consent which
 
02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
diagnoses can change drastically and so
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
does that consent just one off just
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
blanket right through the whole thing
 
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's my big concern with that one that
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
particular line
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I I can't vote for this with that
 
02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
line in there
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you of the discussion
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
the representative Cushman I would be
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
um support representative Weber's other
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment after taking a look at it and
 
02:04:57.850 --> 02:04:57.860 align:start position:0%
if it is just SB 500 straightforward
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
replacing eight HB thank you
 
02:05:03.970 --> 02:05:03.980 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh yes it was brought up about you know
 
02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
the some of the safeguards and you know
 
02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
for prescribing medications for minors
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
or otherwise and I just want to remind
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
us all that there are multiple
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
safeguards in effect already when
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
prescribing medications not only the DEA
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
requirements that we all have in our
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
prescribing practices
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
um standard of care and our DEA
 
02:05:29.099 --> 02:05:30.709 align:start position:0%
um standard of care and our DEA
licensure

02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
um we have in the here a stipulation
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to be seen at least once a year but
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but we also have in the
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire the New Hampshire
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um prescription drug monitoring program
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
which really does electronically monitor
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
all the medications that are prescribed
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
and if there's any particular red flags
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
they will be alerted to
 
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
um either the the provider in or the
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine so there there are a
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
lot of safeguards in place regarding
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
prescribing of these medications in the
 
02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.570 align:start position:0%
prescribing of these medications in the
state

02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative
 
02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
Merchant if I could follow up
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
to the issue I raised before
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
if this is the same
 
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:12.179 align:start position:0%
requirement for in-person versus
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
telemedicine why do we need it in the
 
02:06:21.609 --> 02:06:21.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative I think it came up
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
because there was language in the
 
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
original bill that was concerning about
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
consent and so that was well-intentioned
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
there was no concern in the original
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
House bill 500.
 
02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
incorporation of this consent provision
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
came from the language of Senate Bill
 
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
238 and I just wanted to be sure that we
 
02:07:04.810 --> 02:07:04.820 align:start position:0%
were all clear on that
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Shapiro
 
02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you can I suggest that we take a
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
straw poll about which amendment it
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
sounds like everyone's in favor of this
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
bill generally and can I suggest that we
 
02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
just take a straw poll about which
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
amendment people would prefer
 
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
and that sounds fine to me
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the Quran I'm
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead representative Murphy not
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this will change anybody's
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
mind or not but I I understand that the
 
02:07:34.729 --> 02:07:34.739 align:start position:0%
Senate has passed
 
02:07:36.649 --> 02:07:36.659 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 500 with the amendment
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's already Incorporated here
 
02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:41.270 align:start position:0%
that's already Incorporated here
so

02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.070 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
representative

02:07:45.070 --> 02:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:51.050 --> 02:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.729 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
okay do we still want to stop hole yes
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
okay so all those in favor of the
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendment before us right now please
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor uh
 
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of what
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is talking about
 
02:08:15.169 --> 02:08:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
because that would be the more popular
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
the more support
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
would it be sensible simply to proceed
 
02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
to a vote on this amendment and see I
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%

from the house with the consent
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment which the chair felt strongly
 
02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
about to cover the belt and suspenders I

02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh if the house my question is if the
 
02:13:17.810 --> 02:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
house sends something different uh back
 
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
to the Senate
 
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
I think do we miss the time frame to
 
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
catch that May 11th date that's my
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair thank you and that
 
02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
is a very good question so
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
um that was a committee vote in the
 
02:13:32.689 --> 02:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
Senate so they have adopted an amendment
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
but they haven't taken it to the floor
 
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
um as co-equal bodies if we take this
 
02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
amendment to the floor we then as a
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
whole body will vote on it and so we
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
will see we see we're following the
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
process through with both sides I
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
understand the time frame and the need
 
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
but we also want to make sure that we're
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
making the right legislation
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you madam
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
chair the other thing is that either of
 
02:13:57.770 --> 02:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
these will be voted on by of the floor
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
by the full body full Senator Full House
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
it will then go back to the other body
 
02:14:05.689 --> 02:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
either for concurrence or for committee
 
02:14:07.490 --> 02:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
of conference if they differ
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
and at that point uh the two bodies
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
together are in control of the time
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
frame but
 
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:15.649 align:start position:0%
frame but
um

02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's going to be the same
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
question either way
 
02:14:24.649 --> 02:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
it's just going in different directions
 
02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
if we have one house version and if the
 
02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
pass two different versions
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for a committee
 
02:14:38.209 --> 02:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
of conference there's the opportunity to
 
02:14:39.890 --> 02:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
Concur and simply send it to the
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
governor or there's the opportunity to
 
02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
non-concur and let something die and
 
02:14:47.209 --> 02:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
that happens every single time uh yes
 
02:14:49.729 --> 02:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my raising
 
02:14:51.649 --> 02:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
question purely for the time
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
considerations understanding that that
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
co-equal branches can approach things
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
how they choose and just trying to
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
figure out the dovetailing of it if the
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
policy is in fact favorable of both
 
02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
bodies Madam chair point of clarity for
 
02:15:04.139 --> 02:15:04.970 align:start position:0%
bodies Madam chair point of clarity for
myself

02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:15:08.089 --> 02:15:08.099 align:start position:0%
um so this amendment you
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber you said had
 
02:15:13.609 --> 02:15:13.619 align:start position:0%
five HP 500 language in it without
 
02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
though the amendment that do we and we
 
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
don't know what the amendment is at the
 
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:20.689 align:start position:0%
don't know what the amendment is at the
moment

02:15:20.689 --> 02:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
because it just passed this morning uh
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative I I'm under the
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
impression that it was the exact same
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
language that we saw in the in the
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
amendment introduced by representative
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
Murphy and that that was intended to
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
streamline the process
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
um however what I'm seeing here is that
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
this committee was while we appreciated
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
the idea of the informed consent
 
02:15:42.649 --> 02:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
um is not and was not in favor of that
 
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we're looking now to see if
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
we want to State the house position of
 
02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 500
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
um and if this is something that will be
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
adopted by this committee if it is then
 
02:15:56.930 --> 02:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
that also sends a signal that this
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole did not adopt the
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
informed consent provision and believes
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
that the existing law already covers
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
this use case
 
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I I know I personally appreciate the
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
Senate's attempt to do this informed
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
consent is something that should always
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
be approved improved upon but I'm just
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced that this is an
 
02:16:15.169 --> 02:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
improvement which is why I did not
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
support that Amendment even though quite
 
02:16:19.010 --> 02:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
honestly at first glance I thought it
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
was going to be fantastic but that's why
 
02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
we have these sessions so we can discuss
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
so has anybody had a chance to look
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
through my my internet was loading
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
slowly is this the same as House Bill
 
02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:31.790 align:start position:0%
slowly is this the same as House Bill
500

02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
okay so um would you like to speak to
 
02:16:36.589 --> 02:16:36.599 align:start position:0%
your motion representative Weber solely
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
to say that it was my instruction to OLS
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
to Simply substitute House Bill 500 as
 
02:16:45.610 --> 02:16:45.620 align:start position:0%
adopted by the house in its entirety so
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
I hope people have had a chance to check
 
02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
and make sure that was done I didn't
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
because I was trusting to representative
 
02:16:53.639 --> 02:16:55.429 align:start position:0%
because I was trusting to representative
Murphy's

02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
Murphy's
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
motion but
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I hope this
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
be favorable
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:14.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:20.099 align:start position:0%
I was not on this committee as a member
 
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
or a sub at the time but it does look
 
02:17:26.089 --> 02:17:26.099 align:start position:0%
from the docket that HB 500 passed on
 
02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
consent right 20-0 out of the house and
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
then a lot of the committee and then on
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
consent so I think there's a very well
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
established position for this
 
02:17:37.009 --> 02:17:37.019 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much representative
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
yes it did it did go through quite well
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
because we see this need
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the Senate trying to
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
expand the coverage but I know that I'm
 
02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
personally not quite ready for that
 
02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:49.129 align:start position:0%
personally not quite ready for that
myself

02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:17:49.139 --> 02:17:50.030 align:start position:0%
myself
um

02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess um if we're ready we can ask
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%

the consent calendar

02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
vote glass
 
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
um should I be voting last when I'm
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
presiding that's a good question I'm
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
sorry about that yeah not a problem
 
02:20:54.889 --> 02:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for the correction okay
 
02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:02.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.300 --> 02:21:11.469 align:start position:0%
 
objects

02:21:11.469 --> 02:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
oh yeah no
 
02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
so a representative Weber I had you on
 
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
the committee report on 171 and I think
 
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
on 87
 
02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:25.929 align:start position:0%
on 87
um

02:21:25.929 --> 02:21:25.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
I am on
 
02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:34.150 align:start position:0%
I am on
171.

02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
and I am also yes I'm 187 that's correct
 
02:21:41.889 --> 02:21:41.899 align:start position:0%
so I got three okay
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
would you like to do this one or would
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
you like somebody else to write it okay
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
fantastic just didn't want to overburden
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:21:55.250 --> 02:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I would have to check on what we're
 
02:22:01.929 --> 02:22:01.939 align:start position:0%
allowed to do for a um
 
02:22:04.730 --> 02:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
about discussion of what's going on in
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
the other body I don't think I can
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into a
 
02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:09.309 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into a
um

02:22:09.309 --> 02:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
into a um blurb so I think I just have
 
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
to say that what we've done is we've
 
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
simply taken what we believe to be the
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
better bill which is already the
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
position of the house and send it back
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the Senate that way and that we've
 
02:22:28.730 --> 02:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed our position perhaps thank
 
02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:33.830 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed our position perhaps thank
you

02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
I know that numerically 239 would be
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
next but chairman McDonald needed to
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
step out of the room I do know that
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
there are some moving pieces on House
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 240 so I didn't know if we wanted
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
to take up 240 next to at least start
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
discussing before we have a motion to
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
understand the landscape representative
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
Weber would that make sense
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
um I think we're in the same position
 
02:22:59.929 --> 02:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
with either of them but
 
02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
um uh the if I may speak to 240
 
02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:06.590 align:start position:0%
um uh the if I may speak to 240
um

02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as it came to us was confusing
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I personally had a significant
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
amount of difficulty understanding
 
02:23:19.210 --> 02:23:19.220 align:start position:0%
exactly what the purpose of the bill was
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
because as you may have remembered I
 
02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
said at the time normally we think of a
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
patient as being able to consent for
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
treatment to whatever they want to
 
02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
consent to providing they have informed
 
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
consent to providing they have informed
consent

02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and I thought that what I was hearing
 
02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
was that this bill was needed because
 
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
they were prohibited from doing that and
 
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
after a significant amount of back and
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
forth I think we have reached the
 
02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
conclusion that yes they can but more
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
clarity would be helpful
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh the second thing that happened is
 
02:23:57.840 --> 02:23:59.210 align:start position:0%
uh the second thing that happened is
that

02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
there were Provisions added to the bill
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the Senate that dealt with clinical
 
02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
research and
 
02:24:11.929 --> 02:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
um I think what emerged in talking to
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
various people was a notion that the
 
02:24:17.809 --> 02:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
there is a significant difference
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
between your consent
 
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:21.770 align:start position:0%
between your consent
to

02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh sharing of certain sensitive
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
information for treatment of your own
 
02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:27.070 align:start position:0%
information for treatment of your own
condition

02:24:27.070 --> 02:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
and to uses for research and that people
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
might want to have a greater
 
02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:36.429 align:start position:0%
might want to have a greater
um

02:24:36.429 --> 02:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
a greater clarity about the differences
 
02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
between those two things and the
 
02:24:43.969 --> 02:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consent to them one at a
 
02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
time so that you might want to consent
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
to one you might not want to consent to
 
02:24:49.610 --> 02:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
um I've had discussions with Mr hood and
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
various other people about what that
 
02:24:59.809 --> 02:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
language might be but we haven't reached
 
02:25:02.809 --> 02:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
the language yet so if if that's a
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
concept that people would like to
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
consider that's great
 
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
um the suggestion I made to the chair
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
was that because 240 is not an early
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill was that he appoint an official
 
02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittee not an informal
 
02:25:21.969 --> 02:25:21.979 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so that it had
 
02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
a actual hearing notices in the calendar
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
because this isn't due till June 1st and
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
that way we would be sure that everybody
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
who wants a bite at the pie not just the
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
people that I happen to be calling would
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
get their say but that is up to the
 
02:25:40.490 --> 02:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
chair so
um

02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's as far as I've gotten okay thank
 
02:25:45.290 --> 02:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Weber
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
that's a really good landscape and
 
02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
that's actually pretty similar from with
 
02:25:51.530 --> 02:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
the discussions that I've had as well I
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
guess seeing that it's quarter till noon
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
and that the Chairman's in another
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee perhaps we want people to
 
02:25:58.250 --> 02:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
think about whether they'd want to
 
02:25:59.450 --> 02:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
participate in that official
 
02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as far as the members of
 
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
this committee go perhaps we should
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
break for lunch until one o'clock and
 
02:26:08.090 --> 02:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
then we can um officially it's
 
02:26:10.490 --> 02:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
officially open that executive
 
02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:11.389 align:start position:0%
officially open that executive
um

02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
well it wouldn't be an opening an
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
executive session if this if the chair
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
chooses to appoint a subcommittee the
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
chair May simply do it without input for
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
many of us okay
 
02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but I hope he would ask about
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
interest and I know knowing the chair
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
that he would so that's something that
 
02:26:30.770 --> 02:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
we can do when we come back from lunch
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock yeah does that sound good
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
to everybody
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
then with that we will recess this um
 
02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
executive session until one o'clock
 
03:38:41.210 --> 03:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay back from lunch and uh
 
03:38:49.610 --> 03:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
way we go so um uh it looks like there's
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
two bills left that at least for today
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
for us to look at uh one of them has
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
some amendments pending and the sponsor
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
of those amendments said to him go to
 
03:39:01.130 --> 03:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
the state house so we'll um we'll wait
 
03:39:02.330 --> 03:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
on that a bit
 
03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
so why don't we go to everyone's
 
03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
favorite and the long anticipated
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um since this is
 
03:39:17.929 --> 03:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
such a big Wild and Woolly topic as a
 
03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
whole are we just going to have just a
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about points at this point
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
before bringing anything formally that's
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
fine sure
 
03:39:27.729 --> 03:39:27.739 align:start position:0%
kind of a kind of a groundbreaker or
 
03:39:30.170 --> 03:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
Icebreaker so to speak
 
03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of concerns
 
03:39:34.190 --> 03:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
understandably so it's a huge issue Mr
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative Missouri what
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
are we doing with 240
 
03:39:40.429 --> 03:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh that looks like it's going to be uh
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
this is we're going to put a
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee together okay and um so
 
03:39:45.290 --> 03:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
we'll wait till they get back is that
 
03:39:47.210 --> 03:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
the okay well not we don't have to wait
 
03:39:49.610 --> 03:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
on that one until they get back
 
03:39:49.620 --> 03:39:50.809 align:start position:0%
on that one until they get back
oh

03:39:50.809 --> 03:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:39:52.969 --> 03:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
okay so are we done with that one then
 
03:39:55.190 --> 03:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh for the time being uh are you
 
03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
interested in serving on a subcommittee
 
03:39:58.969 --> 03:39:58.979 align:start position:0%
for that one or yeah okay representative
 
03:40:01.450 --> 03:40:01.460 align:start position:0%
Weber you would like to okay
 
03:40:04.969 --> 03:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
okay so um and the average subcommittee
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
is I know it doesn't have a specific it
 
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
can be three or five
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be in in
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
proportional to representation so it
 
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
probably ought to be even at this point
 
03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:20.570 align:start position:0%
probably ought to be even at this point
um

03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay so representative lay on
 
03:40:25.010 --> 03:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weber anyone else want to
 
03:40:26.570 --> 03:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
be on that
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
we can settle it right now if we want
 
03:40:29.040 --> 03:40:33.429 align:start position:0%
we can settle it right now if we want
um

03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant wants to be
 
03:40:37.849 --> 03:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
on it I wasn't sure if representative
 
03:40:39.889 --> 03:40:39.899 align:start position:0%
Nagel has spoken to whether he wants to
 
03:40:43.849 --> 03:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
be on that okay or we can wait then
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
all right so I do please remember that
 
03:40:48.290 --> 03:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be
 
03:40:49.490 --> 03:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
reporting oh sure
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
so we well we have three Democrats right
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
now so we need three Republicans
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weber oh I'm sorry I'm
 
03:40:59.690 --> 03:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
sorry you're not a Democrat are you no
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not long ago
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
well I wasn't counting him yet I wasn't
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
sure that he was um definitely wanted to
 
03:41:10.490 --> 03:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
be all right so yeah we need one more
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
Democrat and we need um
 
03:41:15.170 --> 03:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
two more Republicans so okay we can talk
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
about that more one well if
 
03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:20.870 align:start position:0%
about that more one well if
we

03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:23.150 --> 03:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
we've already got three so we'll just go
 
03:41:25.969 --> 03:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
to four that's fine too I mean I I don't
 
03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be a huge committee uh
 
03:41:28.620 --> 03:41:29.330 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be a huge committee uh
for

03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for my purposes what needs to
 
03:41:35.150 --> 03:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
happen is we simply need to have a
 
03:41:37.969 --> 03:41:37.979 align:start position:0%
formal committee subcommittee so that
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
notice can be put in the calendar of a
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting so that all of the
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
parties who are interested in that bill
 
03:41:47.690 --> 03:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
can come and be heard all at the same
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
time so that we know that everybody's
 
03:41:54.769 --> 03:41:54.779 align:start position:0%
getting their say-in and we also uh know
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
that it's being done in a timely fashion
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
and not hardly with sort of email
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
messages back and forth for this coming
 
03:42:04.729 --> 03:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
upcoming calendar or
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh that's up to you Mr chairman um it
 
03:42:10.849 --> 03:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
can be done for the upcoming calendar or
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
it could be done it depends on when you
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
want to hold our next meeting well I I
 
03:42:17.870 --> 03:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
wanna I was thinking of continuing every
 
03:42:19.250 --> 03:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
Wednesday until we get our work done
 
03:42:19.260 --> 03:42:20.990 align:start position:0%
Wednesday until we get our work done
okay

03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I I'd make a suggestion then
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee to wait until the
 
03:42:28.969 --> 03:42:28.979 align:start position:0%
following week um so that everybody will
 
03:42:30.849 --> 03:42:30.859 align:start position:0%
be able to be there and we can focus on
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
these bills um to figure out where we
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
are if any of the others need
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittees or not well my suggestion
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
would be that the subcommittee meets
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
well before the committee meets
 
03:42:44.690 --> 03:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
so that we can get whatever we need for
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
I mean it can't be the same day
 
03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
so yes I I agree to that um what I was
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
saying was the other bills that we're
 
03:42:56.090 --> 03:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
pushing forward the question would be if
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
we were going to look to schedule any of
 
03:42:59.809 --> 03:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
those next week to work on them or if
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
we'd be moving further forward well but
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
the chair just said that we were going
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
to meet every week until we finished our
 
03:43:07.849 --> 03:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
business so I thought that answered that
 
03:43:07.859 --> 03:43:09.670 align:start position:0%
business so I thought that answered that
question

03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:12.050 --> 03:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that we meet sooner
 
03:43:15.170 --> 03:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
than Wednesday for the subcommittee on 2
 
03:43:15.180 --> 03:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
than Wednesday for the subcommittee on 2
40.

03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
40.
 
03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting first of all it has to be
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
calendared so we have to get it into the
 
03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:22.490 align:start position:0%
calendared so we have to get it into the
calendar

03:43:22.490 --> 03:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:43:25.309 --> 03:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh if it's next Wednesday I can't meet
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday because I'm not going to
 
03:43:28.849 --> 03:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
be here next Wednesday
 
03:43:31.070 --> 03:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
um it could be from my perspective
 
03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week or later in the week
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then taken up either that week or
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
um and that is one of the participants
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
on that I would be available Tuesday if
 
03:43:45.290 --> 03:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
we could find time frame so maybe we can
 
03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
although that I don't know if that's too
 
03:43:51.250 --> 03:43:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not persuaded that I I think it
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
probably if everybody comes and speaks
 
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
their mind at that subcommittee as
 
03:44:04.729 --> 03:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
opposed to later on I think I think we
 
03:44:06.530 --> 03:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
could be done and I have made it very
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
clear that my own position is that if we
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't come to a very solid agreement
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
that satisfies everybody either for a
 
03:44:19.969 --> 03:44:19.979 align:start position:0%
smaller piece or a larger piece that my
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to either retain the
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill or or
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
itl it all together
 
03:44:29.690 --> 03:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
so I think that next week is fine and I
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
will I'm just checking calendar right
 
03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:32.389 align:start position:0%
will I'm just checking calendar right
now

03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:44:35.090 --> 03:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
um that would be May 2nd yes that would
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
be May 2nd
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I'd be available after 10 o'clock
 
03:44:41.690 --> 03:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
that day I too would be available after
 
03:44:44.170 --> 03:44:44.180 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock that day maybe we should
 
03:44:46.729 --> 03:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
we'll see about finding us a space for
 
03:44:55.090 --> 03:44:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.769 --> 03:44:57.779 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that representative Leon is
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to be the first named on that
 
03:45:01.490 --> 03:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah I would I would say
 
03:45:03.650 --> 03:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
okay I would say
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
um we do we know if representative
 
03:45:07.250 --> 03:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
Merchant representative Nagel do want to
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know he does want to serve right for
 
03:45:12.479 --> 03:45:13.190 align:start position:0%
you know he does want to serve right for
sure

03:45:13.190 --> 03:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:45:15.410 --> 03:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I think representative Nagel works
 
03:45:18.050 --> 03:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
on Tuesdays he does
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe our next step is to see
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
if they can find us a room for Tuesday
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
while we see it the other members are
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
available the other thing is that you
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
could appoint a subcommittee of Two And
 
03:45:46.450 --> 03:45:46.460 align:start position:0%
if other people want to help out
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel doesn't he
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
um does any
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
late in the afternoon there's even more
 
03:45:59.469 --> 03:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
when they come back we can flush out the
 
03:46:04.010 --> 03:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
membership when they come back
 
03:46:06.170 --> 03:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
well yeah we can we can
 
03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
Christine we can schedule a subcommittee
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
right and determine the membership later
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we do that then so
 
03:46:25.370 --> 03:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:27.769 --> 03:46:27.779 align:start position:0%
you said after 10 o'clock so we would be
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
available at 10 o'clock could we do it
 
03:46:32.150 --> 03:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
at 10 30. sure because we have a nine
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
o'clock meeting and I don't know how
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's 10 30 sounds wonderful so far we
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee of two and that may
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
be expanding but we'll we'll talk to the
 
03:46:43.190 --> 03:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
other two when they get get here
 
03:46:43.200 --> 03:46:44.750 align:start position:0%
other two when they get get here
okay

03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
anything else on 240
 
03:46:52.969 --> 03:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on to 263 then
 
03:46:52.979 --> 03:46:54.050 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on to 263 then
um

03:46:54.050 --> 03:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just open it up for discussion uh
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the the bulk of the discussion
 
03:47:01.610 --> 03:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the debate
 
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
um it's focused on a sunset or no sunset
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
or along a sunset representative Leon
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I
 
03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
I recognize that this bill is almost
 
03:47:16.250 --> 03:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what we passed in House Bill 2
 
03:47:18.170 --> 03:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
except that bill has a Sunset and this
 
03:47:20.450 --> 03:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
one does not the commission that is in
 
03:47:22.250 --> 03:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
there is exactly the same in House Bill
 
03:47:25.190 --> 03:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
2 everything except for either repealing
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
the chapter law that enables Medicaid
 
03:47:27.720 --> 03:47:29.269 align:start position:0%
the chapter law that enables Medicaid
expansion

03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
um or the two-year Sunset which we have
 
03:47:34.429 --> 03:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill too so
 
03:47:36.650 --> 03:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple different points to
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
discuss on this bill one is what's the
 
03:47:40.610 --> 03:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
correct Sunset
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
um personally as far as I'm concerned
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that that debate is
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the house bill to
 
03:47:48.769 --> 03:47:48.779 align:start position:0%
budget discussion about where everybody
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
eventually settles on a Sunset date and
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
having two moving pieces at the same
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
time gets to be pretty complicated so I
 
03:47:59.690 --> 03:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
personally like the idea of leaving the
 
03:48:03.290 --> 03:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
sunset discussion to the budget there's
 
03:48:05.690 --> 03:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
other issues too this bill brings a
 
03:48:07.969 --> 03:48:07.979 align:start position:0%
permanent Medicaid expansion that uses
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
statute that includes sections that say
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
until this date in 2019 the department
 
03:48:17.210 --> 03:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
shall so there's lots of old language
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's other language that right now
 
03:48:22.190 --> 03:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
they're not able to enforce because they
 
03:48:23.809 --> 03:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
had sought waivers at different times
 
03:48:25.610 --> 03:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
there had been a ruling on the work
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
requirement and this unlimited Medicaid
 
03:48:31.969 --> 03:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
expansion Bill really brings up the
 
03:48:33.889 --> 03:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
question that we need to discuss what's
 
03:48:36.170 --> 03:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
happening with this bill what this
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
program should actually look like
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
looking to update the language to make
 
03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
sure that it actually reflects what this
 
03:48:45.050 --> 03:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
state wants and not to just go ahead and
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
Roll It Forward for a very long time
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
period without bringing up these really
 
03:48:51.769 --> 03:48:51.779 align:start position:0%
big and really important questions just
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
as far as one goes we've discussed with
 
03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability Community
 
03:48:58.729 --> 03:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
how important it is to be able to work
 
03:49:01.130 --> 03:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
because when you work you participate
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
you build self-worth you you have a lot
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
of benefits that come from it and the
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
fact that we have the work requirement
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
now non-enforceable and Medicaid
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
expansion is a problem because
 
03:49:16.190 --> 03:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
there are within that there is
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions when medically you can't work
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
or there's other reasons why you can't
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
work but your average person should
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
your average person should be would be
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
pursuing a job and a career and I'm
 
03:49:30.290 --> 03:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
worried about this whole language about
 
03:49:31.969 --> 03:49:31.979 align:start position:0%
your average able-bodied person should
 
03:49:33.290 --> 03:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
be working when we're trying to make
 
03:49:35.150 --> 03:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
sure that your average person who's not
 
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
quite as advantaged is also working but
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's good for all of us
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
so to be able to work to hold down a job
 
03:49:44.690 --> 03:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
to have something that motivates you and
 
03:49:46.969 --> 03:49:46.979 align:start position:0%
drives you forward so that that's just
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
one of the many areas I have several
 
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
different amendments that deal with
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
different aspects but I don't want to
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
monopolize this I just want to make sure
 
03:49:56.690 --> 03:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
that we have a chance to discuss what
 
03:49:58.610 --> 03:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
this bill would put permanently into law
 
03:50:00.769 --> 03:50:00.779 align:start position:0%
with no Sunset and make sure that we're
 
03:50:04.130 --> 03:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:50:07.080 --> 03:50:09.769 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
[Music]

03:50:09.769 --> 03:50:09.779 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
we held a very long hearing on Senate
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 263. well that was in 45 minutes
 
03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
and if I counted correctly which I may
 
03:50:20.210 --> 03:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
not have
 
03:50:24.530 --> 03:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh 33 people actually spoke to us
 
03:50:29.330 --> 03:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
and 34 people actually spoke to US 33 in
 
03:50:32.690 --> 03:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill as it stood and they
 
03:50:35.929 --> 03:50:35.939 align:start position:0%
and one person spoke against
 
03:50:38.170 --> 03:50:38.180 align:start position:0%
the people who spoke in favor
 
03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
represented a hugely broad Coalition of
 
03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
business medical care providers Medical
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
Care recipients people whose lives had
 
03:50:50.809 --> 03:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
been changed for the better
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
by the availability of Medicaid
 
03:50:58.610 --> 03:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
expansion and so to say that there are
 
03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
lots of problems with this bill
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
is to say that all of those people who
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
came and testified in favor of the bill
 
03:51:12.969 --> 03:51:12.979 align:start position:0%
are somehow wrong and
 
03:51:15.229 --> 03:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
what I heard
 
03:51:20.210 --> 03:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
at the hearing was a very broad approval
 
03:51:23.090 --> 03:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
of something which is in existence and
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
is working for many people the other
 
03:51:29.469 --> 03:51:29.479 align:start position:0%
thing I heard is that
 
03:51:32.450 --> 03:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly that this is a bill that
 
03:51:35.090 --> 03:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
allows people to get healthy enough to
 
03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
be able to work more and then to be able
 
03:51:38.580 --> 03:51:39.849 align:start position:0%
be able to work more and then to be able
to

03:51:39.849 --> 03:51:39.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
provide their own health care or get
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
Health Care on the exchanges it's not a
 
03:51:47.530 --> 03:51:47.540 align:start position:0%
forever thing
 
03:51:51.769 --> 03:51:51.779 align:start position:0%
it's it's the middle set of people who
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
tend to need help for a time either
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
because of a life crisis or because of a
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
medical crisis and it helps them get on
 
03:52:03.410 --> 03:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
their way and get back to being a
 
03:52:06.610 --> 03:52:06.620 align:start position:0%
productive member of society
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
if what you're defining productive by is
 
03:52:13.190 --> 03:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
holding a job earning earning money and
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
paying taxes there are other ways of
 
03:52:19.969 --> 03:52:19.979 align:start position:0%
being productive obviously so I think
 
03:52:22.910 --> 03:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
that for us to say that the collective
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
wisdom of all of the people who
 
03:52:28.190 --> 03:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
testified in front of us is wrong
 
03:52:28.200 --> 03:52:29.590 align:start position:0%
testified in front of us is wrong
somehow

03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
and that we need to start over again
 
03:52:33.920 --> 03:52:35.650 align:start position:0%
and that we need to start over again
is

03:52:35.650 --> 03:52:35.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
simply not the right way to go and I
 
03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
would I would prefer to have the
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee pass the bill and pass it as
 
03:52:47.809 --> 03:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
it is I think really the the discussion
 
03:52:51.650 --> 03:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
is whether it is going to be the
 
03:52:53.690 --> 03:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
two-year extension in the house budget
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
or whatever the Senate does with the
 
03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
Senate budget but I would love to have
 
03:53:02.050 --> 03:53:02.060 align:start position:0%
this committee and the house
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
firm that this is a program that has
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
changed people's lives and will change
 
03:53:12.290 --> 03:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
people's lives going forward and that we
 
03:53:13.790 --> 03:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
embrace it
 
03:53:15.830 --> 03:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative Hull would you be hand up
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
I did thank you chairman
 
03:53:20.990 --> 03:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a common goal for all
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
the members on the committee of taking
 
03:53:25.130 --> 03:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
care of those who who need help the most
 
03:53:25.140 --> 03:53:27.710 align:start position:0%
care of those who who need help the most
and

03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
we need to be careful
 
03:53:33.050 --> 03:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
when we use tax dollars
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
for people who
 
03:53:35.760 --> 03:53:36.530 align:start position:0%
for people who
um

03:53:36.530 --> 03:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:39.229 --> 03:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
are are not permanently disabled right
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
because we're comparing taking care of
 
03:53:42.370 --> 03:53:42.380 align:start position:0%
someone who's permanently disabled on
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicaid versus someone who
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
ran into a life event life event may be
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
something in terms of trauma to their
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
family something in terms of a job
 
03:53:55.849 --> 03:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
change and they're in this transition
 
03:53:58.190 --> 03:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
but if I understood the member from
 
03:54:00.110 --> 03:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
Walpole correctly right 33 people
 
03:54:02.929 --> 03:54:02.939 align:start position:0%
testified in favor but the last number I
 
03:54:04.490 --> 03:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
saw was almost a hundred thousand people
 
03:54:06.889 --> 03:54:06.899 align:start position:0%
on the program so as a percentage of
 
03:54:08.809 --> 03:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
those participating in the program that
 
03:54:12.290 --> 03:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
33 is a relatively small
 
03:54:15.530 --> 03:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I would like to to explore things
 
03:54:17.450 --> 03:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
that would help these people as they
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
transition out because unfortunately I
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we're seeing the trend we
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
all see this as a as a transitory
 
03:54:25.729 --> 03:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
program there's a lot of people who are
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
staying on this program for much longer
 
03:54:30.769 --> 03:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
periods of time and I think we need to
 
03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
craft a program that helps people as
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to just supports people in the
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
terms of giving them something and and
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
leaves them at that state jobs are a
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
beneficial thing that was one thing that
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
was discussed earlier
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's a training issue maybe we
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that they have
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
adequate training and getting them into
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
the unemployment security is part of the
 
03:54:55.729 --> 03:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
key element to getting them back on
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
their feet so there are definitely
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
things to explore
 
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
I will say representative oh I'm glad
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
that only 30 33 people came instead of
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
all right I might be a little off base
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
here but
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I know lots of people with college
 
03:55:20.689 --> 03:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
degrees who have jobs but their jobs do
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
not hit full-time and it's because
 
03:55:25.849 --> 03:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
companies can't afford to pay the
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
insurance so plenty of people who are
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
well trained educated and whatever are
 
03:55:33.889 --> 03:55:33.899 align:start position:0%
kept under the 35 33 hours a week
 
03:55:36.530 --> 03:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
whatever that would apply to full time
 
03:55:40.490 --> 03:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
who who don't have insurance so and and
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
also someone who gets on if we authorize
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
this bill this doesn't mean that we're
 
03:55:48.889 --> 03:55:48.899 align:start position:0%
as I feel an undertone here that we're
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
authorizing everyone who's on it now to
 
03:55:53.809 --> 03:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
be on it the rest of their lives all of
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
these programs are our income based and
 
03:55:59.090 --> 03:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
vetted either every one year or every
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
two years if Mr Lipman was here I would
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
ask him so
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm at the hairdresser last week and um
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
they she working business whatever
 
03:56:14.030 --> 03:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
husband and the trades they can't afford
 
03:56:16.490 --> 03:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
insurance for them and pay for all other
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
things they need they have insurance for
 
03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
their children and then the other
 
03:56:22.610 --> 03:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
hairdresser binked around the corner
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
because we were talking about pet
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
insurance so both of them have pet
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
insurances for their pets but they can't
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
afford it for themselves so I I think
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
that to bring up this argument every two
 
03:56:39.710 --> 03:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
years to bring you know when I first
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
came on the legislature five years ago
 
03:56:45.710 --> 03:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
we were discussing the work requirement
 
03:56:50.689 --> 03:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
for this which was uh cruel and and
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
ungainly for many people in New
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when they tried to anyway
 
03:57:01.309 --> 03:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
so I think we should pass this as is and
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
nobody wants people to be on
 
03:57:08.090 --> 03:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
as some of you are kind of hinting at
 
03:57:11.689 --> 03:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
like free government sponsored Health
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
Care forever most people as a
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist most people are happiest
 
03:57:18.530 --> 03:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
when they're working when they have a
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
purpose in life and when they can and
 
03:57:23.210 --> 03:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
their when they're self-sufficient and
 
03:57:27.469 --> 03:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
this kind of a program gives people a
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
leg a foot a knee an arm up to be able
 
03:57:33.170 --> 03:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
to get there and
 
03:57:33.180 --> 03:57:34.429 align:start position:0%
to get there and
um

03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think we should pass it thank you
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
03:57:40.910 --> 03:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:57:44.090 --> 03:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I would agree wholeheartedly with
 
03:57:46.010 --> 03:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
what a few people said about the
 
03:57:47.870 --> 03:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
importance of work
 
03:57:47.880 --> 03:57:48.830 align:start position:0%
importance of work
um

03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
and um certainly for myself work has
 
03:57:56.410 --> 03:57:56.420 align:start position:0%
been an incredibly important and um
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
fulfilling part of my life socially
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
um having a purpose earning money
 
03:58:07.130 --> 03:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
feeling in in all ways and I would
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
encourage it makes me really sad when I
 
03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
hear young people talking about work is
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
just something you gotta do
 
03:58:14.760 --> 03:58:15.769 align:start position:0%
just something you gotta do
um

03:58:15.769 --> 03:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:15.779 --> 03:58:17.050 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

03:58:17.050 --> 03:58:17.060 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
so I will say that I personally
 
03:58:24.889 --> 03:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
um put in bills to repeal the work
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
um requirement in the current
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
um authorization
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
um because I saw it as a problem that it
 
03:58:34.370 --> 03:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
was there but it wasn't it wasn't
 
03:58:36.610 --> 03:58:36.620 align:start position:0%
implemented it wasn't in effect but
 
03:58:39.290 --> 03:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
those bills
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
were defeated because
 
03:58:41.760 --> 03:58:42.590 align:start position:0%
were defeated because
um

03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
people who were interested in it in the
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
first place wanted to keep it in
 
03:58:47.640 --> 03:58:48.650 align:start position:0%
first place wanted to keep it in
um

03:58:48.650 --> 03:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
the reason it was never implemented was
 
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
because of court cases where
 
03:58:54.300 --> 03:58:55.550 align:start position:0%
because of court cases where
um

03:58:55.550 --> 03:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
first in Kentucky and here and then here
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and one other state
 
03:59:02.570 --> 03:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
which I can't remember where it was
 
03:59:05.090 --> 03:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
ruled by federal judges that Medicaid
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
was a health insurance program not a um
 
03:59:13.490 --> 03:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
work training program or a character
 
03:59:17.210 --> 03:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
building program so that the amount of
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
work that we were requiring
 
03:59:20.399 --> 03:59:22.210 align:start position:0%
work that we were requiring
um

03:59:22.210 --> 03:59:22.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
did not fit with
 
03:59:24.720 --> 03:59:25.870 align:start position:0%
did not fit with
um

03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
I guess what would what the courts
 
03:59:31.729 --> 03:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
considered constitutional
 
03:59:31.739 --> 03:59:36.349 align:start position:0%
considered constitutional
um

03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
I want to just throw into the
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversation here that um
 
03:59:46.189 --> 03:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
70 of the people on Medicaid work
 
03:59:50.210 --> 03:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
either part-time or full-time and I I do
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
believe it you know I think when we talk
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid in this committee I think
 
03:59:56.880 --> 04:00:00.729 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid in this committee I think
um

04:00:00.729 --> 04:00:00.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.610 --> 04:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
people some people
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
um think speak about it as a medical
 
04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
coverage medical care for people who
 
04:00:12.130 --> 04:00:12.140 align:start position:0%
can't afford Medical Care First
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
some people speak about it as something
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
that creates dependency first I'm
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who agrees that potentially it
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
can create dependency and that's a
 
04:00:22.800 --> 04:00:24.110 align:start position:0%
can create dependency and that's a
problem

04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but I for me that's way down the list
 
04:00:28.849 --> 04:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
of what it does
 
04:00:31.070 --> 04:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
um for me the fact that it provides
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
medical care that it keeps people
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
healthy that it gives them the
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go out and work it gives
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to um
 
04:00:42.170 --> 04:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
be full members of society that comes
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
way before the fact that it does create
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
dependency and I've been looking into
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
the fact about this issue of dependency
 
04:00:51.050 --> 04:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
because I think it's something that we
 
04:00:53.450 --> 04:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
struggle with as a committee and I want
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
to do something about
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
um the way this is referred to is is the
 
04:01:02.330 --> 04:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
the benefits Cliff you know what keeps
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
people from
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
going off state benefits or federal
 
04:01:10.929 --> 04:01:10.939 align:start position:0%
benefits um and the fact that frequently
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
what people are going to lose if they
 
04:01:17.929 --> 04:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
work more hours or work at higher pay is
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
so much greater than what they will gain
 
04:01:22.010 --> 04:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a problem and I didn't
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
know this but there's actually a
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
committee within DHHS that's um that is
 
04:01:32.689 --> 04:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
um has been created just to deal with
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
the benefits cliff and what what we can
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
change in
 
04:01:40.010 --> 04:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
not only with Medicaid but all all of
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
the different kinds of Medicaid
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
all of the different kinds of benefits
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
food stamps um TANF all those things
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
what we can do to make policy changes
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
that would encourage people to move on
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
with their lives either by getting
 
04:01:57.889 --> 04:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
education by getting higher paying jobs
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
by getting jobs if they don't have jobs
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
instead of being reluctant to do that
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
because they're going to lose out so I
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
think that is an important issue and I
 
04:02:09.290 --> 04:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
think it is something that's I don't
 
04:02:11.090 --> 04:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
know to what degree it's being addressed
 
04:02:13.250 --> 04:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
but it is it's it's a recognized issue
 
04:02:15.889 --> 04:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
that is being addressed which I would
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
think that maybe we as a committee in
 
04:02:21.530 --> 04:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
the future can can play a part in
 
04:02:21.540 --> 04:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
the future can can play a part in
um

04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:23.040 --> 04:02:23.870 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
but I think this bill Medicaid expansion
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
um is not going to address that it's not
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to fix all the problems with
 
04:02:37.130 --> 04:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
um with dependency with poverty
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
um you know when you think about it
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
poverty is one of the few
 
04:02:43.370 --> 04:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
issues that we've seemed to have made
 
04:02:46.010 --> 04:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
almost no progress with
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
um we've made all kinds of scientific
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
advances we've made advances where
 
04:02:55.610 --> 04:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
um you know people have all kinds of
 
04:02:59.809 --> 04:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
material things like TVs and cell phones
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
poor people and wealthy people but the
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
number of people who live in poverty who
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
don't have who have trouble feeding
 
04:03:09.170 --> 04:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
themselves and keeping themselves
 
04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
sheltered has not really changed at all
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that maybe we can have an
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
effect on that if we work on this
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
benefits Cliff but I think in terms of
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
I'm rambling on a little bit I can't I
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
can't I can't I can't say I can't speak
 
04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
as well as Senator Bradley who I think
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
spoke so eloquently about all the
 
04:03:37.490 --> 04:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
reasons why this has been a tremendous
 
04:03:41.110 --> 04:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
success why even if it's
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
reauthorized permanently there are guard
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
rails in the bill to protect us from all
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
of a sudden having to pay a greater
 
04:03:51.650 --> 04:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
share of the um
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
expense for it
 
04:03:54.120 --> 04:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
expense for it
um

04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:57.170 --> 04:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
I think it's just been I just think it's
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
been a a success it hasn't solved all of
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
society's problems it hasn't so it
 
04:04:02.580 --> 04:04:03.950 align:start position:0%
society's problems it hasn't so it
hasn't

04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
04:04:03.960 --> 04:04:05.870 align:start position:0%
hasn't
um

04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
it hasn't changed our you know some of
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
the basic dilemmas with health care but
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's been a tremendous success
 
04:04:15.050 --> 04:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
in keeping people insured
 
04:04:18.490 --> 04:04:18.500 align:start position:0%
keeping providers from having to
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
continually give out reimbursed care and
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have greater public
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
health and so I will definitely vote to
 
04:04:28.859 --> 04:04:30.950 align:start position:0%
health and so I will definitely vote to
um

04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.010 --> 04:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
to vote for reauthorizing it permanently
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
04:04:39.290 --> 04:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I wanted to address one
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
small thing that I said that I think has
 
04:04:43.370 --> 04:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
been misinterpreted I'm in speaking
 
04:04:46.010 --> 04:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
about permanent or continuing Medicaid
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
expansion I wasn't talking about that
 
04:04:49.729 --> 04:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
for the individuals but I was talking
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
about this relic of um of law that we
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
put into place in 2019 that is already
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
outdated continuing to be that vehicle
 
04:05:00.290 --> 04:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
as people hopefully use Medicaid
 
04:05:02.090 --> 04:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
expansion as a waypoint not a
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
destination as they get to other points
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
in their life while we support people
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I was perfectly
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
happy putting Medicaid expansion into
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
the budget with the two-year Sunset
 
04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
um was because there are a lot of people
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
that I speak to that have Medicaid and
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
they have serious problems with the
 
04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
program the way that they're accessing
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
it other ones as well there's there are
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of challenges even for people who
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
are using Medicaid right now there's
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
problems for providers who are providing
 
04:05:37.010 --> 04:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
services that are reimbursed by Medicaid
 
04:05:40.849 --> 04:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
and the idea of just having a relic stay
 
04:05:43.370 --> 04:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
in statute forever now representative
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I really applaud your effort to
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
try and remove that work requirement
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
because the courts had voted against it
 
04:05:52.010 --> 04:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
but this piecemeal approach to
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
addressing it doesn't really seem to
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
work because it's all together in one
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
basket and it's a matter of them looking
 
04:05:59.929 --> 04:05:59.939 align:start position:0%
at which apples and which oranges are in
 
04:06:02.450 --> 04:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
this basket as as we move forward and
 
04:06:04.250 --> 04:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons I see value to
 
04:06:06.410 --> 04:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
having a sunset I don't want to
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
monopolize a conversation I just wanted
 
04:06:09.889 --> 04:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody under stands
 
04:06:11.570 --> 04:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
that I do know Medicaid expansion is
 
04:06:13.250 --> 04:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a waypoint and not a
 
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
destination representative McLean
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I think everybody on this committee
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
uh understands that you know that we
 
04:06:24.290 --> 04:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
um renew the Medicaid uh expansion
 
04:06:29.150 --> 04:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
because those things that used to exist
 
04:06:33.290 --> 04:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
aren't there anymore and so to not renew
 
04:06:34.849 --> 04:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid expansion at this point
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
would leave a lot of people out in the
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
cold I think the concern is just with
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Perpetual renewal
 
04:06:45.710 --> 04:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the things you know if we look
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
at the Affordable Care Act the
 
04:06:50.689 --> 04:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act came into play over
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
a decade ago and there were many
 
04:06:55.010 --> 04:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
different pieces in the Affordable Care
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
Act that were supposed to work and we're
 
04:06:59.689 --> 04:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
supposed to have price transparency the
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
exchanges health care costs are going to
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
come down we really didn't see a lot of
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
that the one thing at least on the
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
surface that did appear to work was the
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion and I think in many
 
04:07:16.610 --> 04:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
ways because of that
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion became the victim of
 
04:07:23.090 --> 04:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
its own success and we saw that a lot in
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
this committee this is my first time on
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
this committee but we saw Bill after
 
04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
Bill after Bill uh let's add this group
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid let's add this group to
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you know because the perception
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
is that this this is the component of it
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
that's actually delivering the goods but
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know I wasn't here for the public
 
04:07:42.720 --> 04:07:43.849 align:start position:0%
you know I wasn't here for the public
hearing

04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:07:45.290 --> 04:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I was off
 
04:07:47.929 --> 04:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
um doing shingo training and when I was
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
off doing training one of the folks on
 
04:07:53.450 --> 04:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
my shingo dream was a pediatrician from
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh Dr Elliot Melendez so
 
04:07:58.610 --> 04:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
he's uh he's a chief of pediatric
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
Critical Care in Connecticut Children's
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hospital so I said how you how you
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
making out in in Connecticut how are
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
things going and he said boys he says
 
04:08:12.769 --> 04:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is killing us
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
he said now we are different than you in
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I mean I'm in Hartford you
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
know Connecticut Children's in Hartford
 
04:08:23.150 --> 04:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
so we're 60 Urban but you can imagine
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
with the reimbursement rates that we get
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
on on Medical Care on Medicaid
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
um we're just hanging on financially by
 
04:08:35.450 --> 04:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
our fingernails and so I think in many
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
ways he may be a Harbinger for what we
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
may see here down the road we are not
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut we are not an urban
 
04:08:45.889 --> 04:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
environment like like they are
 
04:08:48.849 --> 04:08:48.859 align:start position:0%
but we do have a quarter million people
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
in this state on Medicaid and that
 
04:08:55.370 --> 04:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
number is growing that's almost one in
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
five people so I really do have concerns
 
04:09:01.370 --> 04:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
um about the long-term Financial
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
viability and a long-term effect on our
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals um if we just let this thing
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
go without a revisit and the other thing
 
04:09:12.610 --> 04:09:12.620 align:start position:0%
though putting the financials aside
 
04:09:14.929 --> 04:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro to kind of talk
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
about what you're talking about which is
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
the benefits cliff I think the benefits
 
04:09:23.929 --> 04:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
Cliff is real when I first came to New
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over 20 years ago I came to
 
04:09:29.090 --> 04:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I lived in Clock Tower Place
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
you may know what clock tower places now
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful place it's it's it's
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
high-end it's a converted Mill Loft
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
Apartments great but all of my neighbors
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
were on social assistance you know some
 
04:09:44.809 --> 04:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
Section 8 housing they're on Medicaid
 
04:09:47.150 --> 04:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
Etc and so on and these were good people
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
these were not lazy people staying at
 
04:09:50.279 --> 04:09:51.050 align:start position:0%
these were not lazy people staying at
home

04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
um playing video games these were good
 
04:09:56.450 --> 04:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
people and these were my friends and you
 
04:09:59.150 --> 04:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
know one of them a lady right next door
 
04:10:03.290 --> 04:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
Mirna she had a job offer at a doctor's
 
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
office but she says Mark you know I
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do she says if I take
 
04:10:11.210 --> 04:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
this job then I'm going to lose a lot of
 
04:10:14.150 --> 04:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
my housing support and I'm going to lose
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
the coverage for my kids and she said
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
you know and instead of having you as my
 
04:10:21.290 --> 04:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
neighbor I'm going to be living down in
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the trees you know Ash Street Pine
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
Street at 7 and so on and so she she
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
made the decision ultimately not to go
 
04:10:31.849 --> 04:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
forward and she wanted that job so bad
 
04:10:34.010 --> 04:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
you know and so she's back she's working
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the table who am I to judge her is
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
she a bad person I don't think she's a
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
bad person she was a great neighbor she
 
04:10:43.610 --> 04:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
was a wonderful lady and she was an
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
excellent mom to those kids so I don't
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
judge her but I do judge the system
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
that kept her from realizing her full
 
04:10:59.450 --> 04:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
potential and so what we have in this
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
bill to address that is a commission and
 
04:11:06.290 --> 04:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
this commission is going to meet and do
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
a report out once a year and you
 
04:11:09.410 --> 04:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well something I was
 
04:11:12.130 --> 04:11:12.140 align:start position:0%
unaware of within DHHS
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
but I really think that the commission
 
04:11:19.010 --> 04:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
is woefully inadequate it you need to
 
04:11:21.410 --> 04:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
have something that is looking at this
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
very actively and that just hasn't been
 
04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
done yet so I would be much more
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
interested to you know see what that is
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to do see what DHHS is coming
 
04:11:35.330 --> 04:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
forward in some of these areas
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that and then you know
 
04:11:40.130 --> 04:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
leveraging that at some point in the
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
future to a permanent authorization but
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
the real thing for me is what's going to
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
push that I think is the stick I mean
 
04:11:52.130 --> 04:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
we're all good people here in this room
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
and once this is made permanent we've
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
got opioid crisis we've got a housing
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
crisis we've got a homeless crisis we've
 
04:12:02.769 --> 04:12:02.779 align:start position:0%
got a mental health crisis I see us
 
04:12:06.050 --> 04:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
pivoting okay Medicaid expansion that's
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
dealt with for now and the stick isn't
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
there anymore and so we're focused off
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
on these other issues not because we
 
04:12:15.050 --> 04:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
don't care about just a lot going on I
 
04:12:17.450 --> 04:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
think the stick needs to be maintained
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that it's going to force to revisit
 
04:12:21.650 --> 04:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think I don't know what
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
the nature of that final extension is
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
going to look like those error as
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Leon said is it two years
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
four years whatever but I don't think we
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
should be going for a permanent
 
04:12:34.969 --> 04:12:34.979 align:start position:0%
extension at this time uh thank you Mr
 
04:12:39.650 --> 04:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion whether it's for two
 
04:12:53.889 --> 04:12:53.899 align:start position:0%
years or six years
 
04:12:56.689 --> 04:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
which would allow for more successful
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
procurement of Managed Care contracts or
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
permanent is not going to solve
 
04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that you talked
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
about both in Medicaid in terms of
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates although the our new
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
budget the house budget does have some
 
04:13:17.050 --> 04:13:17.060 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive Medicaid rate increases
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
or the problem with the benefit Clips or
 
04:13:23.689 --> 04:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
just how we address poverty and
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
motivation in general in our society I
 
04:13:26.040 --> 04:13:27.170 align:start position:0%
motivation in general in our society I
don't

04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:13:30.650 --> 04:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't mean by any means to say
 
04:13:30.660 --> 04:13:31.630 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't mean by any means to say
that

04:13:31.630 --> 04:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:33.889 --> 04:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to solve those
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
problems we have a lot of deep societal
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
problems that we have to continue to
 
04:13:43.150 --> 04:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of providers
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
when I had a contract with the different
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid was among the lowest payers for
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
providing Psychotherapy and it was a
 
04:14:04.370 --> 04:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
problem it was quite low and I think
 
04:14:06.650 --> 04:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that results in
 
04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
problems with Workforce shortage and I'm
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
sure it's a problem with doctors of all
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
kinds and hospitals
 
04:14:17.530 --> 04:14:17.540 align:start position:0%
taking medicaid insurance
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
but consider what the alternative is
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
which is that they're not getting
 
04:14:25.010 --> 04:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at all for that care and that
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
they are providing that care
 
04:14:27.439 --> 04:14:29.410 align:start position:0%
they are providing that care
as

04:14:29.410 --> 04:14:29.420 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:14:33.969 --> 04:14:33.979 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed care so I think that is why
 
04:14:36.889 --> 04:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
we've seen the provider communities come
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
come in and say this is a very important
 
04:14:46.250 --> 04:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.260 --> 04:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:14:47.110 --> 04:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and then over here
 
04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
I think I could talk all day on this one
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.849 --> 04:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
um a couple years ago
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
um the American Bar Association the
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
American Medical Association sat down
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
and they came up with you know looking
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
at ethical issues for doctors and
 
04:15:07.849 --> 04:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
lawyers it came to this conclusion that
 
04:15:09.769 --> 04:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
we had a responsibility to care for the
 
04:15:11.809 --> 04:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
people in need so they made a joint
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation that people that were
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
either in the bar where the AMA were
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
supposed to give about 10 percent of
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
their care to the poor that was great
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
um and then comes Medicaid and as you
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
know Medicaid was actually founded
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
because the healthcare Market was not
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
caring for the poor and the disabled and
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
it was a strategy because they were
 
04:15:32.150 --> 04:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
being cherry-picked out of insurers to
 
04:15:34.130 --> 04:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
cover them so
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
um that's why Medicaid was formed
 
04:15:38.210 --> 04:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
initially and I remember talking to my
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
dad when he was when I was young he was
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
an anesthesiologist and he basically
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion that it costs we
 
04:15:46.849 --> 04:15:46.859 align:start position:0%
always forget that the only number in
 
04:15:48.290 --> 04:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
business that matters is net revenue
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's not gross revenue it's it's net
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
revenue it's your your net gross revenue
 
04:15:55.849 --> 04:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
minus costs but he said that he goes you
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
know what he goes we don't even Bill
 
04:15:59.330 --> 04:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and we just do it for free and
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
it goes why is that because he said
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
because it costs us more to build
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid than it does then we get back
 
04:16:06.530 --> 04:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
so he says we might as well just do it
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
for free on satisfy Our obligation
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think one of the biggest sins in
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
health care in this country was the
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
death of Private Practice I think that a
 
04:16:16.969 --> 04:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues that we're talking
 
04:16:19.729 --> 04:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
about now like burnout and all these
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
other things would be are because
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
doctors have absolutely no control of
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
their environments anymore and and I
 
04:16:28.130 --> 04:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
talked to hospitalists and people at
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they think Medicaid
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
expansion is wonderful it's great it's
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful I said in private practice
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's horrible I mean
 
04:16:38.809 --> 04:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
we've gone from A system that we used to
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
be able to do what we thought was best
 
04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
for our patients and granted that's
 
04:16:44.809 --> 04:16:44.819 align:start position:0%
unlimited control in a blank check's not
 
04:16:46.610 --> 04:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
a good thing but at the same time you've
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
gone to the exact opposite extreme and
 
04:16:50.150 --> 04:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
what I can deal with with commercial
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
insurers is that I've got people that I
 
04:16:54.170 --> 04:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
can deal with that I can interact who
 
04:16:55.849 --> 04:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
question what I'm doing that I can talk
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
to and then do what I think I need to do
 
04:17:00.889 --> 04:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid expansion that is totally
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
not true the people that make the
 
04:17:05.150 --> 04:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
decisions for me are not experts in my
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
field they will make unreasonable
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
demands of my time for very little money
 
04:17:13.370 --> 04:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
in return they will
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
um after they've denied my my request to
 
04:17:18.769 --> 04:17:18.779 align:start position:0%
do a procedure they use evidence base
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly questionable at best
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
and there doesn't seem to be enough
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
transparency about that I talked to our
 
04:17:27.050 --> 04:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
practice manager she said Medicaid
 
04:17:30.050 --> 04:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
expansion is killing us and we also have
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
to realize that we're talking about two
 
04:17:33.889 --> 04:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
separate things we're not we're talking
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
about you know Medicaid for a new group
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
of patients that were people that were
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
insurable before that are not now and
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
then we're talking about the poor and
 
04:17:43.010 --> 04:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
disabled they're two totally different
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
groups of people
 
04:17:48.530 --> 04:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
um but as far as I'm concerned if I I
 
04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a private practitioner I'm one of
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
the last private practitioners left in
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
this in this state
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
and and to me um I would never work for
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else and
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and this is making my job harder and
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
harder and harder to do and the other
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
thing is the cost of me employing people
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with their denials their demands
 
04:18:10.250 --> 04:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
when they're not paying me enough in
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
return to make it worthwhile that's a
 
04:18:16.610 --> 04:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
real problem and I think that as we go
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
forward with our health care decisions
 
04:18:20.150 --> 04:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
especially for people with complex
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities I look at Medicaid
 
04:18:24.410 --> 04:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
expansion as a necessary evil and a
 
04:18:26.570 --> 04:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid on a broken system the reason
 
04:18:28.490 --> 04:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
why I think that there should be limits
 
04:18:30.889 --> 04:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
10 20 years or whatever
 
04:18:35.090 --> 04:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
is that I if you don't give people a
 
04:18:37.370 --> 04:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
limit they will go on forever and I just
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't think this this program can
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
continue to grow unbridled and it needs
 
04:18:44.090 --> 04:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
to have some oversight and some limit
 
04:18:46.250 --> 04:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's enough for me representative
 
04:18:46.260 --> 04:18:48.229 align:start position:0%
that's enough for me representative
Murphy

04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
04:18:50.689 --> 04:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
I think anybody that's practicing
 
04:18:54.530 --> 04:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
medicine like Dr Nagel representative
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
Nagel has done could speak forever on
 
04:18:58.250 --> 04:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
this and we would we should never do
 
04:18:58.260 --> 04:18:59.389 align:start position:0%
this and we would we should never do
that

04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:01.729 --> 04:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
um I haven't said that
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I was never in private practice I've
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
always been involved in a tertiary Care
 
04:19:07.969 --> 04:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
Medical Center where we took all cameras
 
04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
we were salaried we took all cameras and
 
04:19:12.410 --> 04:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
that included probably two-thirds of our
 
04:19:13.689 --> 04:19:13.699 align:start position:0%
book of business was Federal
 
04:19:16.729 --> 04:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so he had Medicare which
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
people would say is pretty good that was
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
after sequestration that was cost minus
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
one percent and Medicaid which is about
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
50 cents in the dollar so yes the
 
04:19:26.929 --> 04:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is not good but as others
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
have said some reimbursements better
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
than none because when you have a raise
 
04:19:32.450 --> 04:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
or thin margin of one percent in a
 
04:19:35.330 --> 04:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
hospital or a negative margin any funds
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
coming in to support the organization in
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
other patients that need that
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
organization is beneficial but I wanted
 
04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
to speak to something else and
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the the permanency
 
04:19:47.769 --> 04:19:47.779 align:start position:0%
issue of this because
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
you're really speaking to the fact that
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
this if this is a broken system I would
 
04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
always say we have really good health
 
04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
care but you have a team which I would
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
rank as a plus in many circumstances
 
04:19:59.689 --> 04:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
there are many great clinicians that
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
want to take good care of you
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
administratively across the country in
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
the state in the region I'd give us
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
probably a good d-minus as far as
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
operational you know uh running of the
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
show I get that and I've lived through
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
it on the other hand this is a really a
 
04:20:16.130 --> 04:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
federal you've got to remember what
 
04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is it's a federal program I
 
04:20:20.090 --> 04:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
know it's shared by the state Medicare
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
is 100 Federal this is a shared program
 
04:20:24.769 --> 04:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's Federal so when I look at the
 
04:20:26.330 --> 04:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
permanency of this I'm thinking it's
 
04:20:27.769 --> 04:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
permanent until the federal government
 
04:20:29.570 --> 04:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
can come up with a better
 
04:20:32.330 --> 04:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know Health Care Program for the
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
country and or the citizens in the
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
country so uh to me you know it's it's a
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
federal program in many ways and until
 
04:20:43.370 --> 04:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
it becomes
 
04:20:47.090 --> 04:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
um uh uh changed in some way by the
 
04:20:49.010 --> 04:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
federal government I would vote for
 
04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
permanency only because once the federal
 
04:20:52.849 --> 04:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
government changes it gets rid of it
 
04:20:55.250 --> 04:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
modifies it we can Will basically be out
 
04:20:56.090 --> 04:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:20:57.769 --> 04:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
but I would also speak to one other
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
thing that you know you see regularly
 
04:21:02.689 --> 04:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
with these patients is the psychological
 
04:21:04.849 --> 04:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh benefit you know we can speak about
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
how it's good for Hospital reimbursement
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
to have something versus nothing we can
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
speak about the job force and if you
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a job you can have health care you
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
can get a job and be employed I
 
04:21:14.929 --> 04:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
understand all that there's a lot of
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
arguments in favor of it but I would
 
04:21:18.650 --> 04:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
argue about also the psychological
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
impact of having insurance and so you
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
would oftentimes see patients come in
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
with delayed care for whatever it could
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
be a large mass it could be you know
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
their hypertension you know we've seen
 
04:21:32.929 --> 04:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
because of covet you know you don't have
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
access and have not had access
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
um appropriately for a lot of patients
 
04:21:38.090 --> 04:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
because they were afraid to go in there
 
04:21:38.100 --> 04:21:38.929 align:start position:0%
because they were afraid to go in there
but

04:21:38.929 --> 04:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
when a patient gets Medicaid they don't
 
04:21:44.809 --> 04:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
understand that you're getting paid 50
 
04:21:47.330 --> 04:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
cents on the dollar as a provider they
 
04:21:49.010 --> 04:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
just don't get that they just know that
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
they are proud to have health care
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
insurance and they come through that
 
04:21:54.050 --> 04:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
door thinking that they're going to be
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
treated as everybody else and they are
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so psychologically for many of these
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
patients it's a real advantage to have
 
04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
health insurance because they really
 
04:22:05.570 --> 04:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
feel like I am now contributing I have
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
health care insurance I'm paying you for
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
the service you give me and you know and
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
they're very happy and proud of that but
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
the other part of it the derivative
 
04:22:16.010 --> 04:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
benefit of that is that we are seeing
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
patients that have insurance when they
 
04:22:20.689 --> 04:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
need to be seen so if you don't have
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
health insurance you're not going to get
 
04:22:24.110 --> 04:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
your routine colonoscopy you're not
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
going to get your routine mammogram
 
04:22:26.929 --> 04:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get your routine
 
04:22:28.729 --> 04:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
blood studies for whatever else you're
 
04:22:30.410 --> 04:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
looking to to take care of your
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
hypertension meds so these patients
 
04:22:34.969 --> 04:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
psychologically feel a tremendous
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
benefit having Medicaid and as a result
 
04:22:38.929 --> 04:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
of that they are coming in to see you
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're contributing and
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
they are to some degree but they are
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
also getting good care in a timely
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
manner which when you think about it
 
04:22:48.290 --> 04:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
down the road if you take care of a
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
problem now it costs you ten dollars you
 
04:22:52.370 --> 04:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
take care of a problem that's missed
 
04:22:53.689 --> 04:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
down the road it's going to cost
 
04:22:56.150 --> 04:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars so ultimately we're
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
going to lose out when we don't support
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
having health care for all is it a
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
broken system I don't disagree with you
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
on that should it be permanent not
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
permanent in the sense that you're
 
04:23:06.050 --> 04:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
talking about but permanent in the sense
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
that as long as the feds keep this
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
program going we we should be part of it
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
as well and when they change it we can
 
04:23:13.610 --> 04:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
then change it at that point in time so
 
04:23:15.769 --> 04:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
I would clearly vote in favor of this
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons that go well beyond
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
what I just said and I took too much
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
time anyway so thank you representative
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
Cushman did you have your hand up
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
just thank you Mr chairman
 
04:23:27.710 --> 04:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I also could speak all day about this
 
04:23:29.570 --> 04:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm really trying to do that to limit
 
04:23:29.580 --> 04:23:31.070 align:start position:0%
so I'm really trying to do that to limit
myself

04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:23:31.080 --> 04:23:32.450 align:start position:0%
myself
um

04:23:32.450 --> 04:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
I I really have to agree with a lot of
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
what representative Nagel said
 
04:23:40.490 --> 04:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I see
 
04:23:43.729 --> 04:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of um we've had the discussion in
 
04:23:45.050 --> 04:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
here about bringing up the Health Care
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire and I see that
 
04:23:50.290 --> 04:23:50.300 align:start position:0%
dependence on a Medicaid
 
04:23:50.300 --> 04:23:52.150 align:start position:0%
dependence on a Medicaid
largely

04:23:52.150 --> 04:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
largely
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid based system a part of the
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
system being a huge piece of the pie
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
that makes up the payer mix being
 
04:24:00.479 --> 04:24:02.210 align:start position:0%
that makes up the payer mix being
Medicaid

04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:24:04.370 --> 04:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
um as on the one hand the reason that
 
04:24:06.110 --> 04:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
the hospitals say that we can't free up
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid the system and then you
 
04:24:08.939 --> 04:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid the system and then you
know

04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:24:12.050 --> 04:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
04:24:12.060 --> 04:24:13.070 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
um

04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:16.969 --> 04:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
it's sorry I lost my train of thought
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
the issue is
 
04:24:19.380 --> 04:24:20.809 align:start position:0%
the issue is
um

04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's putting pressure on the system
 
04:24:26.809 --> 04:24:26.819 align:start position:0%
but they say that we need it
 
04:24:26.819 --> 04:24:28.370 align:start position:0%
but they say that we need it
and

04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's limiting what's available
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
so to your point we can't have
 
04:24:37.849 --> 04:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
non-profit hospitals here because you
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
have to accept all payments which means
 
04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we can't have you know the
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
Cancer Centers of America come here
 
04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
um there's uh it's putting a
 
04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
a block on Innovation
 
04:24:52.380 --> 04:24:53.150 align:start position:0%
a block on Innovation
um

04:24:53.150 --> 04:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
you see that the care here is great sure
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
um there there are excellent hospitals
 
04:25:02.150 --> 04:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
in this state and excellent and smart
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
and talented Physicians
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
um but at the end of it all not everyone
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
wants that kind of care that Medicaid
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
reimburses and so when you're making it
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
um they will you know you're expecting
 
04:25:22.610 --> 04:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
that a big chunk of your patients will
 
04:25:24.050 --> 04:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
only be able to receive a certain kind
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
of care you're not incentivized to
 
04:25:27.530 --> 04:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
Branch out
 
04:25:29.450 --> 04:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
the other issue is the work thing I
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
think we're incentivizing people to not
 
04:25:35.090 --> 04:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
work in more than one way not only
 
04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
because there's no work requirement on
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
this but we're actually with this
 
04:25:42.290 --> 04:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
program subsidizing businesses where
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
they would otherwise provide for their
 
04:25:46.969 --> 04:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
employees and I think that's why a lot
 
04:25:48.530 --> 04:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
of businesses support this you know it's
 
04:25:50.929 --> 04:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
a subsidy that people like free things
 
04:25:53.330 --> 04:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
they like not having to have that
 
04:25:53.340 --> 04:25:55.189 align:start position:0%
they like not having to have that
responsibility

04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason that businesses
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
can't afford the insurance for people
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
well if there are there are regulations
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
in the way that make Insurance costly
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's get rid of them you know we need
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be making this more we need to be
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
opening up the system more and getting
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
to the root cause why is Health why is
 
04:26:14.450 --> 04:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
Health Care first of all not affordable
 
04:26:17.210 --> 04:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
and instead of relying on insurance to
 
04:26:18.649 --> 04:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
make it affordable and give that peace
 
04:26:20.210 --> 04:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
of mind just because you have a card in
 
04:26:21.769 --> 04:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
your wallet
 
04:26:23.210 --> 04:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
um people should feel good that they can
 
04:26:25.849 --> 04:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
get health care and it can be affordable
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
with or without insurance
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
so I just see that there's huge systemic
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
issues that this doesn't resolve and it
 
04:26:36.050 --> 04:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
just kicks the can down the road and
 
04:26:38.330 --> 04:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
making it permanent is a huge mistake
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
because it's if anything you know we
 
04:26:45.050 --> 04:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
have a very big Workforce shortage and
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
if we're just you know it used to be
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
that you'd get a good job to get
 
04:26:52.490 --> 04:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
insurance you know you'd be like I have
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
to I have to have a job because I need
 
04:26:56.210 --> 04:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
to I need to have insurance to cover my
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
family and now it's different so I just
 
04:27:01.010 --> 04:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
see a a big mix of things playing into
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
this and
 
04:27:02.640 --> 04:27:05.330 align:start position:0%
this and
um

04:27:05.330 --> 04:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's not sustainable
 
04:27:10.130 --> 04:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
on the federal level with the debt and
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
you know the budget office saying that
 
04:27:16.130 --> 04:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
well we need to decrease the roles and
 
04:27:18.889 --> 04:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
we need to increase the share to the
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
state and that's good that that's in
 
04:27:23.149 --> 04:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
there that you know we would sever this
 
04:27:25.070 --> 04:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
program but would we really I mean that
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
would be devastating to a lot of people
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
to just stop it immediately you know
 
04:27:32.450 --> 04:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
something would have to be done for all
 
04:27:34.490 --> 04:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
those people you can't
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be like instant
 
04:27:37.260 --> 04:27:38.990 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be like instant
um

04:27:38.990 --> 04:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's just a huge overarching
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
problem with this and there are specific
 
04:27:46.490 --> 04:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
things in here that I
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I have a bunch of amendments to kind
 
04:27:49.080 --> 04:27:50.050 align:start position:0%
um I have a bunch of amendments to kind
of

04:27:50.050 --> 04:27:50.060 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
trim some of the the issues that I find
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
in it
 
04:27:54.720 --> 04:27:55.429 align:start position:0%
in it
um

04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:57.649 --> 04:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
you know are people actually utilizing
 
04:28:00.170 --> 04:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
it are they on it and not actually going
 
04:28:02.689 --> 04:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
to the doctor because if they are we're
 
04:28:05.330 --> 04:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
paying the mcos however much money per
 
04:28:08.450 --> 04:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
day to administer you know a certain
 
04:28:10.729 --> 04:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
number of people who are on it
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
but then they're not even using it I
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't know we shouldn't be paying
 
04:28:17.929 --> 04:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
Administration on accounts that aren't
 
04:28:20.570 --> 04:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
active you know what I mean
 
04:28:20.580 --> 04:28:22.610 align:start position:0%
active you know what I mean
um

04:28:22.610 --> 04:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.170 --> 04:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for now probably have
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
more comments later
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.750 --> 04:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'm trying
 
04:28:40.250 --> 04:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
to think of things that haven't come up
 
04:28:41.809 --> 04:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
first and the first thing that hasn't
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
come up is if we leave things as they
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
are in the budget in the house budget
 
04:28:51.649 --> 04:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh a two-year extension is not enough
 
04:28:55.250 --> 04:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
for competitive bidding on contracts
 
04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
so that was one of the issues that came
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
up with respect to the shorter time
 
04:29:01.439 --> 04:29:03.410 align:start position:0%
up with respect to the shorter time
periods

04:29:03.410 --> 04:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
periods
 
04:29:06.110 --> 04:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
at a minimum we need to have a longer
 
04:29:09.840 --> 04:29:13.550 align:start position:0%
at a minimum we need to have a longer
scope

04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.490 --> 04:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
then we get to the question of you know
 
04:29:19.070 --> 04:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
nothing sharpens the mind like having a
 
04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
hard deadline and having to do something
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm so glad we closed the salinity
 
04:29:28.969 --> 04:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
Center 17 years ago or whenever it was
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we had the first heart deadline
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
because we've had plenty of hard
 
04:29:34.729 --> 04:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
deadlines and the hard deadlines have
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
been in statute and every single time
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
we've run against the hard deadline and
 
04:29:40.929 --> 04:29:40.939 align:start position:0%
the problem hasn't been solved so we've
 
04:29:45.050 --> 04:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
extended on an emergency basis
 
04:29:48.290 --> 04:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and I realize that that's comparing
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges but the stick doesn't
 
04:29:55.250 --> 04:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
always work is my point here
 
04:29:55.260 --> 04:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
always work is my point here
um

04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:59.689 --> 04:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
to compare
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
to blame the existence of Medicaid for
 
04:30:06.370 --> 04:30:06.380 align:start position:0%
the lack of Cancer Centers of America
 
04:30:09.769 --> 04:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
for-profit hospitals in this state is
 
04:30:11.689 --> 04:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
just a disconnect
 
04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
plenty of states have Medicare Medicaid
 
04:30:16.370 --> 04:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid expansion and if I said
 
04:30:18.170 --> 04:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
Medicare before I'm sorry about that
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
because I
 
04:30:22.729 --> 04:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's a big bug of mine and I'm my
 
04:30:25.729 --> 04:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
apologies but if if
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
if we blame the existence of Medicaid
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
for the absence of these hospitals there
 
04:30:33.410 --> 04:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
are states where uh Medicaid expansion
 
04:30:35.450 --> 04:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
is in place in several Cancer Centers of
 
04:30:35.460 --> 04:30:37.070 align:start position:0%
is in place in several Cancer Centers of
America

04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
America
 
04:30:39.410 --> 04:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
um there are two separate things and the
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
reason we don't have for-profit
 
04:30:42.649 --> 04:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
hospitals is because we've voted it down
 
04:30:45.170 --> 04:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
when it's come up
 
04:30:45.180 --> 04:30:45.769 align:start position:0%
when it's come up
um

04:30:45.769 --> 04:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
I think that one of the very the two
 
04:30:52.130 --> 04:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
really oh one more point I wanted to
 
04:30:54.349 --> 04:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
make was the
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
um Commission on Aging which I actually
 
04:30:56.100 --> 04:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
um Commission on Aging which I actually
set

04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
set
 
04:31:01.969 --> 04:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
um noting that in particular for people
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
of about 55 years and older who are not
 
04:31:08.929 --> 04:31:08.939 align:start position:0%
yet Medicare eligible
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
um if they lose a job there's a huge gap
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
for them uh in terms of how are they
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to get coverage at a time when
 
04:31:20.450 --> 04:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
they are more likely to need coverage as
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to the 20-somethings who are
 
04:31:26.330 --> 04:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
less likely to need or use coverage
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
um I I did want to just refute the point
 
04:31:32.090 --> 04:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
about you know not all 100 000 people
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
who were on Medicaid expansion came to
 
04:31:38.090 --> 04:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
talk to us but the people who did come
 
04:31:40.849 --> 04:31:40.859 align:start position:0%
to talk to us were a broad spectrum of
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
people like the business and industry
 
04:31:46.610 --> 04:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
Association and and just saying that
 
04:31:46.620 --> 04:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
Association and and just saying that
business

04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
ought to offer
 
04:31:51.779 --> 04:31:52.550 align:start position:0%
ought to offer
um

04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
health care for everybody
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
I love that as a notion but the fact is
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
that five years ago we didn't have
 
04:32:02.809 --> 04:32:02.819 align:start position:0%
expanded Medicaid and business was not
 
04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
covering these people and these
 
04:32:07.250 --> 04:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
particular group were not getting
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and in particular and this
 
04:32:12.889 --> 04:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
is the absolute bottom line for me that
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the preventive care
 
04:32:17.450 --> 04:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
that they need to keep them out of the
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
more expensive
 
04:32:23.929 --> 04:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care that is yet another
 
04:32:26.090 --> 04:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the preventive care aspect is really the
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
one that does it for me
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bull did you
 
04:32:36.530 --> 04:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
ever end up earlier I did right and I
 
04:32:38.689 --> 04:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
come at this having sat for the most
 
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
part for the last four months on
 
04:32:44.210 --> 04:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
division three in finance discussing why
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
um expanded medicaid ended up you know
 
04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
your microphone went off
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I I commented this
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
having sat on division three in finance
 
04:32:56.570 --> 04:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
the division that covers um HHS or DHHS
 
04:32:59.090 --> 04:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time discussing
 
04:33:01.250 --> 04:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
um adding expanded medicaid into the
 
04:33:02.809 --> 04:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
budget the discussion of a two-year
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
versus a four-year versus an unlimited
 
04:33:05.039 --> 04:33:06.410 align:start position:0%
versus a four-year versus an unlimited
sunset

04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
04:33:08.209 --> 04:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
to the point about you can't get
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
contracts renewed you're right they're
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
in a two-year extension right there is
 
04:33:17.150 --> 04:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
no easy way to put that out for bid but
 
04:33:20.510 --> 04:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
there is an easy way to turn around and
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
do an extension to an existing contract
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that that's a
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
non-starter I do think if this program
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
were to continue beyond that right a
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
longer time period is what you'd need to
 
04:33:34.490 --> 04:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
put it out to the mcos
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
um regarding the for-profit profit
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Cancer Centers and and
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
other alternate types of treatment and
 
04:33:44.631 --> 04:33:44.641 align:start position:0%
this is at some level to what Dr Nagel
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
or representative Nagel mentioned
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
um we should be encouraging alternate
 
04:33:49.199 --> 04:33:50.750 align:start position:0%
um we should be encouraging alternate
Solutions

04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
04:33:52.369 --> 04:33:52.379 align:start position:0%
um for people who want to run private
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
practices for hospitals that want to
 
04:33:57.470 --> 04:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
start up unfortunately current statutes
 
04:33:59.570 --> 04:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
prohibit starting another hospital
 
04:34:02.209 --> 04:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
within Manchester that is a for-profit
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
hospital or is a Cancer Treatment Center
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
or something that's a specialty for
 
04:34:10.849 --> 04:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
um pick discipline of choice I guess so
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the things we need to do in
 
04:34:14.449 --> 04:34:14.459 align:start position:0%
terms of tweaking the program is to
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
start to allow additional competition to
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
the system for those who want to expand
 
04:34:19.199 --> 04:34:20.810 align:start position:0%
the system for those who want to expand
that

04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:20.820 --> 04:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:25.250 --> 04:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
as a general rule we get what we reward
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
if we we reward people to be on the
 
04:34:30.769 --> 04:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
program and we encourage that by giving
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
them benefits it will drive people into
 
04:34:36.051 --> 04:34:36.061 align:start position:0%
the system we saw a huge uptick during
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
the covid crisis because we removed some
 
04:34:41.631 --> 04:34:41.641 align:start position:0%
of the barriers to entry into the
 
04:34:43.730 --> 04:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
program and in a very short period of
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
time it almost doubled in size
 
04:34:48.890 --> 04:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
what may be a better thing is to figure
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
out how to incentivize people so there
 
04:34:52.609 --> 04:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
isn't a step function I understand the
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
issues of Step functions as an engineer
 
04:34:57.890 --> 04:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
so that they don't face the if I work an
 
04:35:01.010 --> 04:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
extra hour or I change jobs I lose my
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
health care that's a real problem and
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've encouraged that problem by by the
 
04:35:08.570 --> 04:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
statutes that we've set up
 
04:35:11.330 --> 04:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
um to the member from Walpole right
 
04:35:13.369 --> 04:35:13.379 align:start position:0%
preventative care is a much better place
 
04:35:16.369 --> 04:35:16.379 align:start position:0%
to put money than it is in reaction to
 
04:35:19.131 --> 04:35:19.141 align:start position:0%
health issues that have been delayed so
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
all of those weigh into it but just
 
04:35:24.529 --> 04:35:24.539 align:start position:0%
pushing the program forward in another
 
04:35:26.689 --> 04:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
two years four years five years six
 
04:35:28.269 --> 04:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
years I've heard all sorts of numbers
 
04:35:31.070 --> 04:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited doesn't solve the core issues
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
with the problem and I I mean I have
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
amendments we can introduce today if
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back I bring those
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
back but I believe there are all of
 
04:35:39.650 --> 04:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
these elements need to be discussed in
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
the program
 
04:35:43.849 --> 04:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
I saw a representative Merchant with his
 
04:35:43.859 --> 04:35:45.310 align:start position:0%
I saw a representative Merchant with his
hand

04:35:45.310 --> 04:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:35:48.131 --> 04:35:48.141 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to listen to the
 
04:35:50.160 --> 04:35:52.131 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to listen to the
conversation

04:35:52.131 --> 04:35:52.141 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is three fundamental
 
04:35:56.330 --> 04:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
things going on all the same time one is
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
we have a social problem
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
you have an economic problem we have a
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
systems problem
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to solve the social
 
04:36:03.840 --> 04:36:05.029 align:start position:0%
we're not going to solve the social
problem

04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
04:36:08.929 --> 04:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
we're not going to solve the system
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill we have a
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
fragmented care
 
04:36:15.051 --> 04:36:15.061 align:start position:0%
fragmented coverage lack of Standards
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
lack of portability
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
your health insurance unfortunately a
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of times it's tied to your job and
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be that way but that's
 
04:36:26.631 --> 04:36:26.641 align:start position:0%
another societal issue
 
04:36:28.131 --> 04:36:28.141 align:start position:0%
but we do also have something called
 
04:36:29.570 --> 04:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
economics one of the things that caught
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
my attention
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
was when Senator Bradley was here
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
the impact has had in lowering health
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
care premiums for the employers
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
so the economic side of the equation has
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
really caught my attention
 
04:36:46.250 --> 04:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
as far as the mcos to representative
 
04:36:46.260 --> 04:36:47.810 align:start position:0%
as far as the mcos to representative
polls

04:36:47.810 --> 04:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
polls
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right if I was a
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
business owner and trying to make a bid
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
on the contract
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any Assurance or even
 
04:36:58.250 --> 04:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
the intent for the legislative body
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
to have at least a five-year Horizon why
 
04:37:04.010 --> 04:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
would I bid on a contract
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
if we don't have people bidding on the
 
04:37:05.879 --> 04:37:07.250 align:start position:0%
if we don't have people bidding on the
contracts

04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
04:37:09.769 --> 04:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
the intent of us financially will be
 
04:37:09.779 --> 04:37:11.150 align:start position:0%
the intent of us financially will be
significant

04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
at the minimum we have to have a
 
04:37:16.490 --> 04:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
five-year Horizon
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
in reality Senator I mean a president
 
04:37:22.849 --> 04:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
who ever said represent whatever
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
Department around here is a misnomer
 
04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
I learned a long time ago in my first
 
04:37:29.689 --> 04:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
term in the house
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
permanent is two years
 
04:37:35.090 --> 04:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
because any subsequent legislative body
 
04:37:38.929 --> 04:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
can change whatever the prior ones do so
 
04:37:41.209 --> 04:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
the word permanent really is not
 
04:37:44.330 --> 04:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
permanent it's only telegraphing if you
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
will to the marketplace our intent
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
is to make this at least long term to
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
allow for those who are out there the
 
04:37:51.959 --> 04:37:53.090 align:start position:0%
allow for those who are out there the
mcos

04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
mcos
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
to sharpen their pencils and bring it
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
back to us in a financial way it's not
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to go away
 
04:38:02.689 --> 04:38:02.699 align:start position:0%
but if you want to be sure we have the
 
04:38:05.570 --> 04:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
best contracts on the table I think it's
 
04:38:07.490 --> 04:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
in front of us to ensure that we
 
04:38:10.010 --> 04:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
Telegraph to the marketplace the intent
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
of this legislative body to make it for
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
at least five years I'd like to see it
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
for 10 years but that's kind of where
 
04:38:18.650 --> 04:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from and number two the
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
workforce we keep forgetting about the
 
04:38:23.330 --> 04:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
fact that when people are healthy and
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
get their care taken care of they
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
contribute to the workforce I've heard
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
time and time again
 
04:38:33.529 --> 04:38:33.539 align:start position:0%
we have a Workforce crisis if we can
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
find ways to get people back into the
 
04:38:35.279 --> 04:38:36.529 align:start position:0%
find ways to get people back into the
workforce

04:38:36.529 --> 04:38:36.539 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
can help us become more productive
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
that drives the engine which drives our
 
04:38:43.369 --> 04:38:43.379 align:start position:0%
economy so for all those reasons we
 
04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
can't solve the social problems I'd like
 
04:38:47.689 --> 04:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
to we can't solve the citizens problem
 
04:38:49.310 --> 04:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
but we can definitely solve the economic
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
ones thank you
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Shapiro and then
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
04:38:58.131 --> 04:38:58.141 align:start position:0%
um I just want to comment on this idea
 
04:39:00.410 --> 04:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
that because we have expanded medicaid
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
that people
 
04:39:01.799 --> 04:39:03.470 align:start position:0%
that people
um

04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:05.689 --> 04:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
you know since we have it it's an
 
04:39:07.849 --> 04:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
incentive to go on expanded medicaid or
 
04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and then since it's difficult
 
04:39:10.740 --> 04:39:12.769 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and then since it's difficult
to

04:39:12.769 --> 04:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:15.051 --> 04:39:15.061 align:start position:0%
um work and get the same benefits that
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
people don't go off of it and um
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that's never a problem
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
um but I think the
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um previous speaker prior to the
 
04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
previous speaker referred to the
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
ballooning of the number of people on
 
04:39:32.330 --> 04:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid because they ease the
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility standards to get on Medicaid
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
 
04:39:39.890 --> 04:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
not accurate the federal government made
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
a rule that nobody could expire for
 
04:39:45.410 --> 04:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and therefore the numbers and
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot of people laid off
 
04:39:48.770 --> 04:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of covid so all those
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
people even if they went back to work
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
um even if they were earning enough
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
money to no longer
 
04:39:57.650 --> 04:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
um even if they didn't fill out the
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
paperwork to get renewed
 
04:40:03.170 --> 04:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
um by federal law couldn't be expired so
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
the number did go up from
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure Mr Littman knows but something like
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
from sixty thousand or fifty five
 
04:40:12.170 --> 04:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
thousand to ninety thousand that's true
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
and that's being addressed right now and
 
04:40:17.570 --> 04:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
people the number will go back down and
 
04:40:19.730 --> 04:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
so it's not because people
 
04:40:22.970 --> 04:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
saw an opportunity to go on the Dole and
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
they went on the Dole um it was a
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
federal ruling that we had no control
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
over so there were
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
temporarily more people on expanded
 
04:40:31.920 --> 04:40:34.250 align:start position:0%
temporarily more people on expanded
medicaid

04:40:34.250 --> 04:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
04:40:37.490 --> 04:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
make one observation that we should
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
really be proud of um I looked at
 
04:40:44.448 --> 04:40:44.458 align:start position:0%
Medicaid participation rates Medicaid
 
04:40:46.850 --> 04:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid in the United States
 
04:40:48.650 --> 04:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
and actually New Hampshire is number one
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
we have about an 87 percent Medicaid
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
expansion rate which is or part Medicaid
 
04:40:55.610 --> 04:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
participation right it was pretty
 
04:40:55.620 --> 04:40:57.230 align:start position:0%
participation right it was pretty
amazing

04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
um with that said I think the reason why
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a 10-year thing or
 
04:41:04.448 --> 04:41:04.458 align:start position:0%
whatever is this
 
04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid on especially managed Medicaid
 
04:41:10.910 --> 04:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
really unnecessarily increases our costs
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
and getting representative Murphy what
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
you what I'm kind of getting back to is
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of the Medicaid patients I see I
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
know they're going to cost more than I
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
get so you know I do I just don't even
 
04:41:22.610 --> 04:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
charge Medicaid I don't even bother it's
 
04:41:24.890 --> 04:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
not worth my time energy or Hassle and I
 
04:41:26.208 --> 04:41:26.218 align:start position:0%
just don't think it should be that way
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
but I do think there's there's some very
 
04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
simple fixes that maybe this commission
 
04:41:33.890 --> 04:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
can do to improve the way that they
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
interact with us as doctors as all the
 
04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers do they can use them
 
04:41:40.368 --> 04:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
as role models and they can decrease our
 
04:41:42.410 --> 04:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
unnecessary costs and make this product
 
04:41:44.990 --> 04:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
project more viable but I did want to
 
04:41:46.610 --> 04:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
point out one other thing these are two
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely wonderful documents that I
 
04:41:50.208 --> 04:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
kind of think I talked to people one
 
04:41:52.010 --> 04:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
year is the New Hampshire 10-year Mental
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
Health Plan and the other ones the
 
04:41:56.750 --> 04:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
governor is Commission on Alcohol and
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs and the really beautiful
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
documents like representative Miracles
 
04:42:03.770 --> 04:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
call your doctor again represent a
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
merchandise I have basically fixed the
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
entire Health Care system for people
 
04:42:09.650 --> 04:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
with chronic pain we did at today while
 
04:42:12.170 --> 04:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
you were doing whatever you were doing
 
04:42:12.180 --> 04:42:13.070 align:start position:0%
you were doing whatever you were doing
um

04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but basically what we did was we
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
outlined a system and that's what these
 
04:42:18.890 --> 04:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
two things do and prevention is a huge
 
04:42:18.900 --> 04:42:19.970 align:start position:0%
two things do and prevention is a huge
element

04:42:19.970 --> 04:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
element
 
04:42:19.980 --> 04:42:20.690 align:start position:0%
element
um

04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
um in this and and that's important but
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
then they come to the conclusion is that
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
their primary payer mix is Medicaid and
 
04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid they cannot cover their
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
costs and they cannot do whatever they
 
04:42:34.250 --> 04:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
need to do so the critical thing is yeah
 
04:42:36.050 --> 04:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
Medicaid needs to be important part of
 
04:42:37.970 --> 04:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
what we do going forward but we do need
 
04:42:40.690 --> 04:42:40.700 align:start position:0%
to accept that at some point is too much
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
that our systems will not survive our
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
health care providers will not provide
 
04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
if the payer mix goes over a certain
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
percentage and we really need to
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand that as we go forward and not
 
04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
just talk about extensions and things
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
like that but also talk about limits
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
there I'm done
 
04:43:01.128 --> 04:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
uh representative McLean
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam chair so I I think
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know representative Merchant you you
 
04:43:09.530 --> 04:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
are correct what is prominent I mean
 
04:43:11.448 --> 04:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
permanent may be just the next
 
04:43:14.570 --> 04:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
legislature but if we look at history
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid was expanding was brought in
 
04:43:21.170 --> 04:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
in 2014 for two years nobody talked
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
about it until the two years and then it
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
was extended again until 2018 for two
 
04:43:28.368 --> 04:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
years nobody talked about it again for
 
04:43:30.730 --> 04:43:30.740 align:start position:0%
two years then we brought it in in 2018
 
04:43:34.490 --> 04:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
for five years and it went silent the
 
04:43:37.368 --> 04:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
debate went silent until the five years
 
04:43:37.378 --> 04:43:39.050 align:start position:0%
debate went silent until the five years
so

04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:41.330 --> 04:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
based on history I understand the
 
04:43:42.770 --> 04:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
permanence is relative within the
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
legislature but based in his based on
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
history the discussion flares up at at
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
those terminating points and so I think
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
everything that representative Murphy
 
04:43:56.690 --> 04:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
said is correct there's value in having
 
04:43:59.810 --> 04:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
some compensation versus nothing there's
 
04:44:01.850 --> 04:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
value and understanding that I have
 
04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
insurance so that you know I can go in
 
04:44:07.128 --> 04:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
and not avoid care all those things and
 
04:44:09.410 --> 04:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
the reduced costs to the employees that
 
04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
you talked about there's value in all
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
these things but you know again we're
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be looking at the health
 
04:44:19.250 --> 04:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
care as a whole Mosaic and if you heard
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
the comment from representative she's
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
talking about her her hair stylists you
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
know these are working people and they
 
04:44:31.010 --> 04:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
said but they need Medicaid because the
 
04:44:33.368 --> 04:44:33.378 align:start position:0%
exchanges just aren't working for them
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
and realistically long term
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
um we need to to have that working I
 
04:44:43.128 --> 04:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
know in this committee we heard a whole
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of testimony and as part of
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
orientation on Medicaid I didn't really
 
04:44:50.208 --> 04:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
hear anything about how the exchanges
 
04:44:52.610 --> 04:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
work there's a lot of siloing I think
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
going on with respect to you know I
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if the Commerce Community
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
really understands a lot about the
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid part we certainly don't
 
04:45:02.690 --> 04:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
understand a lot about the exchanges but
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
all of these discussions have to happen
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
and I think you know we need to
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
understand what these fixes are
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
before we can go forward and say yeah
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is it and so I understand your
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
comment about permanence but for me
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
history tells a lot about what the
 
04:45:23.330 --> 04:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
problem is going to be and if we extend
 
04:45:25.850 --> 04:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
this thing indefinitely as I said we're
 
04:45:27.650 --> 04:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
going to move on to other things is my
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
fear and so I think it's it's really
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
time time to time to hold back on on the
 
04:45:37.250 --> 04:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
permanent for now I I still believe that
 
04:45:39.410 --> 04:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
04:45:42.650 --> 04:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
Seth King thank you madam chair
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
I wasn't originally gonna say anything
 
04:45:46.368 --> 04:45:46.378 align:start position:0%
because you guys already know how I feel
 
04:45:48.170 --> 04:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
about all this stuff but
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I'll just make a few points
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
um that I've come up with by listening
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
to everybody even the U.S military
 
04:45:55.970 --> 04:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
budget isn't permanent every couple
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
years they have to go back and get a
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
renewal so if they have to get a renewal
 
04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
every two years I think so should
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
um so should this and to address
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's point about
 
04:46:06.000 --> 04:46:07.610 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's point about
permanency

04:46:07.610 --> 04:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
permanency
 
04:46:10.250 --> 04:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
um you're right that we can't bind a
 
04:46:13.010 --> 04:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
future governing body but there's a
 
04:46:16.610 --> 04:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
caveat and that is in order to end this
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
program in the future it would take it
 
04:46:20.810 --> 04:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
would take the agreement of the house
 
04:46:22.610 --> 04:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the governor it would
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
take all three bodies to agree to end it
 
04:46:28.128 --> 04:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
or even change it whereas if we do it
 
04:46:30.650 --> 04:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
piecemeal then if there is a problem
 
04:46:33.410 --> 04:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
with it it would take it would
 
04:46:35.090 --> 04:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
incentivize those bodies to work
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
together and make the changes or if one
 
04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
body couldn't come into agreement the
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
program ends so that's that's how the
 
04:46:43.490 --> 04:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
the permanency does make a difference
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that it requires all
 
04:46:48.530 --> 04:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
agreements all the time whereas
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's not permanent anyways
 
04:46:53.570 --> 04:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
already explained that um so
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
um if the entitlement is permanent
 
04:46:58.730 --> 04:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
um people will internalize that and they
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
will act accordingly
 
04:47:01.850 --> 04:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
um if there's an entitlement that they
 
04:47:03.530 --> 04:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
think might go away they're going to
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
think to themselves well I can't get too
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable because it can go away so I
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
need to take care of myself but once it
 
04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
becomes permanent people
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
um respond to incentives and they'll
 
04:47:14.810 --> 04:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
think to themselves oh I got it made I
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't need to work too hard to become
 
04:47:16.920 --> 04:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
don't need to work too hard to become
self-sufficient

04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and then a question I have is what
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
percentage of people would be too many
 
04:47:26.510 --> 04:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
people to have on Medicaid can anybody
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
answer that for me and will it
 
04:47:29.160 --> 04:47:30.590 align:start position:0%
answer that for me and will it
permanently

04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
um in expanding the Medicaid will that
 
04:47:36.650 --> 04:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
increase the number of people on on the
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and then a couple last points
 
04:47:41.570 --> 04:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
and that is to address another thing a
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said we could
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
fix the economic problem of Workforce
 
04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
shortage really quickly if we got rid of
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
all of the entire entitlements because
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
you would find people coming out of the
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
work all of a sudden willing and able to
 
04:47:58.330 --> 04:47:58.340 align:start position:0%
work I guarantee it and then lastly
 
04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
people are always talking about how hard
 
04:48:02.690 --> 04:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
it is to live and I think that if you
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
are a net taxpayer it is becoming
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
increasingly hard to live but when I
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
look around and I see obesity epidemics
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
and drug abuse problems I'm thinking to
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
myself life has become too easy it's too
 
04:48:17.570 --> 04:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
easy if we can sit around with all of
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
this Leisure Time and even the poor
 
04:48:21.170 --> 04:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
people I know have expensive expensive
 
04:48:23.810 --> 04:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
cell phones and TVs and cars and Leisure
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
Time I'm thinking to myself it's way too
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
easy get these people back to work get
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
them off the drugs stop them from
 
04:48:30.890 --> 04:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
sitting on the couch and eating
 
04:48:34.250 --> 04:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
themselves to death so yeah I don't
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
think what we need is more entitlements
 
04:48:36.890 --> 04:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
I think we need to get rid of all that
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
stuff and you will automatically see
 
04:48:40.610 --> 04:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
people become self-sufficient I promise
 
04:48:43.010 --> 04:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tellez you had
 
04:48:44.810 --> 04:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
your hand up yeah hi
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you and there's no that's shared
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
here and I don't have a lot of
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
as much off the top of my head as I did
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
when I worked at the Department of
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
04:48:57.050 --> 04:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
um but I don't really know people who
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
are sitting around and that's why
 
04:49:00.650 --> 04:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
they're obese right we have issues with
 
04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
food security with the quality of food
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
that's available that's affordable
 
04:49:06.298 --> 04:49:07.730 align:start position:0%
that's available that's affordable
um that

04:49:07.730 --> 04:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:49:10.128 --> 04:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
um they're busy working two jobs and so
 
04:49:12.050 --> 04:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
they don't have time to go for a walk or
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood they live in is not
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
walkable for a variety of reasons and so
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a lot of complexity
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that someone broke out
 
04:49:23.208 --> 04:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
there's many many problems that were you
 
04:49:24.890 --> 04:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
know thinking this one bill is going to
 
04:49:27.650 --> 04:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
fix and that's not realistic so you'll
 
04:49:29.810 --> 04:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
recall the reason we had the affordable
 
04:49:31.250 --> 04:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
character in the first place was because
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
Insurance being one of the most
 
04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
profitable Industries in the country was
 
04:49:36.770 --> 04:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
making it so that employers couldn't
 
04:49:38.448 --> 04:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
afford to cover their workers anymore
 
04:49:40.970 --> 04:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
and people who worked couldn't afford to
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
uptake insurance that was offered to
 
04:49:45.050 --> 04:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
them and these are people who work often
 
04:49:49.128 --> 04:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
more than one job and so I think that um
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
I agree with the comment that was made
 
04:49:54.650 --> 04:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people who represent a lot
 
04:49:56.330 --> 04:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
of the hundred thousand people who are
 
04:49:58.850 --> 04:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
covered came and spoke before this body
 
04:50:00.890 --> 04:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
and provided a lot of information about
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
how this has really helped New Hampshire
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
we had an opiate crisis we were
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
embarrassingly number one in the country
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
or number two in the country for opioid
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
deaths like that was horrible and
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion provided behavioral
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
health coverage in a way that had not
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
been provided previously it's allowed
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
people to at least have a minimum
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
Assurance to be able to get care when
 
04:50:24.050 --> 04:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
they need it you know hopefully yes
 
04:50:25.550 --> 04:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's issues with getting in but
 
04:50:27.650 --> 04:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully have some ability to take care
 
04:50:29.690 --> 04:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
of their health so they can work people
 
04:50:31.850 --> 04:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
want to work I've always worked in
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
places where people struggle they want
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
to work they need to be able to get care
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
if they need it and not be straddled
 
04:50:43.368 --> 04:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
with as we remember previously also
 
04:50:45.890 --> 04:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
being bankrupted by Health bills which
 
04:50:48.410 --> 04:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
is also another significant problem and
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to go ahead and Echo that
 
04:50:55.010 --> 04:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
I agree that that there's been a lot of
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
good thinking and information provided
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
as well as data provided about how this
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
has benefited New Hampshire it's made us
 
04:51:04.810 --> 04:51:04.820 align:start position:0%
have a stronger
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
economy it's provided for a stronger
 
04:51:08.628 --> 04:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
Workforce and taking it away will just
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
make things worse and not better and
 
04:51:14.208 --> 04:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
agree that you can't contract out this
 
04:51:16.970 --> 04:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
issue of trying to issue contracts for
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
um uh you know whoever will be the
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
vendors just is impossible if we don't
 
04:51:23.690 --> 04:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
at least have a reasonable time Horizon
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant
 
04:51:28.730 --> 04:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
the answer to representative King's
 
04:51:33.050 --> 04:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
comment how many people in Medicaid is
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
too many
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'd say one because what that means is
 
04:51:39.170 --> 04:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
as a society we're not providing them
 
04:51:41.930 --> 04:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do it themselves
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
which means you're probably not employed
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
appropriately they're probably working
 
04:51:47.150 --> 04:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
what are called corporate welfare
 
04:51:48.770 --> 04:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
working for
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
companies that pay them a minimum wage
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore we're subsidizing at
 
04:51:54.770 --> 04:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
minimal wage which is what I call
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare
 
04:51:59.530 --> 04:51:59.540 align:start position:0%
and also would remind people
 
04:52:03.170 --> 04:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
and every single barrel whatever we're
 
04:52:05.208 --> 04:52:05.218 align:start position:0%
looking at there's always going to be
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
five or ten percent of those people in
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
that Barrel that don't belong there
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
rotten apples
 
04:52:13.250 --> 04:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
however and I'm not going to take the
 
04:52:15.288 --> 04:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
whole barrel and throw it out because
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
the five or ten percent in there that
 
04:52:18.288 --> 04:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
are rotten
 
04:52:20.208 --> 04:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
just because I want to get rid of the
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
five or ten percent there's ninety
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
percent of the people probably 95 of the
 
04:52:24.360 --> 04:52:25.850 align:start position:0%
percent of the people probably 95 of the
people

04:52:25.850 --> 04:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
that don't really want to be there but
 
04:52:30.410 --> 04:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
they have no choice but to be there so
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
from society point of view I'll remind
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
people that it's not looking at it
 
04:52:37.368 --> 04:52:37.378 align:start position:0%
strictly in the end of the five or ten
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
percent and trying to figure out how to
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
eliminate that
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
without understanding we're having an
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
impacting of the 90 to 95 percent
 
04:52:46.970 --> 04:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
so yes one is probably too many because
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's an indication from our society
 
04:52:51.770 --> 04:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
that we are not giving those people the
 
04:52:51.780 --> 04:52:53.090 align:start position:0%
that we are not giving those people the
opportunity

04:52:53.090 --> 04:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they deserve to earn a living
 
04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
for them to be off the system
 
04:53:00.190 --> 04:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
so those are my comments though
 
04:53:02.930 --> 04:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
um I just I'm going to talk and
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
supportive people on Medicaid um there's
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of like a lot of other
 
04:53:12.530 --> 04:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
things socially you can't look at them
 
04:53:14.330 --> 04:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
as a homogeneous group of people it's
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
very heterogeneous and the people that
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
I've looked at are taking care of most
 
04:53:19.610 --> 04:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
of my career people with severe
 
04:53:22.128 --> 04:53:22.138 align:start position:0%
disabilities spinal cord injury head
 
04:53:24.410 --> 04:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
injury you know people like that that is
 
04:53:26.330 --> 04:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
really disabled and and they need this
 
04:53:28.970 --> 04:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
to survive on um that's another long
 
04:53:28.980 --> 04:53:30.110 align:start position:0%
to survive on um that's another long
story

04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
story
 
04:53:31.850 --> 04:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
um but like the Medicaid expansion
 
04:53:33.770 --> 04:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
program what it did
 
04:53:35.990 --> 04:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
was it gave Insurance to a whole group
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
of people that didn't have enough money
 
04:53:40.730 --> 04:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
to afford insurance
 
04:53:41.810 --> 04:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
um weren't getting it through their
 
04:53:44.570 --> 04:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
workplace but most almost all the
 
04:53:46.910 --> 04:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients ICM Medicaid expansion
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
actually are working and some of them
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
more than one job so I don't think we
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
have to really remember like who we're
 
04:53:55.010 --> 04:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:53:56.868 --> 04:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
I I did want to answer your one question
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what the answer is
 
04:54:01.010 --> 04:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
but um I would be very uncomfortable if
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent of my payer mix was
 
04:54:03.000 --> 04:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent of my payer mix was
Medicaid

04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
um I I think once you get over that
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
number you're you're really starting to
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
strain your resources
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
um and I would really like to work with
 
04:54:13.550 --> 04:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid managed plans to figure out
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
a way to cut their demands on us that we
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
can cut our costs so maybe we can see
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
more than that but right now it's not a
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
functional system
 
04:54:22.970 --> 04:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
04:54:25.628 --> 04:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo
 
04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh we hear a lot that this bill won't
 
04:54:33.470 --> 04:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
fix all problems but I think we are
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
focusing on financing too much and uh we
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
need to focus more on science-based
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
medicine and it's a lot of financing
 
04:54:45.170 --> 04:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
more than a half a billion dollars on
 
04:54:47.868 --> 04:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
the table and we are getting too excited
 
04:54:51.410 --> 04:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
when we hear that 90 percent of it will
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
come from federal government so we don't
 
04:54:58.610 --> 04:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
have pay for it but on one hand like
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
somebody still have to pay for it and
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
it's aspects press but also it comes
 
04:55:07.150 --> 04:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
 
04:55:10.390 --> 04:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
strengths attached so when we talk about
 
04:55:13.208 --> 04:55:13.218 align:start position:0%
lack of Standards
 
04:55:17.708 --> 04:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
it's a part of it it's another Federal
 
04:55:23.208 --> 04:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
program that is expanding and sometimes
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's not is the best
 
04:55:31.190 --> 04:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh policies that goes along with it and
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
part of it might be regulatory caption
 
04:55:39.050 --> 04:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
but also it could be just uh things move
 
04:55:42.850 --> 04:55:42.860 align:start position:0%
slowly on federal level and
 
04:55:46.330 --> 04:55:46.340 align:start position:0%
like for example with uh
 
04:55:48.410 --> 04:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
adaptations like New Hampshire
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
dietitians maybe already up to current
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
science but they have to abide to the
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
federal uh whatever it's called board
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
that is very slow in implementing uh
 
04:56:10.010 --> 04:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
signs that is changing so I I think
 
04:56:12.288 --> 04:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
we are trying to implement work
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
requirements for participants and it's
 
04:56:17.690 --> 04:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
good but excuse me my language I think
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
we need to do work requirement on
 
04:56:23.448 --> 04:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
ourselves let's work on amendments for
 
04:56:25.090 --> 04:56:25.100 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
there are some problems that we can try
 
04:56:33.970 --> 04:56:33.980 align:start position:0%
to solve with this great vehicle and
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise some problems like higher
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
prices less prices like all this muscle
 
04:56:45.310 --> 04:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
like 50 cents on one dollar compensation
 
04:56:49.150 --> 04:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't help
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
our medical clients as a whole thank you
 
04:56:58.970 --> 04:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we we have
 
04:57:01.200 --> 04:57:03.550 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we we have
spoken

04:57:03.550 --> 04:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
04:57:07.250 --> 04:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
theoretically and extensively
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
um we have spoken globally and
 
04:57:10.320 --> 04:57:12.170 align:start position:0%
um we have spoken globally and
specifically

04:57:12.170 --> 04:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh and all of us have edited our
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
comments because all of us could speak
 
04:57:21.410 --> 04:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
my question is what are we going to do
 
04:57:25.320 --> 04:57:26.510 align:start position:0%
my question is what are we going to do
now

04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
um I are are we going to vote on
 
04:57:32.330 --> 04:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
amendments today do we want to give
 
04:57:36.050 --> 04:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
people more time to bring amendments uh
 
04:57:40.610 --> 04:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.610 --> 04:57:42.620 align:start position:0%
are you done
 
04:57:45.170 --> 04:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
what exactly are we going to do going
 
04:57:45.180 --> 04:57:47.288 align:start position:0%
what exactly are we going to do going
forward

04:57:47.288 --> 04:57:47.298 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:57:50.930 --> 04:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to solve alleles
 
04:57:54.530 --> 04:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
of society and we have a bill in front
 
04:57:55.550 --> 04:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
of us
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
and we have a process
 
04:58:01.368 --> 04:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to figure out what
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
your plan is for us
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
going forward or are we going to deal
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
with this today are we going to deal
 
04:58:09.670 --> 04:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:58:13.550 --> 04:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
at a later date what what's the plan
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure it is an early bill as one might
 
04:58:16.680 --> 04:58:18.590 align:start position:0%
sure it is an early bill as one might
expect

04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
expect
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and there are several amendments
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant has one
 
04:58:24.970 --> 04:58:24.980 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman has a few I guess
 
04:58:27.288 --> 04:58:27.298 align:start position:0%
and it looks like representative Leon
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
may have a couple uh so I I'm
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
we we're going to be meeting next week
 
04:58:35.090 --> 04:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh I suspect we might even be meeting
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
the week after I guess it's one week at
 
04:58:41.930 --> 04:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
a time uh so I'm I'm willing to I'm
 
04:58:44.330 --> 04:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sensing that we're not ready to
 
04:58:46.670 --> 04:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
really dispose of this bill today that's
 
04:58:49.550 --> 04:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
my sense but I'm open to input from the
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee I want to I want to consider
 
04:58:51.360 --> 04:58:52.550 align:start position:0%
committee I want to I want to consider
everybody's

04:58:52.550 --> 04:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
position and I'm thinking continue until
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
next week but representative you had
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
your hand up I would love to be able to
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
read all the amendments in the quiet of
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
my home
 
04:59:08.090 --> 04:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
um so I I would enjoy if we could have
 
04:59:10.128 --> 04:59:10.138 align:start position:0%
all the amendments to take home with us
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
tonight sure and and that makes sense
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Leia
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you um some of it is that this
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
is complex because I have one where it
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
just says to repeal one certain line of
 
04:59:24.170 --> 04:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
it but the the rationale behind it and
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind that I don't know
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
if anybody's gone and taken a deep dive
 
04:59:28.138 --> 04:59:29.650 align:start position:0%
if anybody's gone and taken a deep dive
into

04:59:29.650 --> 04:59:29.660 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:59:33.050 --> 04:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
rsa126-a which is the statute that is
 
04:59:37.250 --> 04:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
our Granite Advantage plan but that is
 
04:59:40.250 --> 04:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
a mess to put it nicely but if I if I'm
 
04:59:42.770 --> 04:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
at home I can look up that RSA and read
 
04:59:45.770 --> 04:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
it at my leisure to try and make sense
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then at least if I can read all
 
04:59:50.090 --> 04:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
these ahead of time I can come in you
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
know knowing what this is about further
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
explanation would help but
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I have trouble reading when it's
 
04:59:58.730 --> 04:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
noisy when everybody's talking whatever
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
I can just take this in much better if I
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
can read it in the quiet of my home
 
05:00:04.010 --> 05:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
given the importance of this issue we
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
need to consider every
 
05:00:09.050 --> 05:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
option and every learning style every
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and the direction of it I
 
05:00:12.410 --> 05:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
think so
 
05:00:14.448 --> 05:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm as guilty as anybody as of going on
 
05:00:20.930 --> 05:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
and on and being philosophical about
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
these issues but I think as we get into
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Amendments I think I would
 
05:00:26.930 --> 05:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if we had kind of a more
 
05:00:26.940 --> 05:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if we had kind of a more
structured

05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
structured
 
05:00:28.320 --> 05:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
structured
um

05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:31.850 --> 05:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
kind of debate and then vote
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether that's being
 
05:00:36.050 --> 05:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
time limited or people just paying
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
attention to be really focused on what
 
05:00:40.490 --> 05:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
they're saying that it's directed
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
directly at the amendment before us but
 
05:00:45.890 --> 05:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
we had some unstructured time some of
 
05:00:47.330 --> 05:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
our members had a meeting that they had
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
to attend and we we didn't want we'd
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
agree we would not have any you know any
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
votes during that period so that was
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
05:00:57.110 --> 05:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
going forward I think that would be
 
05:00:59.448 --> 05:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
perfect absolutely that's and that's how
 
05:01:01.250 --> 05:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
usually we we have proceeded
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
I appreciate uh and my thankful for
 
05:01:12.110 --> 05:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
those who give the Amendments uh
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
amendments ahead of time for us to read
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
it but at the same time some amendments
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
they they are based on how discussion
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
will go and uh what other amendments
 
05:01:27.530 --> 05:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
already submitted so
 
05:01:31.250 --> 05:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I would ask to allow all sorts of
 
05:01:31.260 --> 05:01:33.050 align:start position:0%
um I would ask to allow all sorts of
amendments

05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
like to submit them when they feel it's
 
05:01:36.120 --> 05:01:37.490 align:start position:0%
like to submit them when they feel it's
appropriate

05:01:37.490 --> 05:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
oh people can meet them ahead of time
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
they can write down questions and meet a
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
more meaningful discussion I think
 
05:01:45.050 --> 05:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
um did you yeah go ahead representative
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you Mr chairman part of it
 
05:01:48.890 --> 05:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
too is that depending on how this all
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
evolves I have some that I may not even
 
05:01:53.810 --> 05:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
offer and I don't want to inundate you
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
with all of these different points if
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's some points that there's no that
 
05:02:00.650 --> 05:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
that there's no appetite for because
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to put it together and
 
05:02:05.930 --> 05:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
deal with this big wildly bill
 
05:02:07.970 --> 05:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
um in one Amendment I'm trying to
 
05:02:09.708 --> 05:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
address each of the different points and
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
this is one where as we go on and have
 
05:02:13.610 --> 05:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
this conversation it's one of those
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
where it's very intertwined
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
and um so that that's why I just have a
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of a reluctance of just
 
05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
sending all of these different
 
05:02:22.730 --> 05:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
amendments and number one I'm waiting
 
05:02:24.890 --> 05:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
for still for drafting from OLS on some
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
of them
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
um and it's a process in order to do
 
05:02:29.330 --> 05:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
this because they do need explanation
 
05:02:32.288 --> 05:02:32.298 align:start position:0%
when they're introduced
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:02:36.650 --> 05:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
nobody can make anybody else share an
 
05:02:37.970 --> 05:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
amendment if they don't want to share it
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's privileged until you offer it to
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
the committee so
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
um perhaps we could take under
 
05:02:47.690 --> 05:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
advisement representative matter upham's
 
05:02:47.700 --> 05:02:49.010 align:start position:0%
advisement representative matter upham's
request

05:02:49.010 --> 05:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:02:49.020 --> 05:02:50.330 align:start position:0%
request
that

05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
I know I am very much in her Camp I
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
would be much more likely to look
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
favorably on an amendment if I've had
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
time to read it to think about it to
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
look up the statute
 
05:03:04.368 --> 05:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
and perhaps to ask questions of the
 
05:03:06.650 --> 05:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
sponsor if I have them
 
05:03:06.660 --> 05:03:07.310 align:start position:0%
sponsor if I have them
um

05:03:07.310 --> 05:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:07.320 --> 05:03:08.750 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:12.890 --> 05:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
you know people can do whatever they
 
05:03:15.650 --> 05:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
want to do and
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
I don't see that we have a lot of
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
control over it well let me ask this
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
question does anyone object those with
 
05:03:24.530 --> 05:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
amendments sharing them if they so
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
choose and we can
 
05:03:29.050 --> 05:03:29.060 align:start position:0%
I was at all or nothing it's just like a
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
we can't enforce no no I know I know but
 
05:03:34.010 --> 05:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to share an amendment
 
05:03:37.368 --> 05:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.378 --> 05:03:38.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:03:38.770 --> 05:03:38.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
is there any objections is there any
 
05:03:54.410 --> 05:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
Mr ship yes representative Hall
 
05:03:58.080 --> 05:03:58.850 align:start position:0%
Mr ship yes representative Hall
um

05:03:58.850 --> 05:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:00.890 --> 05:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
so in light of what we discussed this
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
morning relative to RSA 1449 and in
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
preparation for a potential amendment
 
05:04:10.368 --> 05:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been drafted do we also need
 
05:04:12.350 --> 05:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
to change the makeup of that committee
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:04:15.410 --> 05:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
and is that something we should be
 
05:04:17.208 --> 05:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
looking at having someone draft ahead of
 
05:04:17.218 --> 05:04:19.208 align:start position:0%
looking at having someone draft ahead of
time

05:04:19.208 --> 05:04:19.218 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
no no no no on 263 there is a committee
 
05:04:25.250 --> 05:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
made up of various people but the
 
05:04:28.368 --> 05:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
legislatures are not in the majority do
 
05:04:30.170 --> 05:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
we need to address that to be compliant
 
05:04:32.690 --> 05:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
with RSA I would say uh representative
 
05:04:32.700 --> 05:04:33.650 align:start position:0%
with RSA I would say uh representative
Weber

05:04:33.650 --> 05:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
05:04:37.250 --> 05:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think our researcher oh I'm sorry
 
05:04:38.810 --> 05:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
here she comes
 
05:04:38.820 --> 05:04:44.570 align:start position:0%
here she comes
yes

05:04:44.570 --> 05:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
so that Clause that says now I'm
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
standing 1449 has been a work-rounded in
 
05:04:52.730 --> 05:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
the middle that is what people notice to
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
get a commission that is not the new
 
05:04:57.410 --> 05:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
team that was put in the 2021 we hate it
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
but it's legal yes so it does not have
 
05:05:02.930 --> 05:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
to be a joke and it's the purview of I
 
05:05:04.490 --> 05:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
mean we're trying with the community of
 
05:05:04.500 --> 05:05:05.570 align:start position:0%
mean we're trying with the community of
commissions

05:05:05.570 --> 05:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
um to try and keep it
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
um building but it's not like it's it
 
05:05:12.890 --> 05:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
would pass the way it was it's it's a
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
problem for us but it's not illegal it's
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
not so we do not need a statute no you
 
05:05:17.700 --> 05:05:18.530 align:start position:0%
not so we do not need a statute no you
don't

05:05:18.530 --> 05:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
um although they try to enforce it but
 
05:05:22.730 --> 05:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's a word So based on practice and
 
05:05:24.610 --> 05:05:24.620 align:start position:0%
legal opinion
 
05:05:27.170 --> 05:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney like that's just
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing it's it's one of
 
05:05:30.288 --> 05:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
those loopholes that we're trying to
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
goals but have not so if that makes
 
05:05:33.650 --> 05:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
sense like it's nothing necessary
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
um with all you have going on it's not
 
05:05:37.310 --> 05:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
necessary if you wanted to do it I just
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
feel like it would bring that a lot more
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
work to hear
 
05:05:41.868 --> 05:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:44.990 --> 05:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
apparently we do not need to uh we do
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
not need to take care of that
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hall apparently there's a
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's a loophole involved that they're
 
05:05:51.770 --> 05:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
working on closing but it's not
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
something we need to do so
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon uh thank
 
05:05:59.628 --> 05:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um but however if we
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
feel that it's good policy to not give
 
05:06:04.128 --> 05:06:04.138 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding a certain RSA that was
 
05:06:07.690 --> 05:06:07.700 align:start position:0%
designed to control this type of uh
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
creep of um commissions from being a
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
legislative effort to one that's more
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
Community Based
 
05:06:16.250 --> 05:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
um that if we believe that we should
 
05:06:19.550 --> 05:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
stick with the intentions of RSA 1449
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
then it would be a good idea to draft an
 
05:06:23.930 --> 05:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
amendment and to do that I guess the
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
question is how many amendments do we
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
want to consider
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
all of the ones that are necessary to do
 
05:06:31.628 --> 05:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
our work that's fake enough
 
05:06:33.730 --> 05:06:33.740 align:start position:0%
representative whoever
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
I am recalling a committee where there
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.090 --> 05:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay I hope we don't beat the record
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
um other discussion
 
05:06:49.190 --> 05:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
all right so uh I
 
05:06:52.970 --> 05:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
will continue to 40 to next week is that
 
05:06:55.030 --> 05:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
a fair I mean
 
05:06:57.310 --> 05:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
263 rather
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this question of the makeup
 
05:07:02.570 --> 05:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
of the committee on 240 while you're
 
05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
around right it's currently consists of
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
Representative layout in Excel right
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's two members and representative
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
Merchant I hear you might want to be on
 
05:07:10.260 --> 05:07:10.970 align:start position:0%
Merchant I hear you might want to be on
that

05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay very good representative Nagel
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're busy on Tuesdays still as I
 
05:07:19.250 --> 05:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:21.410 --> 05:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh there's a meeting at what time 10 30
 
05:07:24.050 --> 05:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday were we able to secure a
 
05:07:28.690 --> 05:07:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.700 --> 05:07:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 240. Mr chairman we have we
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
have usually in this committee allowed
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
members who are not members of a
 
05:07:45.010 --> 05:07:45.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to sit in and
 
05:07:47.690 --> 05:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
participate they don't participate in
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
the voting but
 
05:07:54.970 --> 05:07:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.770 --> 05:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
 
05:07:57.780 --> 05:08:00.650 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
I

05:08:00.650 --> 05:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:05.208 --> 05:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm suggesting that if we have
 
05:08:07.610 --> 05:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
two people already and other people are
 
05:08:10.128 --> 05:08:10.138 align:start position:0%
sort of wanting to participate around
 
05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
the edges they're welcome to do so I I
 
05:08:14.330 --> 05:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
don't understand what you're talking
 
05:08:18.170 --> 05:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
about about an email oh to know exactly
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
what time these have to go in the
 
05:08:21.480 --> 05:08:23.890 align:start position:0%
what time these have to go in the
calendar

05:08:23.890 --> 05:08:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:27.410 --> 05:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
so you read your calendar and the
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
calendar says when it's meeting and what
 
05:08:29.638 --> 05:08:32.628 align:start position:0%
calendar says when it's meeting and what
room

05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.170 --> 05:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
um okay and again I I do representative
 
05:08:37.128 --> 05:08:37.138 align:start position:0%
way on
 
05:08:39.288 --> 05:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um this is one
 
05:08:41.690 --> 05:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
of the areas that is I think entirely
 
05:08:41.700 --> 05:08:43.550 align:start position:0%
of the areas that is I think entirely
non-partisan

05:08:43.550 --> 05:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
non-partisan
 
05:08:45.050 --> 05:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I actually would really like to see a
 
05:08:46.730 --> 05:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of myself representative
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
Weber and representative Merchant if
 
05:08:50.090 --> 05:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
there's no one else wanting to join us
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine but
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
um I I I think we do need to look for
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
all three of us to be available so if
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant isn't available
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday
 
05:08:59.810 --> 05:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
um I know we have we'll meet on
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we'll have session on Thursday
 
05:09:03.530 --> 05:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
we'll probably need to sleep on Friday
 
05:09:06.050 --> 05:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
to recover so it may be able to go into
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
next the following calendar
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
does that work with you yeah could the
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
other option could we possibly meet on
 
05:09:16.610 --> 05:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
Wednesday before this meeting no no
 
05:09:19.550 --> 05:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
okay so are we prepare to notice a
 
05:09:23.810 --> 05:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
meeting right now or just push it off to
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
the next calendar I think we'll notice
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
it in the following calendar
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
all right so I won't be it won't be in
 
05:09:32.810 --> 05:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
this calendar okay
 
05:09:34.730 --> 05:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
um any other business to come before us
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
today I I met um representative Leon I'm
 
05:09:39.770 --> 05:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
not sure what everything that may have
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
happened while I was gone earlier but um
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
we had skipped over our Senate Bill uh
 
05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
239 because
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I think our two most knowledgeable
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
two of our more knowledgeable committee
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
members on that had to go to their other
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
meeting so I think that
 
05:09:54.890 --> 05:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
um it would be good to see the
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
Amendments that Representatives Nagel
 
05:09:58.850 --> 05:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
and Merchant that representative Nagel
 
05:10:01.970 --> 05:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
has on Senate Bill 239 and to consider
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
that even if we do end up continuing it
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
that would be my advice I don't know
 
05:10:07.128 --> 05:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
what you'd like to do no that's fine
 
05:10:07.138 --> 05:10:08.628 align:start position:0%
what you'd like to do no that's fine
enjoy

05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
enjoy
 
05:10:10.610 --> 05:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
just just trying to get caught up on
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
when I was when we talked about it
 
05:10:15.410 --> 05:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
briefly in the hall but yes lots of
 
05:10:16.730 --> 05:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
moving pieces today representative
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I just want to get some clarity
 
05:10:23.208 --> 05:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
I I have another meeting to be at so are
 
05:10:26.208 --> 05:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
we are we not going to exec any more
 
05:10:29.208 --> 05:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
bills today or are we
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
well I I was thinking of a thing where
 
05:10:35.810 --> 05:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
239 ends up going but um you have you
 
05:10:39.770 --> 05:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
have to leave well I'll I'll stay if it
 
05:10:43.970 --> 05:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
if I I just needed to know okay
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
um I mean representative Nagel has three
 
05:10:48.650 --> 05:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
amendments so I I guess we have to
 
05:10:50.930 --> 05:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
we've continued so much today I I would
 
05:10:52.970 --> 05:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
hesitate to guarantee we will accept for
 
05:10:55.010 --> 05:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
other girls but uh what what we were
 
05:10:56.690 --> 05:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
told when you were out of the room was
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
that there was more discussion to be had
 
05:11:03.410 --> 05:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
even Beyond these amendments so
 
05:11:03.420 --> 05:11:04.270 align:start position:0%
even Beyond these amendments so
um

05:11:04.270 --> 05:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:07.550 --> 05:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
I you know I was one who came thinking
 
05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we were actually going to do all of
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
today and then and then you know I think
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're at a point of diminishing
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
returns frankly and we have till the
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
11th for two of the bills and we have
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
till June 1st for the rest of the bills
 
05:11:30.590 --> 05:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm you know in the in respect
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
to representative Shapiro's schedule I'm
 
05:11:33.770 --> 05:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is the ranking
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
member of I'm happy to defer any further
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
votes today if
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:46.440 --> 05:11:48.288 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
we were told that there were more things
 
05:11:52.970 --> 05:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
that needed to be done with 239 in
 
05:11:55.550 --> 05:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
addition to what's being passed out now
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
and representative Leon is nodding her
 
05:11:59.868 --> 05:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
head so I think she's one of the people
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
who wants to do more with it so I don't
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
see how we can vote on it today okay and
 
05:12:08.948 --> 05:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time so
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps coming back when we're all fresh
 
05:12:11.878 --> 05:12:13.250 align:start position:0%
perhaps coming back when we're all fresh
is

05:12:13.250 --> 05:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:12:16.190 --> 05:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and have read as much as people are
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
willing to share uh might be a good idea
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine we'll defer any further
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
can we also defer any further discussion
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
or are we going to have more discussion
 
05:12:31.010 --> 05:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
well I
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
um representative Nagel is there
 
05:12:33.410 --> 05:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
anything you want to say about these
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
amendments that you want to give people
 
05:12:37.128 --> 05:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
a chance to read them and
 
05:12:37.138 --> 05:12:40.670 align:start position:0%
a chance to read them and
um microphone

05:12:40.670 --> 05:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:40.680 --> 05:12:42.770 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

05:12:42.770 --> 05:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:12:42.780 --> 05:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
I I if I could just advertise them up
 
05:12:50.090 --> 05:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
front two of them are extremely basic
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
um but the one that's the most important
 
05:12:54.410 --> 05:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
or the most challenging is on the whole
 
05:12:56.208 --> 05:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction and should
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
this be in the bill or not because the
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
word harm reduction is not defined in
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
statute anywhere
 
05:13:03.770 --> 05:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
um so I've only been saved too by the
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
way the third one no there should be a
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
third one coming around okay I haven't
 
05:13:09.890 --> 05:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
that third one hasn't made it yet so
 
05:13:09.900 --> 05:13:11.530 align:start position:0%
that third one hasn't made it yet so
um

05:13:11.530 --> 05:13:11.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry to interrupt you no
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's all right I mean there's there's
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
three amendments the first one as you
 
05:13:34.550 --> 05:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
quite are aware of now I was very
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about the changing of the word
 
05:13:39.288 --> 05:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
of abuse to misuse and how that could
 
05:13:41.810 --> 05:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
adversely stigmatize people in pain that
 
05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually have legitimate use for these
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
medications so
 
05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
um mizo Higgins and I um sat down and
 
05:13:50.448 --> 05:13:50.458 align:start position:0%
crafted a statement that would allow
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
them to be accepted from that definition
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
um when um Senator Waters brought up the
 
05:13:59.090 --> 05:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
bill originally he had a CME requirement
 
05:14:01.128 --> 05:14:01.138 align:start position:0%
for doctors he was not aware that it
 
05:14:03.170 --> 05:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
already existed in rules so what we did
 
05:14:05.448 --> 05:14:05.458 align:start position:0%
was we just took what he wrote exit
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
output in what's in rules and actually
 
05:14:10.250 --> 05:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
what's in rules is substantially more um
 
05:14:13.250 --> 05:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
difficult than what he recommended and
 
05:14:16.250 --> 05:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
then the third one is um there again the
 
05:14:17.868 --> 05:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
whole issue of harm reduction is very
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
important for several people in this
 
05:14:21.170 --> 05:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
room and I
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
um uh Senator Waters came up with a
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation for defining that so I'm
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm submitting that on his behalf
 
05:14:31.368 --> 05:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:14:32.930 --> 05:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
are there any questions initial
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions on any of these I realize many
 
05:14:37.490 --> 05:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
of you want to read them and review them
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
and perhaps do some research before we
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
get into them in more detail but any
 
05:14:44.770 --> 05:14:44.780 align:start position:0%
preliminary questions right now for
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel representative Leon
 
05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and representative
 
05:14:51.890 --> 05:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
Nagel in light of some of my recent
 
05:14:54.050 --> 05:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
personal events I'm just curious if
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
there should be any protection for
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
people who are end of life as well as
 
05:15:00.530 --> 05:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
chronic pain patients so that they can
 
05:15:03.170 --> 05:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
get appropriate pain management if there
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
if we're more worried about their either
 
05:15:07.490 --> 05:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
ease of suffering while trying to
 
05:15:10.010 --> 05:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
survive versus an addiction that they'll
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
never live long enough to see yeah
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
that up I I was hoping that that um the
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
the one the thing we came up with would
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
accept them from that would be
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient but see what you're thinking
 
05:15:23.570 --> 05:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
if it's not we should talk about it I
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
mean it's like a huge issue um
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
this whole concept of opioid refugees
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
when we met with the speaker that was
 
05:15:32.810 --> 05:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that came up but we
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
asked me 15 million Americans benefit
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
from long-term opioid therapy and about
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
90 percent of them can't get access to
 
05:15:42.770 --> 05:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
it so guess where they go because they
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
either commit suicide they go without or
 
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
they go to the streets to get it and
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a rise in an unacceptable
 
05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
rise in suicide and people with chronic
 
05:15:51.298 --> 05:15:52.190 align:start position:0%
rise in suicide and people with chronic
pain

05:15:52.190 --> 05:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
pain
 
05:15:53.690 --> 05:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
um end of you brought up end of life
 
05:15:54.830 --> 05:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
care and I know you have a personal
 
05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
experience with that and so do I and
 
05:15:59.530 --> 05:15:59.540 align:start position:0%
it's just we're actually seeing adverse
 
05:16:02.810 --> 05:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
palliative and hospice care now so it's
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
extremely important when we when we go
 
05:16:07.070 --> 05:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
through these bills that we make sure
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
that that group of people does not
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by this so
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean that that's kind of My Hope
 
05:16:15.708 --> 05:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
and that we need to make sure that that
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
language gets perfect so if it's not let
 
05:16:20.830 --> 05:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
me know and then let's make sure it is
 
05:16:24.170 --> 05:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
now that I know how to make an amendment
 
05:16:25.970 --> 05:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's a dangerous skill for you to have
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
prior representative Weber
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add my voice to that
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
concern I had simply assumed that when
 
05:16:38.030 --> 05:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
we were talking about pain management it
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
would also adequately cover end of life
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
issues but
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the fortunate things about my
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
late husband's illness was it happened
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
from 1996 to 2000 when people were
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
willing to prescribe him Limitless
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
numbers of msir 15 so he could just take
 
05:17:02.830 --> 05:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what he needed when he needed it
 
05:17:05.810 --> 05:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
and didn't have to worry about either
 
05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
having a continuous medication which
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
kept him hazy and sick
 
05:17:13.970 --> 05:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
when he didn't need it and
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
we were lucky then and I know that that
 
05:17:20.448 --> 05:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen now and I am hoping that
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
we can get back to the point where end
 
05:17:27.288 --> 05:17:27.298 align:start position:0%
of life care really is something that
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
um we honor and help people deal with
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
their medications in the way that works
 
05:17:36.830 --> 05:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
best for them because some people do
 
05:17:39.170 --> 05:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
need the higher levels and higher Doses
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
and continuous doses but some people
 
05:17:44.930 --> 05:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
really didn't and and I know I would
 
05:17:47.330 --> 05:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
never have have the number of pills that
 
05:17:49.810 --> 05:17:49.820 align:start position:0%
I had on hand in the house now
 
05:17:52.970 --> 05:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
and the only mismanagement we ever did
 
05:17:55.128 --> 05:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
for those Hills was that the disposal
 
05:17:57.650 --> 05:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
method at the time was you flush them
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
down the John so I am responsible for
 
05:18:03.050 --> 05:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
many eight-legged frogs in the lower
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River Valley and I'm really
 
05:18:08.330 --> 05:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
mortified about that but the care was
 
05:18:10.730 --> 05:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
really good care and we need to go back
 
05:18:13.010 --> 05:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
to it you'd both bring up a really super
 
05:18:15.050 --> 05:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
important point because one of our
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is New Hampshire hospice
 
05:18:18.530 --> 05:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
and palliative care organization I've
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
worked with them for a long time and
 
05:18:22.610 --> 05:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
actually my origins in medicine were end
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
of life care so with these are all
 
05:18:26.090 --> 05:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
important issues to me but one of the
 
05:18:27.948 --> 05:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
things that we have been able to do very
 
05:18:31.128 --> 05:18:31.138 align:start position:0%
successfully so far is except
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
um end-of-life care from a lot of the
 
05:18:34.690 --> 05:18:34.700 align:start position:0%
statutes that we've done
 
05:18:37.250 --> 05:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
so so far we've been really successful
 
05:18:39.890 --> 05:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
the problem may be that you know I've
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
seen if you get the wrong person in the
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
wrong place at the wrong time you can
 
05:18:44.330 --> 05:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
screw that up
 
05:18:46.670 --> 05:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
so it may be important that we do
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
specify that um I think if you know the
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
more I think about it that is a good
 
05:18:53.930 --> 05:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
idea that we rate that specifically
 
05:18:55.550 --> 05:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing that up that's
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
really helpful representative
 
05:19:00.050 --> 05:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just passed out
 
05:19:01.970 --> 05:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
one of the Amendments I had several but
 
05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
one of the ones that um is eligible to
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
discuss please note that on line 14 the
 
05:19:10.970 --> 05:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
word and needs to be replaced with or
 
05:19:13.970 --> 05:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
the goal here was simply that if people
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
are on this program right they're either
 
05:19:18.770 --> 05:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
seeking help to get training this is
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
part of this transitional thing or
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're working not both minor drafting
 
05:19:25.550 --> 05:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
issues so it's not ready to submit with
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
we uh we did we did actually do we did a
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
lot today we we made it and I'm serious
 
05:19:39.530 --> 05:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
about this we made it through four bills
 
05:19:41.570 --> 05:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
we had some really good discussion on
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
others so we'll be continuing on the
 
05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
other five until next week now the ones
 
05:19:48.650 --> 05:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
we did complete today were Senate Bill
 
05:19:52.430 --> 05:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
85 Senate Bill 87 Senate Bill 171 and
 
05:19:55.128 --> 05:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 238. so
 
05:19:55.138 --> 05:20:00.410 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 238. so
um

05:20:00.410 --> 05:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
right I mean not that we can't um do
 
05:20:04.730 --> 05:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
anything with it but yeah there's a
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so representative Leon um
 
05:20:09.288 --> 05:20:09.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I think if you
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
may remember last week I had objected to
 
05:20:13.550 --> 05:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
the harm reduction language
 
05:20:15.650 --> 05:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
um in my Minority Report I do have
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
language about drug checking stations to
 
05:20:19.970 --> 05:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that Fentanyl and Xylitol
 
05:20:22.128 --> 05:20:22.138 align:start position:0%
which is the trunk can be identified
 
05:20:23.810 --> 05:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
both so that users aren't having
 
05:20:26.990 --> 05:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
unwanted adulteration and so that our
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and our Public Health can
 
05:20:31.310 --> 05:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
understand what's on the streets I've
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
spoken with a former former chairman of
 
05:20:36.170 --> 05:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
the police Chiefs Association around
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
that so I will distribute it to
 
05:20:40.550 --> 05:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
everybody I think that that narrows it
 
05:20:42.530 --> 05:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
down to a pressing need
 
05:20:44.448 --> 05:20:44.458 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm hopeful that I'll have
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
some support on that I just wanted to
 
05:20:47.208 --> 05:20:47.218 align:start position:0%
mention that because that's part of the
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
same harm reduction we're looking at but
 
05:20:50.570 --> 05:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
it's just narrowed in because of the
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
challenge of the definition so is that a
 
05:20:54.890 --> 05:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment then for the that bill
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's the minority Amendment so it'll be
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the calendar but yes it's one that's
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the floor okay thank you
 
05:21:03.170 --> 05:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
05:21:06.050 --> 05:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on it's it's either
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
a minority Amendment or it's a floor
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment if it's a minority Amendment
 
05:21:11.390 --> 05:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
and in the calendar it's a minority
 
05:21:13.250 --> 05:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment not a floor Amendment thank
 
05:21:14.930 --> 05:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
you for that four amendments are always
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the seat Pockets right usually
 
05:21:19.330 --> 05:21:19.340 align:start position:0%
usually yeah
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on any of the
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
business before the committee on these
 
05:21:24.240 --> 05:21:25.550 align:start position:0%
business before the committee on these
bills

05:21:25.550 --> 05:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:21:28.250 --> 05:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
if not we'll adjourn until 9 30 next
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
Wednesday thank you you know what's fun
 
05:21:31.200 --> 05:21:32.590 align:start position:0%
Wednesday thank you you know what's fun

05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
