00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
i think we'll have to make that
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
determination maybe about one o'clock or
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
1 30 or something of that nature as to
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
but it looks like
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
unless we're do our due diligence we're
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
not going to get through all the bills
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
today which means we will be coming back
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
here tomorrow
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
we we're looking at the weather
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
from all indications it looks like we're
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
in the area of two to four inches i know
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't apply to everybody
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh but we'll have to uh
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%

we'll
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%

other defenses to try to convince juries

to select a lesser includer offense of

when facing life in prison
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
to allow you to argue why your actions

may have been criminal but were not so
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
evil as to justify life in prison
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
i am probably the only member of this
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
general court who has actually had to
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
face life in prison for a justifiable
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
legally justifiable act
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
in my case the evidence showed that my
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
actions were completely justified
 
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.549 align:start position:0%
actions were completely justified
legally

who've attacked injured or even killed
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
another the need to present the whole
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
story the entire case warts and all to a
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
jury of their peers is truly a matter of
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
life and death
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
denying the accused a due process right
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
before a jury of their peers to try to
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
humanize or mitigate their actions
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
violates a fundamental due process right
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is older than this country itself
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
the article 15 right under our new
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution quote to be fully
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
heard in his defense by himself and
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
under separation of powers our role is
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
to protect rights not to erode them
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
we have never knowingly taken away a due
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
process right and this bill would be a
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent and a major
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
overreach on the part of the general
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
court but we may not regard the gay
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
panic defense as quote objectively
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable unquote the notion of a judge
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
telling a man accused that he cannot
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
speak in his own defense or that the
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
facts must be kept out only for
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%

manslaughter

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
manslaughter
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
is defined as when a person causes a
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
death of another while under the
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
influence of extreme mental or emotional
 
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.390 align:start position:0%
influence of extreme mental or emotional
disturbance

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
disturbance
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
caused by extreme
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
provocation by
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
which would otherwise constitute murder
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
this bill does not carve out a special
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
class for any any group of individuals
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is written would apply
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the lgbtq plus community as well as
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
but what would be happening
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
someone who is charged with murder would
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
be claiming that they were provoked
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
to commit the act of murder based on
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
such a defense i don't believe
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
is as reasonable to be raised in today's
 
00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.549 align:start position:0%
is as reasonable to be raised in today's
society

00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
society
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
realistically what this amounts to is a
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
mitigation defense in defenses to crimes
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
including murder are can be legally
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
defined for example
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
one cannot claim duress as a defense to
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
when this defense is raised
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the defendant raising it has already
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
conceded that they they killed someone
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
and they're simply trying to reduce
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
their charge from murder
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
to manslaughter
 
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.510 align:start position:0%
to manslaughter
essentially

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
the killer is claiming
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
that they should receive a lesser
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
sentence because they murdered someone
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
because of the victim's sexuality gender
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
or gender identity
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
and what makes it manslaughter was the
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
fact of that of how that person lives
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
their life
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
if the victim's sexuality gender or
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
gender identity serves as the motivation
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
to commit murder
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
it is it should not be acceptable
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
that that would actually lesser the
 
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.669 align:start position:0%
that that would actually lesser the
sentence

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
it actually serves as a motivation for
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
the crime they committed
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
to make matters worse while this would
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
play out in a courtroom
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
the victim's family who had a family
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
member murdered
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be sitting in the courtroom
 
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.110 align:start position:0%
would be sitting in the courtroom
listening

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
listening
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
to to the killer attempt to mitigate
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
their egregious behavior by presenting
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
what i would classify as otherwise a
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
hate speech
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
for that reason i don't believe that

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
the 1980s saw a wave of so-called get
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
tough on crime policies
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
these included mandatory minimums three
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
strike laws and a policy known as truth
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
and sentencing
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
which required that people serve a
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their minimum
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
sentence before being eligible for

parole
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
these 1980 policies were extreme
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
and we've spent the past few decades
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
walking them back
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
the committee passed legislation already
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
this section to remove some of the
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
remaining mandatory minimums that we
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
still have on the books here in new
 
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.150 align:start position:0%
still have on the books here in new
hampshire

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
this legislation would
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
reform our antiquated and extreme truth
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and sentencing policies
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
different states adopted different
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
versions of truth and sentencing
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire adopting the most
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
extreme option one hundred percent
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
while some states require people to
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
serve seventy or eighty percent and in
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
some cases sixty percent
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
this requirement has prevented new
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire from being able to grant time
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
off for good behavior
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
meaning for decades we have lacked the
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
ability to incentivize rehabilitation a
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
central purpose for incarceration
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
after punishment
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
moreover truth and sentencing have
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
resulted in people spending more time in
 
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
resulted in people spending more time in
prison

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
meaning a higher price tag for taxpayers
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
who must pay for every day someone
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
spends in prison
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
with one year in prison costing
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers roughly forty thousand dollars
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
truth incenting is expensive extreme and
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.630 align:start position:0%
truth incenting is expensive extreme and
outdated

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
outdated
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
many other states have repealed or
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
amended their truth and sentencing laws
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
including those states that have fewer
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
extreme versions to begin with
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
the 1980s notion that if we were just
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
extreme enough in our punishment
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
we could deter or even
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
in crime has been consistently disproven
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
extreme sentencing causes far more harm
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
than good
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
the goal of incarceration should be
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
punishment rehabilitation
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to amend our policies
 
00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
and we need to amend our policies
accordingly

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
hb 598 would amend our truth and
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
sentencing law to require that people
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
serve 50 percent of their minimum before
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
being eligible for parole
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
being eligible for parole does not mean
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
that a person will automatically be
 
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.309 align:start position:0%
that a person will automatically be
paroled

00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
paroled
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
it means they can apply
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
and the parole board will make a
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.079 --> 00:40:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's the other option whereas today
 
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
that's the other option whereas today
it's

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
all cases are treated pretty much the
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
same and there's no incentive incentive
 
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
same and there's no incentive incentive
to

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
do better or or work on your
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
incarceration or your rehabilitation
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
so this bill also starts with you're not
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
eligible to go before the parole board
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you have your minimum is less than
 
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.790 align:start position:0%
if you have your minimum is less than
five

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
five
years

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr speaker and i ask that
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
everyone press the red button
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
to vote against the bill
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
parole systems were designed to give
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
every incarcerated individual the
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn release and have a
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
fair transparent process for deciding
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are granted this
 
00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:28.230 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are granted this
release

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
release
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
over the years many states have reformed
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
the policies that would ensure
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
consistency and fairness and how they
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
identify those who should receive parole
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
when those individuals should be up for
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
another review for parole and what
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
parole conditions the individual must
 
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.589 align:start position:0%
parole conditions the individual must
follow

00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
if they even were to be released
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
remember people we are simply talking
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
about the right to a hearing
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill has been worked on by many
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
professional stakeholders criminal
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
criminal justice lawyers and our very
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
own criminal justice chair who was also
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
a sponsor on this bill
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
in good faith both sides of the aisle
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
came together to work on making this
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
process more just and fair we did this
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
because some of our laws have not been
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
updated in decades
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
we know this we recognize our
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility and role as legislators
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
to update outdated laws to protect our
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
citizens ensuring everyone is treated
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
the same in a system that was designed
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
to inspire hope and trust in the justice
 
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.630 align:start position:0%
to inspire hope and trust in the justice
system

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
by not updating these laws they do not
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
fit the times and we erode the
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
principles that allow our people to
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
trust that they will be treated fairly
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
not only was this a bipartisan bill it
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
was our last bill hearing for the year
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
and the only one we had that day
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
we met at 10 am to listen to an
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that would address concerns
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
held by all of us everyone was notified
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the amendment transparency had never
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
been in question since this bill had
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
been worked on for months by both
 
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.950 align:start position:0%
been worked on for months by both
parties

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
the hearing only consisted of two people
 
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.589 align:start position:0%
the hearing only consisted of two people
testifying

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
one of which
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
was speaking was a parole board member
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
upon asking them a series of questions
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
on how the parole system works we
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
learned several very important pieces of
 
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
learned several very important pieces of
information

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the only state in the
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
united states of america that requires
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
an inmate to serve 100 of their minimum
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
sentence before being eligible for a
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
parole hearing again this is just a
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
right to a hearing
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
we learned that in order to be eligible
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
for parole inmates must complete a
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
number of hours participating in classes
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
and rehabilitation activities to even
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
number three and this one was a kicker
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
the parole member on record informed us
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
that an inmate cannot even start classes
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
or other forms of rehabilitation
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
until a judge signs off on this request
 
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
can i be heard please
 
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.670 align:start position:0%
can i be heard please
[Music]

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
member does have a right to speak
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
remember may continue
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
the parole board member on record
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
informed us that an inmate cannot even
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
start classes or other forms of
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation until a judge signs off
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
on this request
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
they went on to say that not only are
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
there hundreds of backlogged cases there
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
would not be enough parole board members
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
to have these hearings proving that our
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
prisoners couldn't even start the parole
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
in good behavior rehabilitation programs
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
even if they wanted to
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
so not only are we denying people the
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
right to a hearing we are now denying
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
them the right to start the
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation process
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
what had once been a bipartisan lift a
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
group effort to do honest work and fix a
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
broken system for our people now divided
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
us because of staffing issues
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
in what world do you think it is
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
justifiable to deny someone the right to
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
a fair shake and strip them of their due
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
process because there are simply not
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
enough staff
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan bill that would have
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
updated an old law bringing us up to the
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
standards of all other 50 states a bill
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
that would simply offer a person the
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
right to a hearing due process is not a
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
partisan issue it affects us all the
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
justice system was designed to uphold
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
fairness and equality that we all have a
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
right to because without that fairness
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
what is the point
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
that day my colleagues voted to strip
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
the citizens of their due process rights
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
because of staffing issues if you feel
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
that it is justifiable to keep a human
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
being locked up behind bars taking years
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
of their life away from them affecting
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
their families communities without the
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
what may reason to the member rise
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
when our colleagues can only do a point
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
of order at this point okay opponent of
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
water then please what is your point of
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
voter when our colleague says the word
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
you is she speaking about all of us in
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
the room or is she talking to you
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
globally thank you for your question
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a question
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a question
 
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.550 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a question
i

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
honestly representative i am not sure
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
who she was addressing
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
i would assume the members
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the chamber right now
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
further point of
 
00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:56.470 align:start position:0%
further point of
water

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me that she's painting her
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the criminal justice
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee in an unfavorable light is is
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
that what it sounds like to you
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
point of order mr speaker i'm feeling
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
insinuated wait wait
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%

i i cannot
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
only a point of order right now
 
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
only a point of order right now
representative

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
a question does not stop another member
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
in debate i'm sorry
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
was that permission a question yeah is
 
00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
was that permission a question yeah is
is

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
the question that i have is
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
the word you is often a rhetorical
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh is it not possible that we all every
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
single one of us use you as a rhetorical
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
device regularly in this chamber without
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
being interrupted in our speech
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
the member may continue
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you feel that it is justifiable to
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
keep a human being locked up behind bars
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
taking years of their life away from
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
them affecting their families and
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
communities without the right to fair
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
due process because we need to hire more
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
people than fine kill this bill but if
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
you think that not having enough parole
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
members is an egregious excuse to keep
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
people incarcerated and affects the
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
fairness of our justice system and that
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
it is not the responsibility nor the
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
fault of someone that is behind bars for

thank you mr speaker
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee having

heard testimony from the parole board
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
the aclu and various witnesses
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
actually it came down that it was a
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue and we agree that some
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
change is necessary
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
what my colleague previously said
 
00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.230 align:start position:0%
what my colleague previously said
regarding

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
safety in the country and the reason we
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
have these sentencing laws
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
is the reason that new hampshire is the
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
safest state in the country
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
having said that we do agree that some
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
work is needed to be done on the
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
sentencing laws however the other side's
 
00:50:04.559 --> 00:50:05.829 align:start position:0%
sentencing laws however the other side's
proposal

00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
of 50 percent
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
only having to serve 50
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the minimum sentence
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
was way beyond what we were willing to
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
work for
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
i feel that much work is done needed to
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
be done on this issue
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to the comments repeatedly
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
made about due process
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
due process was granted at a trial where
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
they were judged by a jury of their
 
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.349 align:start position:0%
they were judged by a jury of their
peers

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
peers
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
all inmates
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
unless we the legislature
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
set a process for them to follow due
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
process has been followed

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire is the only state
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
where inmates must serve 100 percent
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
of their minimum sentence
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that the new
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire prison population increased
 
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
hampshire prison population increased
tenfold

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
tenfold
 
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.390 align:start position:0%
tenfold
tenfold

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
tenfold
 
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.270 align:start position:0%
tenfold
since

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
the truth and sentencing law took effect
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the early 1980s
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that hb
 
00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:57.270 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that hb
598

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
598
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
would give inmates a real incentive
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
to improve their lives in prison to
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate themselves so that they
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
could qualify for parole
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%

if i know that hb 598
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
would retroactively reduce sentences
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
sentences that were part of a plea
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%

crimes blessing
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
injustice to victims of violent crimes
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%

yesterday that this body is in favor of

strips out those needless regulations it
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
is a straightforward common sense bill
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
to treat adults like adults there is no
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%

pretty well this is a clear simple bill
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
it would legalize cannabis for adults 21
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
and older and it's essentially a
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
possession bill
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%

i rise in support of the committee's
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation of interim study
 
01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:21.910 align:start position:0%
recommendation of interim study
and

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why i believe this bill
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
will benefit from further studying by
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
the committee is that as i said several
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
times yesterday and i'll repeat myself
 
01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.029 align:start position:0%
times yesterday and i'll repeat myself
today

01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
that there are several bills that bills
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
that even have not even had a public
 
01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.829 align:start position:0%
that even have not even had a public
hearing

01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
hearing
that

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
involve issues related to cannabis
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
including restrictions on the the
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
possession limits
 
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
possession limits
and

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
there needs to be unification amongst
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
those policies uh if we were to pass
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
this bill we would be passing several
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
bills that all have a different
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
possession amount
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
and we need to be unified on that on
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
this subject if we're going to put
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
anything forward
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
my colleague who just spoke is a
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill that we have and
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
we have right now in the committee of
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice public safety
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee that we i believe
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
will pass this body i'm hoping it passes
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
with the veto proof majority as well
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
but in order for us to put forward the
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
best bill possible we cannot just keep
 
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
best bill possible we cannot just keep
passing

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
all these bills that have inconsistent
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
possession limits it creates confusion
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
amongst uh it would create confusion
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
amongst the public and it sends mixed
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
messages messages on the on the exact
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
policy we want to put forward
 
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:30.870 align:start position:0%
policy we want to put forward
so

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%

01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation this time for hb 632 this
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill would eliminate the sentence of
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
life without parole for juvenile
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
offenders life without parole is the
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
maximum sentence any judge could issue
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's reserved for the worst offenders
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
who commit the most awful violent
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
heinous crimes there's no disputing that
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no getting around that point
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
but we know the juvenile offenders are
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
different from adults
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
we know that human brains are still
 
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
we know that human brains are still
developing

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
and still maturing until we turn 25.
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
intense emotions impulse control anger
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
management these are things we learn as
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
we age
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
these are also factors that can
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
influence a child's thinking or lack
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
thereof before they commit a terrible
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's also worth considering the purpose
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
of prison within the criminal justice
 
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.550 align:start position:0%
of prison within the criminal justice
system

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes part of it is about punishment
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
but it is also about rehabilitation
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
for a juvenile sentenced to life without
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
parole there is no opportunity for
 
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.270 align:start position:0%
parole there is no opportunity for
rehabilitation

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
for a crime they committed as a child
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
this punishment says that the child is
 
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.709 align:start position:0%
this punishment says that the child is
irredeemable

01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
irredeemable
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
finally i will note that ending the
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
sentence of life without parole for
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
juvenile offenders does not guarantee
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
any offender will get out it only
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
guarantees they will have a chance at
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
some point to go before a parole board
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of change would not be
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking for our state 25 states
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
plus washington d.c have abolished this
 
01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.990 align:start position:0%
plus washington d.c have abolished this
sentence

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should join these states
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
and we can by overturning the committee
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation and passing this bill so
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
i would ask you again to overturn the
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee report so another motion could
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
be made thank you
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
back in c3
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes sir can i ask the representative a
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
question please does the member yield to
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%

01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr speaker thank you
 
01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:11.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr speaker thank you
representative

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
so if i understand this correctly a 15
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
or 16 year old who's
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
convicted of murder
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
could still face 20 or 25 years in jail
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's face it to a 15 year old is a
 
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
let's face it to a 15 year old is a
lifetime

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill would pass
 
01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:27.990 align:start position:0%
if this bill would pass
and

01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
it just made bans that they can't go
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
forever without parole is that correct
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative you addressed the
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative roy
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
to speak for the committee report
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
the committee after hearing testimony
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion that this bill
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
should be inexpedient to legislate
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
not well known is that life in prison
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
for juveniles mandatory life unlike for
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
adults is already illegal the united
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
supreme united states supreme court has
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
ruled that mandatory life for juveniles
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
is illegal and therefore it's not
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
imposed it is left up to a judge to
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
decide after hearing the facts weighing
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
the evidence
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
hearing from the victims and the
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
defendant to make the decision whether
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
or not to sentence a juvenile to life in
 
01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.709 align:start position:0%
or not to sentence a juvenile to life in
prison

01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
in making that decision the judge takes
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
into account the age of the offender
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
we cannot do that we cannot be at every
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
trial we cannot hear all the facts of
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
the trial we do not know the victims if
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
a juvenile 17 years old commits murder
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
and the judge finds the character of the
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
crime so heinous he may indeed sentence
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
into life without parole
 
01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.510 align:start position:0%
into life without parole
juveniles

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
juveniles
 
01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.870 align:start position:0%
juveniles
nowadays

01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
nowadays
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
many of them have extensive records by
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
the time they already become adults and
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
have proven themselves to be ill-fitted
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
for rehabilitation
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
another aspect
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice and besides
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
punishment and rehabilitation is
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
protecting the public protecting the
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
public from dangerous offenders
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
it has left the judge to decide
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
in his best left in in his hands or her
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
hands after hearing all the facts of
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
each case knowing whether or not someone
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
is worthy of rehabilitation or not
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to support the
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation of any
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and leave this in
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
the hands of the judiciary where it
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%

government is to protect individual

01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the number one issue i hear from my

very much madam speaker
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
if i know the fifth us circuit court of
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
appeals in new orleans got it right in
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
putting a hold on the vaccine mandate in
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
the workplace
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
if i further know that public interest
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
is best served by maintaining the
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
liberty of individuals to make their own
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
intensely intensely personal decisions
 
01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.590 align:start position:0%
intensely intensely personal decisions
however

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
if i also know this bill as amended has
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
created a constitutional conflict
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
between personal rights
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the rights of private business
 
01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.510 align:start position:0%

without what i then support this tabling
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
motion but know that a mandatory vaccine
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
work requirement is counterproductive to
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
is should hb 255 be laid upon the table
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%

months ago and it has already gone
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
well over budget
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that there is no
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
accountability for the education results
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
from this bill
 
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:45.430 align:start position:0%
from this bill
therefore

01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button and
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
table this legislation
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative ladd is recognized for
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry thank you very
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
much madam speaker
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
if i know there are some who oppose
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
local education freedom accounts as
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
proposed in 607
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
because of misinformation disseminated
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
by the education establishment
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
claiming that program diverts taxpayer
 
01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
money from the traditional public
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
schools but that is not reality because
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
this program will spend much much less
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
per pupil than average new hampshire
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
public school cost per student of twenty
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that hb 607 is enabling
 
01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
and if i know that hb 607 is enabling
legislation

01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
requiring a 60 percent super majority of
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%

01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
that can also be rescinded by a similar
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
action at any time
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
and if i believe educational opportunity
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
provided by a local education freedom
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
account is created first and foremost to
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
give parents the power to choose the
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%

learning that are best for their
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
children while public school education
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of education choice will

02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 87 would allow anyone other
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
than election officials to enter a
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
polling place where wearing clothing or
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia that promotes a candidate
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
party ballot question
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
and stay inside the polling place for as
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
long as they want to
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
the majority report argues that new
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire election electioneering laws
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
should be repealed
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
because a minnesota election hearing law
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
was struck down by the supreme court
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
well the supreme court did not say that
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
states could not prohibit campaign
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
displays inside polling places
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
they said that quote
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
minnesota has not supported its good
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
intentions with a law capable of
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
reasoned application
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
the court went on to credit the states
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
of texas and california for having
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
electioneering laws that prohibit the
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
the house needs to come to order please
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
take your conversations outside i can
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
hardly hear him speaking
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam speaker
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
the court credited the states of texas
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
and california for having electioneering
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
laws that prohibited campaign clothing
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
and paraphernalia
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
they did so in what the court called
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
more lucid terms
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
and indicated that those laws could be
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
consistently interpreted and enforced
 
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
like the laws in california and texas
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's election hearing laws
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
are detailed clear and can be
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
consistently applied
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
so what could happen if this bill passes
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
other than election officials anyone
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
wearing campaign materials can gather
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
loiter congregate inside the polling
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
place stay there for as long as they
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
want there's no restrictions as to
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not these people can be
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
from the town from the ward from the
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
city from the voting district they can
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
come in from anywhere and stay as long
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
as they want
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
some polling sites are located in school
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
gymnasiums in nashua i know we have
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
several that are that way
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and our election officials will pull out
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
bleachers so that observers can sit
 
02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:54.470 align:start position:0%
bleachers so that observers can sit
comfortably

02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
comfortably
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
and be out of the flow of voters and
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes candidates and
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
campaign workers can pack into those
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
bleachers and conduct pep rallies for
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
their issues or their candidates for as
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
long as they want to
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
some of our other polling sites are
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
quite small and have very limited space
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
for voting equipment voters and election
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
workers let alone for candidates and
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
campaigners who want to work the voters
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
inside the polls
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes candidates and
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
campaign workers can be anywhere in the
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
public area
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
there are no restrictions in this bill
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
and how close they can get to the voters
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
outside the building voters have a 10
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
foot wide safe passage corridor leading
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
to the entrance but once they're inside
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
the building that safe passage corridor
 
02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:39.510 align:start position:0%
the building that safe passage corridor
disappears

02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
disappears
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly candidates or campaign
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
workers from all major parties will try
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of this last minute
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity this is not party specific
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
and why wouldn't they why not have a
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
last-minute opportunity to influence
 
02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.069 align:start position:0%
last-minute opportunity to influence
voters

02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
so if you want to let's make a deal
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
crowd in the bleachers or a circus-like
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
atmosphere in the public areas of the
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
polling place then vote for the bill
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
but if you want to ensure safe and clear
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
paths for voters inside the polling
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
place and want to help our election
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
officials keep the polling places free
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
of obstructions for their work and for
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
voter traffic then please press the red
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%

the goal of our new hampshire house
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
majority has been simple this term
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're making it easier to vote and
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
harder to cheat
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
whether you wear a red hat house will be
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
in order

whether you're wearing a red hat a blue
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
shirt or a yellow scarf you should be
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote on election day we made
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
significant changes to this bill from
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
when it was introduced during committee
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that voters have the right to
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
vote in whatever appropriate clothing
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
item they're wearing
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
we've made sure to further refine our
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
existing law so that poll workers and
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
those that are working the polls on
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
behalf of the town or the state or the
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
challengers appointed by the party are
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
still prohibited from wearing political
 
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia this is to ensure that no
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
one can feel intimidation when they are
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
receiving their ballot or when they're
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
casting it
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
when someone who is registered to vote
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
gets to their polling location gets
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
their name crossed off the checklist and
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
is handed their ballot by the ballot
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
clerk that individual deserves to vote
 
02:10:44.639 --> 02:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
clerk that individual deserves to vote
period

02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let you all in on a little
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
trade secret
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
no one going to vote is undecided when
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
they get to the polling location
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
we all love to hold our signs outside
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
with our volunteers trying to convince
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
people last minute to vote for them but
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
when people are coming to the polling
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
location they already know how they're
 
02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:10.870 align:start position:0%
location they already know how they're
voting

02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would not impact that at all
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
just as signs placed along the roadway
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
have no impact on how somebody votes
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
allowing someone to wear a hat or a
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
t-shirt into the polling location would
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
have no further impact on that right to
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
vote or how that individual voter will
 
02:11:34.079 --> 02:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
vote or how that individual voter will
vote

02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
the supreme court as was mentioned
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
struck down in 2018 a minnesota law that
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited voters from wearing t-shirts
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
hats and buttons expressing political
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
views at polling places we should follow
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
that precedent and reform our laws
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%

02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the majority report of ought to pass as
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
amended on hb 87 representative bergeron
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a parliamentary
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you madam speaker
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
if i know that the minnesota election
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
hearing law struck down by the supreme
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
court was vague subject to conflicting
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
interpretations and generally
 
02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:33.189 align:start position:0%
interpretations and generally
unenforceable

02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know that new hampshire's
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
electioneering laws are similar to other
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
states laws that the supreme court
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
called lucid and they could be equitably
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
applied and enforced
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill does not
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
apply only to voters as they are in the
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
act of casting ballots
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
and if i know that allowing anyone and
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
any number of people for any length of
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
time to loiter gather congregate
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
campaign or disrupt the peace inside a
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
would be disrespectful toward our voters
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
and our election officials would i then
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
press the red no button so the
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%

02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
our fundamental right to vote is sacred
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
and if i know we should be removing as
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
many unnecessary prohibitions on us
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%

bergeron to speak against the committee
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
report thank you mr speaker
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 514 pertains to the issue of
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
rotating the parties and names of
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
this process
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
is a result of what's called the primacy
 
02:20:31.359 --> 02:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
is a result of what's called the primacy
effect

02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
which refers to the advantage that a
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
party or candidate receives based on
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
their ballot position
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
state law now requires the secretary of
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
state to rotate party columns and
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
candidate positions
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
the majority report states that the bill
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
will allow the secretary of state to
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
increase the range of deviation for
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
ballot rotations from one to two percent
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's not correct
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
the current law states that the average
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
deviation quote shall be as close to 0
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
as practicable
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
in testimony before the committee the
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office said it
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
would be easier for them to design
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
ballots if the allowable deviation was
 
02:21:10.399 --> 02:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
ballots if the allowable deviation was
increased

02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
easier and less complicated
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
this new hampshire supreme court
 
02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
considered a case relative to primacy
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
effects back in 2006
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
and during testimony before the court
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state said quote the
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
primacy effect can confer as much as a
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
six to ten percent advantage upon
 
02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:30.710 align:start position:0%
six to ten percent advantage upon
candidates

02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
and in its final decision the court
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
found that the primacy effect does quote
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
confer an advantage in elections
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the court also affirmed new
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire's constitutionally guaranteed
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
equal right to be elected
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately the rights and interests of
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
voters and candidates deserve greater
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
consideration and support than the wish
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the secretary of state for an easier
 
02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
less complicated process
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
probably everyone in this room has
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
either been involved in a recount or
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
known someone who has been involved in a
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
recount due to a very close election
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
the primacy effect does confer an
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
advantage in elections
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
current law says that the average
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
deviation shall be as close to zero
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
percent as practicable
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
let's ensure that voters have the final
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
say in who gets elected not ballot
 
02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
say in who gets elected not ballot
position

02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
please press the red no button when the
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you mr
 
02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you mr
speaker

02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
hb 514 addresses the method for
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
determining the column rotation on
 
02:22:45.439 --> 02:22:46.469 align:start position:0%
determining the column rotation on
ballots

02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
the bill originally proposed an
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
open-ended change to the formula
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as now amended proposes that
 
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
the formula used can have a deviation up
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
to two percent rather than the current
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office is
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for preparation of ballots
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
while we are more familiar with the
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
process for the order of the candidate's
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
name there is also a process for the
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
order of the columns that are by party
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
every 10 years after the census and
 
02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
every 10 years after the census and
redistricting

02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
the rotation order for the party of the
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
column is recalculated this work is done
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state's office
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
currently the law provides that the
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
order for rotations on the ballots will
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
be figured based on the smallest
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative districts the districts
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
you and i run in
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
and then there needs to be a balance of
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
those representative districts within
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
each of the 24 districts
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
but those people on the other side of
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the wall so to speak
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
when that calculation is done the
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
average deviation across the state for
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
an equal rotation
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
for being in the first column must be no
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
greater than one percent
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
the latest rotation in effect resulted
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
in 1.17
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
average deviation from equal rotation
 
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.750 align:start position:0%
average deviation from equal rotation
statewide

02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
this formula went into effect after the
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
2010 census
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
in the previous decade there had been
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
court cases on the method used
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
the court ruled that the previous
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
methods used to prepare ballot rotations
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
were not enough to ensure that the right
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
to be elected a unique new hampshire
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
right was protected
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
so the state went from simply having the
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
first column assigned to the party that
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
won the previous election
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
to a random rotation
 
02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
because our law rsa
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
6565 sets the highest priority on house
 
02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
6565 sets the highest priority on house
districts

02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
then moves to the senate the initial
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
work is necessarily largely manual since
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
there is a striking lack of uniformity
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
in these districts
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
in a state election the secretary of
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
state produces over one thousand
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
different ballots for 310 polling places
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and yukaba ballots
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
the present formula that the secretary
 
02:25:11.270 --> 02:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
of state's office must follow
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
working from house districts requires
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
much of the initial work to be done
 
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
much of the initial work to be done
manually

02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
manually
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
by increasing the upper limit from one
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
to two percent it is believed it will
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
not statistically impact any primary
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
effect and be able to cover the governor
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
the executive council federal offices
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
state and senate etcetera
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
no other state has this complexity
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation is being introduced to
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
continue continue the randomized ballot
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
rotation in a manner that protects the
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
right to be elected while providing a
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
less burdensome way to do it
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
not just to make the secretary of
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
state's office job easier
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of the election law
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee agreed with the request being
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable and i ask for your support of
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of ought to pass with
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
the question before us is
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
on house bill 514 the majority report of
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
octopass has amended mr speaker
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm at a3
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
over here yes
 
02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
um i have a point of order is
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay that that was we will clarify that
 
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
that was a request by one member from
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
another member but no it is not allowed
 
02:26:54.399 --> 02:26:55.270 align:start position:0%
another member but no it is not allowed
so

02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
all members take that to uh to heart and
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
it is not allowed
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm excuse me mr speaker follow up if
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
i may yes what is following um so if a
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
member is allowed to videotape upon
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
request the member is not allowed
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
even with a request that is correct that
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
is correct okay thank you they were
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
question is on house bill 514 the
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
majority report of arthur pass has
 
02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.270 align:start position:0%
majority report of arthur pass has
amended

02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
who's requested the roll call
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative barbara representative
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
barbara griffin has requested roll calls
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's officially seconded it is
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
vote members take your seats this will
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
i also come to water
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
if i know that the supreme court has
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
determined that the primacy effect
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
influences even to a small degree the
 
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
outcome of new hampshire elections
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the new hampshire
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court has cited new hampshire's
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
constitutionally guaranteed equal right
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be elected
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
and if i know under the current law that
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
there is no current upper limit for the
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
range of deviation pertaining to ballot
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
rotation it only requires that the
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
secretary of state get as close to zero
 
02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
percent as possible
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the rights and
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
interests of voters and candidates
 
02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
deserve greater consideration than the
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
state department's wishes for an easier
 
02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
and less complicated process to
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
implement an existing law would i then
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
press the red no button so that a
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent motion can be made
 
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know the
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
statutory formula for party column
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
rotation is complex and subjective and
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
cannot be easily explained
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
if i know that our new england sister
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
states and other states with election
 
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
day registration like minnesota and
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
wyoming have a far simpler rotation that
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
can be easily explained
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i know that the formula to do this
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
used by new hampshire is one of the most
 
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
complicated in the country
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
requesting balancing among
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
representatives and within senate
 
02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:24.309 align:start position:0%
representatives and within senate
districts

02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:30:26.309 --> 02:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill as amended
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
does not change the formula rotation but
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
allows a slightly higher deviation which
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
will not have an adverse effect on our
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights to be elected
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button and
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%

02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
remember may continue
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
i was done i just
 
02:46:41.439 --> 02:46:42.150 align:start position:0%
i was done i just

02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
i hope that people heard me i encouraged
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
the um body to vote against the otpa
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
because rsa 45
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
already addresses our ability to
 
02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:56.870 align:start position:0%
already addresses our ability to
terminate

02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
02:46:58.469 --> 02:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
executive orders by concurrent
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
resolutions thank you mr speaker
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative leakes to speak for the
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
committee report thank you mr chair
 
02:47:11.349 --> 02:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
when an emergency strikes the governor
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
needs the power to deal with the
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
situation promptly
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
this bill permits the governor to
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency for up to
 
02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
21 days he can then renew that state of
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
emergency up to three times for up to 21
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
days each
 
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
this permits the governor to maintain
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
his emergency powers for up to 84 days
 
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
without requiring the legislature to
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
meet emergencies have more than one
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
phase there is the initial phase which
 
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
requires quick and decisive action which
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
the governor is better suited to than
 
02:47:44.309 --> 02:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
however after the immediate problems
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
have been dealt with the emergency
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
transitions to a management phase where
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
there may be still serious problems that
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
may last for a long time
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
but the situation does not require the
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
same level of urgent response as the
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
initial phase
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
after the initial phase the people of
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire need to be involved in the
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
process through their legislators
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
if the legislature believes that the
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
state of emergency should last beyond 84
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
days it may vote to renew it for up to
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
90 days at a time and can renew it as
 
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
often as needed
 
02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
even during i mean concern has been
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
raised that there may be a need to
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
extend the state of emergency but it
 
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
might not be possible for the
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to meet even during the
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
recent emergency the legislature was
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
able to meet in less than that amount of
 
02:48:34.479 --> 02:48:35.429 align:start position:0%
able to meet in less than that amount of
time

02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have shown that we have the
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
creativity and flexibility to meet and
 
02:48:41.269 --> 02:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
do our duty even under difficult
 
02:48:41.279 --> 02:48:43.190 align:start position:0%
do our duty even under difficult
circumstances

02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
while the current statute permits the
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
legislature to meet and vote to end a
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
state of emergency there is a
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
significant difference between the
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
legislature having the power to meet to
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
end a state of emergency and it being
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
required to meet to extend one
 
02:48:59.349 --> 02:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
meeting and voting to extend the state
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
of emergency makes it clear to our
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
constituents that we are doing our job
 
02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
sitting on our hands and leaving the
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the governor
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
part 1 article 37 of our constitution
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
states in part
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the government of this state the
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
three essential powers thereof to it the
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
legislative executive and judicial ought
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
to be kept as separate from and
 
02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
independent of each other as the nature
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
of a free government will admit
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency is a truly
 
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
extraordinary thing
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
it is the suspension of this
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
constitutionally mandated separation of
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
powers well that may be necessary to
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
respond quickly to an emergency
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
after some point in time it is no longer
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
justified and the legislature must
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
resume its constitutionally mandated
 
02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
task of guiding the way any remaining
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
problems created by the emergency are
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
managed that must be an active role not
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
just standing aside and acquiescing to
 
02:50:00.309 --> 02:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the governor chooses to do
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
also if the state of emergency does need
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
to extend beyond 84 days the legislature
 
02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
should have the governor's back an
 
02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
actively declared support of how the
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
emergency is being handled if there is
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to the state of emergency we
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
should share in the blame or credit of
 
02:50:19.349 --> 02:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
extending it that is our responsibility
 
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
as representatives of our constituents
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislature affects the future this bill
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
is not a referendum on how the recent
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
state of emergency was handled
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
even if we believe that the current
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
governor handled the recent emergency
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
perfectly we need to consider the
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
possibility that a future governor may
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
respond in a less appropriate manner
 
02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:41.520 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know there is a
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
long-standing american tradition of
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
considering a person's home their castle
 
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
and that this is reflected in the
 
02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
constitution law and tradition
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that following that
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
tradition the final decision on leaving
 
02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
one's home must be up to the homeowner
 
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
even in a state of emergency
 
02:58:58.230 --> 02:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
and further if i know that this bill
 
02:59:00.550 --> 02:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
relieves first responders of any
 
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to assist someone who refuses
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
to evacuate under a state of emergency
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
lastly if i know that current practice
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
is to inform people that they should
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
evacuate but not compel them to do so
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
would i press red to oppose the
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
committee amendment of the committee
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
motion so another motion may be made
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the representative
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
goalie for a parliamentary inquiry
 
02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker over here a1
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the purpose of
 
02:59:32.309 --> 02:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
emergency evacuation orders is to
 
02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
provide for safety of the public and
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know this bill would
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement of individuals to
 
02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
evacuate during an emergency
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know this would
 
02:59:47.429 --> 02:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
create both a safety and liability issue
 
02:59:49.590 --> 02:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
for our first responders as there is
 
02:59:50.950 --> 02:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
nothing that prevents someone who has
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
chosen not to evacuate to later call for
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
help as the emergency situation
 
02:59:55.359 --> 02:59:56.630 align:start position:0%
help as the emergency situation
escalates

02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
escalates
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know there is no way
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
to keep record of those who have chosen
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
to disregard the emergency evacuation
 
03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:03.110 align:start position:0%
to disregard the emergency evacuation
order

03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
order
 
03:00:04.630 --> 03:00:04.640 align:start position:0%

03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
child to sysc when the judge believes
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances require this type of
 
03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:17.349 align:start position:0%
circumstances require this type of
intervention

03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
03:05:17.359 --> 03:05:18.389 align:start position:0%
intervention
currently

03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
a child must commit three separate
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
crimes if they do not meet conditions
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
for commitment
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
we believe the amended judicial
 
03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
discretion is more robust and provides
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the child and
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
the public safety
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is unchanged from
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
the policy endorsed by the children and
 
03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
family law committee and unanimously
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
supported by this house
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
it is important to remember that
 
03:05:47.590 --> 03:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
children in the juvenile justice system
 
03:05:50.710 --> 03:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
are released from sysc and the system at
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
18 years of age the goal of the juvenile
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
justice system is to prepare the child
 
03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
to be a productive adult member of the
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire community
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
the last time this legislature changed
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
sysc commitment standards the sysc
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
census was nearly 70 children on average
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of these kids were
 
03:06:17.830 --> 03:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
recommitted to sysc after release
 
03:06:20.309 --> 03:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
that is just over six
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
of every 10 children committed
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
are released and then recommitted of the
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
nearly 70 children in 2017
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
46 of these children were weak
 
03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:33.429 align:start position:0%
46 of these children were weak
recommitted

03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
recommitted
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the changes eliminated most
 
03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors from commitment
 
03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
many people objected to the changes
 
03:06:43.269 --> 03:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
some people were afraid of these
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
children and others were concerned there
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
was a lack of available treatment
 
03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
i was one of those people objecting
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't believe that i did not believe
 
03:06:56.150 --> 03:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire was prepared for the
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
change and wanted a smaller change
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
after passage of the bill the census
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
dropped quickly the census dropped from
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
nearly 70 children in 2017
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
to about 12 children today
 
03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
as importantly there has been no
 
03:07:17.349 --> 03:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
widespread lack of service for these
 
03:07:17.359 --> 03:07:18.389 align:start position:0%
widespread lack of service for these
children

03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
in fact our service delivery system has
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
expanded significantly
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
in part to deal with the children no
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
longer at sysc
 
03:07:29.190 --> 03:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
as my friend from
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the 12 children at sysc today half or
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
more are incarcerated at sysc for
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offenses based on dcyf data
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
adults generally are not incarcerated
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
for misdemeanor offenses so why are we
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
locking up our children
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
in fact there are more beneficial
 
03:07:59.349 --> 03:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
services available for children rather
 
03:08:01.590 --> 03:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
than incarceration
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
however this bill will continue to
 
03:08:06.389 --> 03:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerate children who commit serious
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
violent offenses
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
it also give judges to stress discretion
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
as mentioned previously to incarcerate
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
the child for other offenses when that
 
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
is the only option to assure safety
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
the remaining children will be treated
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
in the existing children's system of
 
03:08:23.439 --> 03:08:24.710 align:start position:0%
in the existing children's system of
care

03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
dcyf indicates that 75 percent of all
 
03:08:30.790 --> 03:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
children incarcerated at syfc have a
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
behavioral health issue
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
the system of care is created to address
 
03:08:37.590 --> 03:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health needs
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
the system of care is the least
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
expensive and most effective way to
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
treat our children
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
our juvenile justice system has two
 
03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
our juvenile justice system has two
goals

03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
goals
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
one to protect the public
 
03:08:51.750 --> 03:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
and two to prepare children to be
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
productive adults
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
hb 254 accomplishes these goals by
 
03:09:00.070 --> 03:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerating serious violent offenders
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
and providing
 
03:09:04.630 --> 03:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
residential treatment for other children
 
03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
please please reaffirm the unanimous
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
house vote the unanimous finance
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
committee vote and the 18-1 vote of the
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee hb 254
 
03:09:18.230 --> 03:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
is the best way to treat our children
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
and deserves our support
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative lynn
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
to speak against the committee report
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen i have to offer my
 
03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:36.550 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen i have to offer my
apology

03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
apology
 
03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
it was recognized that there was a 21-0
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
vote of the finance committee in favor
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
i was one of those 21 folks
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
when this first came before finance i
 
03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
saw the problem that i'm well i will
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
talk to you about in a moment and i had
 
03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
to frankly swallow hard to to vote for
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
however the recent rash of property
 
03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
crimes around the country including
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
shoplifting and smashing grabs
 
03:10:14.229 --> 03:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
including some that have happened very
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
recently as within two weeks before
 
03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
recently as within two weeks before
christmas

03:10:17.110 --> 03:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
christmas
 
03:10:18.630 --> 03:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
have led me to change my mind and to
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
would represent bad public policy and
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
should not be enacted
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
under present law
 
03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
a juvenile cannot be committed to a
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
juvenile detention facility for any
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
theft crime
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
false statement or false swearing crime
 
03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
or breach of the peace types type crime
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
if such crimes would be a misdemeanor if
 
03:10:46.710 --> 03:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
committed by an adult
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
but there is a so-called three strikes
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
exception and it's important to
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand that what that exception does
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
is to allow
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
but not require a minor to be committed
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the types of offenses
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that i just spoke about
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
if he or she has been found delinquent
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
of three past offenses
 
03:11:11.429 --> 03:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
hb 254 significantly expands
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
the crimes for which a minor can never
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
be committed to include essentially all
 
03:11:19.269 --> 03:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
non-violent crimes
 
03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
even if they are felonies
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
of particular concern in what in light
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
of what's been happening around the
 
03:11:25.279 --> 03:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
of what's been happening around the
country

03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits commitment of minors
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
for property offenses
 
03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
no matter how much property is stolen or
 
03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
damaged unless the miner is either armed
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
with a weapon or there is a threat of or
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
actual infliction of bodily injury
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:11:47.190 --> 03:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
under the bill if you and your spouse go
 
03:11:48.790 --> 03:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
away for the weekend
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
and return to find that while you're
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
going while you were gone your house was
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
broken into by a minor and you are
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
literally cleaned out of thousands of
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of property
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
the miner doesn't have to worry
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
about spending even one day
 
03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
in juvenile detention
 
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
although i
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
am clear that the message that this bill
 
03:12:12.309 --> 03:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
sends the message
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
that property rights are not important
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that if all you do is steal
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
someone's property it's no big deal
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
although i'm sure this was not intended
 
03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
by by the committees that that
 
03:12:25.990 --> 03:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
considered this
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the kind of message
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
that the woke district attorneys have
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
been sending around the country in
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
places like los angeles
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
san francisco and philadelphia
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we have seen the consequences of
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
their policies
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
please do or not allow this folly in new
 
03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:46.389 align:start position:0%
please do or not allow this folly in new
hampshire

03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
amendment 2162h
 
03:12:51.429 --> 03:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
as we've just passed
 
03:12:53.910 --> 03:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
makes this bill even worse
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
because it eliminates the three the
 
03:12:57.990 --> 03:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
three strikes provision
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
so that under this amendment in the
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
example that i just gave the juvenile
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
would not have to worry about spending
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
even one day in juvenile commitment
 
03:13:09.190 --> 03:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
even if he had done and been convicted
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
of doing the exact same thing
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
three times previously it's important to
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
note that although the amendment
 
03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
contained adds a new section m
 
03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the statute
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
which allows the commitment of a minor
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
for any felony offense
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
but but it applies only if the miner
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
only if the court finds that the minor
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
poses a substantial risk to the public
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
of causing serious bodily injuries so
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
once again
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
this this amendment even with subsection
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
m does not change the message
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
that if you are only a property offender
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
um it's no big deal and you don't have
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
to worry about
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
spending even one day in commitment
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
i i have to emphasize here
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
i am the last person who takes the view
 
03:14:03.190 --> 03:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
that you know the way we should deal
 
03:14:05.349 --> 03:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
with juveniles is lock them up and throw
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
away the key
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
i absolutely believe
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
that incarceration commitment of a of a
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
minor should be the last possible thing
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
that happens and is is a very rare
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
situation that it should happen in a
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
property offense only
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
but that is that system of making it the
 
03:14:27.359 --> 03:14:28.229 align:start position:0%
but that is that system of making it the
last

03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
the last possible choice already exists
 
03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
under under present law
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
the judge has can can only employ impose
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
commitment as a last resort
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
have to make fines of fact
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
find by clear and convincing evidence
 
03:14:44.790 --> 03:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing left that would be
 
03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:46.389 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing left that would be
appropriate

03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
but this bill by saying never
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
never can a judge find out if it's a
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
property crime only just goes too far
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
one final point i would make and then
 
03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'll shut up
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
removing the possibility of commitment
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
reduces incentives for minors to become
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
invested in other dispositions that with
 
03:15:11.110 --> 03:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
other less severe dispositions which may
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
very well be appropriate in most cases
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is simply a reflection of the
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
carrot and the stick phenomenon
 
03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are some miners who are resistant
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
to who do or who do not believe that
 
03:15:24.630 --> 03:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
they need treatment or rehabilitation
 
03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:25.750 align:start position:0%
they need treatment or rehabilitation
programs

03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
and unless they understand that if they
 
03:15:29.429 --> 03:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
don't comply
 
03:15:32.469 --> 03:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
with a less onerous form of disposition
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
such as treatment counseling therapy
 
03:15:35.439 --> 03:15:37.670 align:start position:0%
such as treatment counseling therapy
whatever

03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
unless they unless they understand that
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
if they don't comply with that the judge
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
can use the stick of commitment
 
03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
the incentive to successfully complete
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
treatment programs just won't be there
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
for some for some juveniles in short
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen i believe that this
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
proposal is a solution in search of a
 
03:15:57.680 --> 03:15:58.710 align:start position:0%
proposal is a solution in search of a
problem

03:15:58.710 --> 03:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:16:01.590 --> 03:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
current law in this area is fine and i
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
urge you to press the get the red button
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
to vote no so that another motion may be
 
03:16:08.630 --> 03:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
made thank you mr speaker does the
 
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
member yield to questions
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
i do mr speaker representative edwards
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
he still has the floor right now
 
03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:22.309 align:start position:0%
he still has the floor right now
representative

03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
he's yielded the questions we'll get to
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
i i think representative rice and
 
03:16:32.070 --> 03:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative lynn are the ones up for
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions at this point is that is that
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
not correct because i'm here
 
03:16:37.510 --> 03:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative lynn is up for questions
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
right now yes sir
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm not the one with the question
 
03:16:42.560 --> 03:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
i i'm not the one with the question
representative

03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:50.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
um

03:16:50.550 --> 03:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding from from what
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
you just said that in fact
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh the judges have less
 
03:16:58.399 --> 03:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
uh the judges have less
flexibility

03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
for what they see fit under this law and
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
they're prescribed to not commit
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
someone unless it is an offense that is
 
03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:11.190 align:start position:0%
someone unless it is an offense that is
listed

03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.990 --> 03:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct this bill
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
reduces judicial discretion and there's
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
just no reason to do it there's no
 
03:17:22.469 --> 03:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that judges are you
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
know willy-nilly
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh committing uh minors to to the to uh
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
juvenile commitment for property
 
03:17:33.269 --> 03:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
offenses i i would be frank i don't know
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
this but i would be frankly
 
03:17:37.910 --> 03:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
extremely surprised if there was anyone
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
in ydc
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
and a committed sentence for only a
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
non-property crime and that's as it
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
should be because it rarely if ever
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
happened but this would say it can never
 
03:17:51.910 --> 03:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
happen and as i said that just goes too
 
03:17:51.920 --> 03:17:53.429 align:start position:0%
happen and as i said that just goes too
far

03:17:53.429 --> 03:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
far
 
03:17:56.070 --> 03:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
remember yield to further questions
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
i do representative cody
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative i wave my question
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
senator bel desairo yeah mr speaker i
 
03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
was ready to vote for this but now i'd

03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the table house
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill 254
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
division has been requested roll call mr
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%

yes it is sufficiently seconded
 
03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:54.229 align:start position:0%
yes it is sufficiently seconded

produced better outcomes for children
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
than incarceration
 
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
to this end we haven't appropriated
 
03:25:14.790 --> 03:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%

for the public this is the best served
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
by incarceration of these children
 
03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.000 align:start position:0%

representative romney that has agreed to
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%

representative abrami

um there are numerous of us who really
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't know where this bill came from why
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
and we can't figure out how to vote so
 
03:48:11.189 --> 03:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
if you could just give us a real brief
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
overview of what this is about that'll
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
help us thank you very much
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you my friend from hudson
 
03:48:19.269 --> 03:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
03:48:22.110 --> 03:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
so this bill actually goes back to the
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
2019-2020 session
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
when vaping was all the rage we had to
 
03:48:28.150 --> 03:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
come up with how do we tax nicotine
 
03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
come up with how do we tax nicotine
based

03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
based
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
vaping products and then how do we
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
how do we license
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
vape shops
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
we just we took care of the the taxing
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
that in 2019 but when we got to the
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
to the licensing of vape shops in
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
committee we said well why don't we why
 
03:48:48.550 --> 03:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
don't we make the license the same as
 
03:48:50.309 --> 03:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
store retail stores that just sell
 
03:48:50.319 --> 03:48:52.790 align:start position:0%
store retail stores that just sell
cigarettes

03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
well we had a work session and the
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
liquor commission came back
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they said guess what we have a big
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
error in our statutes
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
places that only sell cigarettes
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
a good example would be a dollar store
 
03:49:11.189 --> 03:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
dollar stores only sell cigarettes but
 
03:49:13.030 --> 03:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
they don't sell beer and wine
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're only paying six dollars and you
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
say well how did that happen
 
03:49:20.150 --> 03:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
well years ago in this body we decided
 
03:49:22.469 --> 03:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
that for
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
retail stores that sell uh beer and uh
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
beer and liquor a beer in the wine
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they'll be an additional six
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
dollars only if they also sell
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
cigarettes on the license fee
 
03:49:33.439 --> 03:49:35.429 align:start position:0%
cigarettes on the license fee
so

03:49:35.429 --> 03:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:37.990 --> 03:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
so what happened that got interpreted to
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
for all stores that just sell cigarettes
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
only were being charged six dollars
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
which is an error and the liquor
 
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
commission told us it's a big error
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
so fine
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
we said
 
03:49:51.910 --> 03:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we should retain this bill so that
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
we can have a hearing because it
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
involved 174 stores
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
that were only paying six dollars for a
 
03:49:58.080 --> 03:49:59.590 align:start position:0%
that were only paying six dollars for a
cigarette

03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
cigarette
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to sell cigarette or tobacco
 
03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:03.510 align:start position:0%
the ability to sell cigarette or tobacco
products

03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
products
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
we had the hearing we wanted to make
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure we had a hearing so those 174
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
stores could have a say on this
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
we did have the hearing that fall and
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was really no complaints about it
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
by the way the vape shop folks
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
earlier on had no problem with the feed
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
that we had come up with
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
174 dollars
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
for one register goes up slightly if
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's more than one register in the
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
store that's the way the statutes work
 
03:50:28.479 --> 03:50:30.070 align:start position:0%
store that's the way the statutes work
so

03:50:30.070 --> 03:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
ways and means uh we passed it that fall
 
03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
down now we're into 20 because here we
 
03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
are at the same time we were last a
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
couple of terms ago to the terminal
 
03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
we were we were voting on retained bills
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
we voted
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the house
 
03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much overwhelmingly voted yes on
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
and guess what happened in march
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
something called covet
 
03:50:54.309 --> 03:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
and that bill got hung up in with all
 
03:50:55.750 --> 03:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of bills that the senate
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
never took up
 
03:50:59.910 --> 03:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
so it just died because the senate never
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
took the bill up
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i was volunteered by because it was
 
03:51:05.349 --> 03:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
pretty unanimous out of that
 
03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
2019 2020 ways and means committee we're
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
pretty anonymous that we should fix this
 
03:51:10.720 --> 03:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
pretty anonymous that we should fix this
problem

03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
so we we fixed it that those retail
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
stores pay
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
216 not to six dollars
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we had the hearing where the stores
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
were agreeing
 
03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:22.630 align:start position:0%
were agreeing
so

03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:26.309 align:start position:0%
so
so

03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
so the bill went to edna this last
 
03:51:29.439 --> 03:51:30.389 align:start position:0%
so the bill went to edna this last
winter

03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
winter
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
because actually edna is the committee
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
that deals with
 
03:51:33.600 --> 03:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
that deals with
licensing

03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
ways and means deals with
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
how much the fee should be
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
so e-dna passed it
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
on this floor we all voted for this bill
 
03:51:45.199 --> 03:51:46.710 align:start position:0%
on this floor we all voted for this bill
then

03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
because in that bill that i filed
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
so i was volunteered to file the bill
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission asked for two ftes
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
we put it in the bill
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
edna took the two ftes out
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
so it really didn't have to go to
 
03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:01.990 align:start position:0%
so it really didn't have to go to
finance

03:52:01.990 --> 03:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
finance
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
but it
 
03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
it went to finance anyway
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
but guess what so finance retained the
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill because they they had other bills
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
to worry about with the budget and
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
everything so they took it up this fall
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
they had a hearing
 
03:52:17.349 --> 03:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
they passed it overwhelmingly so that's
 
03:52:18.550 --> 03:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
the story
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
this bill passed three committees
 
03:52:23.189 --> 03:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
ways of means
 
03:52:23.199 --> 03:52:24.309 align:start position:0%
ways of means
finance

03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%

03:52:24.319 --> 03:52:25.510 align:start position:0%

03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
edna
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
it passed this floor twice once last
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
session once this session
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
and here we are please vote yes on the
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill i hope that answers your question
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh up here at yes
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative i just could i ask
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
one question remember yield to a
 
03:52:45.840 --> 03:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
one question remember yield to a
question

03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes isn't it true
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
that we have to obey
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:01.199 --> 03:53:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
rules

03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:03.590 align:start position:0%
rules
about

03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
cigarette selling for the federal
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
government and especially the
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
national tobacco settlement
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that costs money
 
03:53:18.150 --> 03:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
it costs a lot more than six dollars for
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
each visit
 
03:53:20.239 --> 03:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
each visit
to

03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
these stores that are paying six dollars
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
and that that is why we needed to change
 
03:53:28.239 --> 03:53:29.189 align:start position:0%
and that that is why we needed to change
that

03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
yep thank you thank you for the question
 
03:53:34.229 --> 03:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's all true
 
03:53:36.070 --> 03:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
i want to point out one thing first off
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
first you got to understand is that
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes to enforcement of our
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
liquor laws
 
03:53:42.150 --> 03:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's an enforcement division of the
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
local commission
 
03:53:45.670 --> 03:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
but to make things efficient
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission also oversees the
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
oversight of cigarettes
 
03:53:53.429 --> 03:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
so the same enforcement officers
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
look at both so when they go to a store
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the six dollars
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
only if they already have a a license to
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
sell beer and wine it doesn't take that
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
much more as they go into a store
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that also has cigarettes
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
but to go to a store to oh to look
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
to to check his stuff he can't get very
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
far with six dollars
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing is you got to understand
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
we have a tradition in this state
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we try to we use fees
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for things
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
we pay fees in this case for enforcement
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
of our local laws and our tobacco laws
 
03:54:28.880 --> 03:54:30.070 align:start position:0%
of our local laws and our tobacco laws
so

03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree that at six
 
03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to uh for 174 stores to go
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
and check if they're obeying our laws is
 
03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
a bit bit low so the 216 again
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
three committed three committees
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
two house votes
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
and nobody complaining from the retail
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
stores that are impacted or the vape
 
03:54:51.990 --> 03:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
shops so i think this is uh to me to me
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
was a housekeeping bill
 
03:55:00.150 --> 03:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.510 --> 03:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
has been called
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:06.450 align:start position:0%
 
division

03:55:06.450 --> 03:55:06.460 align:start position:0%

03:55:06.460 --> 03:55:37.590 align:start position:0%

fees fines and taxes
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%

tax collection by retail stores it is

the hunter to put his name on the camera
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%

make it so it's actually more easily
 
04:07:47.439 --> 04:07:48.950 align:start position:0%

sylvia for a parliamentary inquiry
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
if i know this bill is unnecessary
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
because medicaid participants already
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
have access to dental care if they
 
04:12:37.040 --> 04:12:39.269 align:start position:0%
have access to dental care if they
choose

04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
choose
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
and also be in order
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know this bill
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
creates expanded entitlements
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
with no sunset provision
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
and will expand costs over time
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker
 
04:12:59.590 --> 04:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
if i know the purported benefit of
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
future cost savings
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
is virtually impossible to measure
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
leaving taxpayers to pay for a program
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
whose benefits cannot be determined
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%

with with respect representative we have
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
been allowing for some latitude
 
04:13:45.990 --> 04:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
the representative will continue
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%

been characterized
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%

i'm at microphone d2
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is in fact unnecessary the
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
title of the bill is establishing a
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
dental benefit under the state medicaid
 
04:16:26.560 --> 04:16:28.389 align:start position:0%
dental benefit under the state medicaid
program

04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
and contrary to to protestations
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the contrary
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
in fact dental benefits are already
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
available to medicaid participants in
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire there are
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
three managed care organizations
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%

04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%

caritas
 
04:16:50.149 --> 04:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
offers dental benefits as part of its
 
04:16:50.159 --> 04:16:51.670 align:start position:0%
offers dental benefits as part of its
package

04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
package
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i can quote from their
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
materials adult members age 28 21 and
 
04:16:59.429 --> 04:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
older are covered for a range of dental
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
services including preventive services
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
cleanings diagnostic services exams and
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
x-rays restorative services fillings
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
and some periodontal services root
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
planing and scaling the new hampshire
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
currently covers extractions under a
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
separate program
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
so the fact is that medicaid
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
participants in new hampshire already
 
04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
have access to dental care
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
if they want it
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
what this plan would do
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be to extend benefits to people
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
who for whatever reason
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
have decided to go with one of the two
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
other mcos that do not provide dental
 
04:17:40.399 --> 04:17:43.030 align:start position:0%
other mcos that do not provide dental
benefits

04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
so this bill is unnecessary
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
this program will grow it will become
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
more expensive this is a new entitlement
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we need only to look to a history of
 
04:17:57.670 --> 04:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
other entitlements and their growth
 
04:17:57.680 --> 04:17:59.349 align:start position:0%
other entitlements and their growth
trajectory

04:17:59.349 --> 04:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
trajectory
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
the medicaid program when it was
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
established in 1965 was projected to
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
cost 238 million dollars in the first
 
04:18:09.269 --> 04:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
year at a federal level
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
actual costs were over four times that
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
at a billion dollars
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
if i take that 238 million dollar
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
estimate and i fast forward adjust for
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
inflation to 2019
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
then theoretically we should have had a
 
04:18:23.439 --> 04:18:24.389 align:start position:0%
then theoretically we should have had a
cost

04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:18:26.070 --> 04:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
of 1.9 billion dollars
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
actual federal outlays
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
were 380 billion dollars
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
so about 200 times
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
that estimate going back to uh to the
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
founding of the program
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
and although this is one example there
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
are many if you go looking for examples
 
04:18:53.309 --> 04:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
of programs that ended up costing
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
significantly more than they were
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
projected to cost there are plenty of
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
them out there
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
so this is one example and they're
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
federal numbers but it illustrates a
 
04:19:06.070 --> 04:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
common theme
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
estimates for entitlements including
 
04:19:10.149 --> 04:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid are historically
 
04:19:10.159 --> 04:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid are historically
wrong

04:19:11.110 --> 04:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
in fact they are historically very wrong
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
and they always seem to be wrong
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
in the same direction
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
benefits will grow under this program
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
in fact the language of the amendment is
 
04:19:25.279 --> 04:19:26.149 align:start position:0%
in fact the language of the amendment is
written

04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
to include
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
among other things behavior management
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and smoking cessation counseling
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%

so will this program expand in fact this
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill is an expansion of an entitlement
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
program with further expansion
 
04:19:47.110 --> 04:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
capabilities written in
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
this will be permanent
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
there is no sunset provision in this
 
04:19:50.800 --> 04:19:52.229 align:start position:0%
there is no sunset provision in this
bill

04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
once we do this we all know
 
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
that it is virtually impossible to
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
and why might we want to rescind it we
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
might want to rescind it if it's not
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
living up to its promises
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
that leads to my fourth point
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
there is not an adequate structure for
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
accountability in this bill
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
the bill does contain language that call
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the dhhs to present an annual report
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
which includes among other things
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
indicators of program effectiveness
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
well how are we defining program
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
effectiveness because the proponents of
 
04:20:29.830 --> 04:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
this bill have said that one of its key
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
selling points is that it's going to
 
04:20:31.680 --> 04:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
selling points is that it's going to
save

04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
save
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of money because people who are
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
getting adequate dental care down the
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
road are not going to have as many
 
04:20:39.269 --> 04:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits they're not going
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
to have as many hospital stays and
 
04:20:41.670 --> 04:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have as many
 
04:20:41.680 --> 04:20:44.149 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have as many
surgeries

04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
surgeries
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
i acknowledge that there is some truth
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
to that good dental hygiene does
 
04:20:51.030 --> 04:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
contribute to good health and could save
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
money down the road i question whether
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
it is as big a cost savings as the
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
would put forward
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
nobody has said what that number is
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
nor have they said how it would be
 
04:21:03.840 --> 04:21:05.189 align:start position:0%
nor have they said how it would be
measured

04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
measured
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
probably because it is virtually
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
impossible to measure
 
04:21:11.110 --> 04:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
all the costs that didn't happen because
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
so if one of the most important selling
 
04:21:21.750 --> 04:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
points of this bill if not the most
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
important selling point of this bill is
 
04:21:24.870 --> 04:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
something that is virtually impossible
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
to measure
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
then i question whether we can ever know
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
if this program
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
is effective and has achieved its
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
intended results
 
04:21:35.750 --> 04:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
so in summary this bill is not necessary
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid participants who want dental
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
care can already get it it will grow
 
04:21:43.110 --> 04:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
there is no sunset provision it will be
 
04:21:43.120 --> 04:21:44.149 align:start position:0%
there is no sunset provision it will be
permanent

04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
and it lacks an adequate accountability
 
04:21:46.560 --> 04:21:47.670 align:start position:0%
and it lacks an adequate accountability
structure

04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
structure
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
to assure taxpayers that is delivering
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the promises that its proponents have
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
touted so strongly i urge my colleagues
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
to press the red button
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and vote against the otpa recommendation
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
so that an alternate motion can be made
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i am asking for a roll
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
call vote does the member yield to
 
04:22:06.319 --> 04:22:08.309 align:start position:0%
call vote does the member yield to
questions

04:22:08.309 --> 04:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
i do not remember does not yield
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative mark
 
04:22:15.760 --> 04:22:17.349 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative mark

to speak in favor committee report
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
is a result of a lot of hard work
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
by a bipartisan subgroup of the health
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly affairs
 
04:22:33.680 --> 04:22:35.189 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly affairs
committee

04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
who considered the costs in some depth
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
and compared with what other states are
 
04:22:42.080 --> 04:22:43.030 align:start position:0%
and compared with what other states are
doing

04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of dental care including red
 
04:22:45.520 --> 04:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
in terms of dental care including red
states

04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
i charged them to produce
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
a bill that would not be a handout to
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
the greedy but a hand up to the truly
 
04:22:54.479 --> 04:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
the greedy but a hand up to the truly
needy

04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
needy
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
it would demand some accountability and
 
04:22:58.880 --> 04:23:00.870 align:start position:0%
it would demand some accountability and
co-responsibility

04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
co-responsibility
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
from those receiving our help
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
but would also recognize there are truly
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
needy people
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
who without are helping them obtain
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
preventative dental care
 
04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
will contract such dental problems as to
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
require very expensive care on the
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer's dime
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
i am part-time ceo of a medical center
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
in kingston
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
we regularly see people who have
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
deferred much too long the care they
 
04:23:30.159 --> 04:23:31.030 align:start position:0%
deferred much too long the care they
need

04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
with the result of their needing
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
expensive care
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
we often provide reduced cost care to
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
those people who cannot afford it
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
various plans notwithstanding
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
while we know there are people who try
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
to game us and we watch for that
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
most of us
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
most of those asking our help truly need
 
04:23:52.560 --> 04:23:53.269 align:start position:0%
most of those asking our help truly need
it

04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
and in this time of inflation
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
especially so
 
04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
but we as a small facility can only do
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
so much
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
and we recognize there are many more
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
people who need help
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
i believe our bipartisan work group did
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
their job well
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
and so we have before it's a bill that
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
provides a hand up and not a handout
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
that requires recipients of our help to
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
share in responsibility
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
and that will keep people from those
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
expensive expensive treatments that will
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
cost the taxpayers a lot of money
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
i asked the legislature to support this
 
04:24:37.990 --> 04:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill which had nearly unanimous
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
 
04:24:43.680 --> 04:24:45.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
questions

04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
member yields you may require
 
04:24:50.309 --> 04:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i i
 
04:24:51.670 --> 04:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're all voting with
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
absolute clarity there was a statement
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
that sounded like fact
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
by the other speaker who said that the
 
04:25:03.510 --> 04:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
adult dental medicaid benefit
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
already existed
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure my
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of that is is correct i is
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
it true
 
04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
that the one mco of the three that
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
provides it
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
does it strictly on a voluntary
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
charitable basis
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
and can change their policy at any time
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
because it is their charity and they're
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
spending the small 1.5 profit margin on
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
providing this uh charitable care is
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is that true
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
that is what our that is what our
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker will the member yield to a
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
further question

thank you mr speaker
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
if i knew that this bill is the result
 
04:27:43.110 --> 04:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
of a bipartisan work group
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
that worked long and hard to articulate
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
a balanced approach
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
and if i knew that preventative care
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
often forced stalls
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
far more expensive care down the road
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
and if i knew that this bill gives a
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
hand up not a handout
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
and if i knew that this bill required
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
and finally if i knew that this
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill as amended had near unanimous
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%

04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
would i not press the green button

uh a short time before this meeting was
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
that members who tested positive should
 
04:30:31.830 --> 04:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
remain home
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i have a follow-up question
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%

you would too
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%

04:32:25.990 --> 04:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
if there is somebody in this room that
 
04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
has tested positive
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%

you were feeling sick
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
or you had any reason to believe you
 
04:32:55.110 --> 04:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
would use them
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%

478 which makes san gobain
 
04:36:33.990 --> 04:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
paid for the damage that they have done
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
had san gobain followed what they had
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
previously done with other communities
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
such as sousa falls

litchfield have been fighting for
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
justice from this polluter since 2016.
 
04:36:54.390 --> 04:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
these communities are just asking

sangobain to do the right thing
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
and supply clean potable water

04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
in 2016 sangoman first self-reported
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the water in their plant had tested
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
positive for the cancer-causing

substance known as pfas
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
i would ask you mr speaker
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
how many companies test
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
the public drinking water for a
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%

04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that a company
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
that previously had contaminated

04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%

the town of merrimack and its citizens
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
created a citizen advocate group started

extensive research on these chemicals
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
and what they can do not only to the

human body
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%

it was obvious that without something

negotiating with san gobain on doing
something

04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
anything about the wells that they had
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
immediately polluted
 
04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
san gobain did finally agree
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
to filter the two wells that they had
 
04:41:23.120 --> 04:41:24.070 align:start position:0%
to filter the two wells that they had
agreed

04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
were inside the consent decree area but
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
they only agreed to fill to provide five
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
years worth of maintenance of filters in
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the filter media to treat the water
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
seeing that the half-life of these
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
chemicals is 100 years
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack and
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers that participate in the
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
merrimack village district are looking
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
at about 300 years or so for the water
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
to no longer to be required to be
 
04:41:50.638 --> 04:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
to no longer to be required to be
filtered

04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
filtered
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
this leads the merrimack ratepayer on
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
the hook
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the ongoing ongoing maintenance for
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
an issue that they were not responsible
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
for now going decades into the future
 
04:42:05.670 --> 04:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
conversely in relation to hoosick falls
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
the agreement that san gobain signed
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
with hoosick falls
 
04:42:12.310 --> 04:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
is that they will pay for filtration
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
which makes you ponder from me mr
 
04:42:19.110 --> 04:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
speaker looking back in 2016
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
what would cause san gobain to
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
self-report the polluted water
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
was it so knowing that if san gobain
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
acted in this in this manner they could
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
get a town in citizenry
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
who are now worrying about safe drinking
 
04:42:32.400 --> 04:42:33.270 align:start position:0%
who are now worrying about safe drinking
water

04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
to rush to judgment and panic just to
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
get things done
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would surmise they were
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
i urge my colleagues to override the
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation to itl
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
and to enter and permit a new motion of
 
04:42:49.680 --> 04:42:50.948 align:start position:0%
and to enter and permit a new motion of
octopass

04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
octopass
 
04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
the times of merrimack and bedford and
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
its citizens who draw water from the
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
merrimack village district deserve
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
nothing less than safe clean portable
 
04:43:01.830 --> 04:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water for years and generations
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
to come thank you mr speaker remember
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
yield the questions i'd be more than
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
is it true
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
that saint gobain
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
agreed to put
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
a filter
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
in their system
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
say so they would no longer pollute
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
and is it true
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
that they agreed to do this
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
and they did install the filter but it
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
came with a bypass
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
that went around the filter is all of
 
04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
that true
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker the short answer is no
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
the issue that my distinguished
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman is referring to is referring
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the return regenerative thermal
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
oxidizer which is the clean clean fast
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
going into the air is a specifically
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
different issue as it relates to
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up further question do you
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
remember yield to another question i'd
 
04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
be happy to i have a question
 
04:44:10.878 --> 04:44:12.310 align:start position:0%
be happy to i have a question
a1

04:44:12.310 --> 04:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
a1
 
04:44:14.948 --> 04:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
are they continuing
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
to put pfast
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
into the air
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
as long as the rto is working the answer
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
is no if the rto is not working the
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
answer would be yes
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
question question of the
 
04:44:34.638 --> 04:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
question question of the
a1

04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
a1
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
does the member yield a further question
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to mr speaker main guy
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the epa
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
is considering
 
04:44:46.000 --> 04:44:47.190 align:start position:0%
is considering
making

04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
lowering the standards even more to no
 
04:44:49.600 --> 04:44:50.708 align:start position:0%
lowering the standards even more to no
detect

04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
detect
 
04:44:53.590 --> 04:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
for pfoa and pfas
 
04:44:53.600 --> 04:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
for pfoa and pfas
yes

04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
i'm at 8-2
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh may i ask a question of the
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative does the member yield to
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
a further question for the distinguished
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
gentlelady yes
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
you may inquire thank you
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill is iit is if the itl fails
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
and another motion that it ought to pass
 
04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
is successful
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
would that discourage other polluters
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
from passing on the cost of cleanup
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers and other ratepayers i
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
would hope so
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative langley
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
to speak against committee report
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:45:48.868 --> 04:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
the environmental agreement addressing
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
the groundwater contamination between
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack new hampshire and
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
saint gomez is flawed
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
flawed because the groundwater
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
contamination described has spread and
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
it has continued long past the time
 
04:46:03.600 --> 04:46:04.628 align:start position:0%
it has continued long past the time
period

04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
oh my god
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
to think the initial agreement was valid
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
under such circumstances would need to
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
assume that the groundwater is static
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the p-fast in the soil has magically
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
stopped leaching
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
though it has manufacturing operations
 
04:46:33.990 --> 04:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
zinc domains contaminated groundwater
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
with toxic pfas
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
including the wells of the merrimack
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
municipal water provider merrimack
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
village district
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 478 would require saint gomez
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
to take full financial responsibility
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
for installing
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
and maintaining filtration systems for
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
two of the directly impacted mvd wells
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
and that would ensure the water meets
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire drinking water
 
04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
standards for pfas
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
currently mvd rate payers are bearing
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
the cost that should be the sole
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the polluter
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack's agreement with
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
saint germain
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
focused on the short term need of well
 
04:47:19.200 --> 04:47:20.708 align:start position:0%
focused on the short term need of well
contamination

04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
but remediation is now anticipated to be
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
longer term as pfas resists degradation
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
in the environment
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
pfas particles are bio-accumulative
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
with life's
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
half-lifes of up to nine years assuming
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
further contamination is does not occur
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
recently the department of health and
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
human services released a report that
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
cited higher than expected numbers of
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
merrimack residents suffered from kidney
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
and renal cancer
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has a moral
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to ensure polluters are held
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
responsible no matter how short-sighted

level mr speaker has risen

to really unacceptable levels you've
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
been very good about trying to keep it
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
down but it's gotten out of control
 
04:48:40.230 --> 04:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%

04:48:47.520 --> 04:48:49.110 align:start position:0%
for the last day and a half

04:48:49.110 --> 04:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
asked
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
that people respect
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
a member when they're speaking and i can
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
tell you that the noise level is coming
 
04:49:00.550 --> 04:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
from both sides not just one side
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many times i've got to
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
ask members to be respectful and keep
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
the noise limit down and i'll keep
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
trying but that's the best i can do
 
04:49:08.958 --> 04:49:11.110 align:start position:0%
trying but that's the best i can do

the chair calls representative mclean
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker i'm here
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the committee
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl on hb 478 which
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
requires that cinco bain performance
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
plastics pay for the remediation of
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
water in certain wells contaminated with
 
04:50:14.160 --> 04:50:15.430 align:start position:0%
water in certain wells contaminated with
pfas

04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee understood
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
why the people of merrimack would feel
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by the actions of saint gobain
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and they also agreed that the current
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
well maintenance agreement which ends in
 
04:50:27.280 --> 04:50:28.628 align:start position:0%
well maintenance agreement which ends in
2023

04:50:28.628 --> 04:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
may be inadequate in light of
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
information gained since the agreement
 
04:50:35.110 --> 04:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
was entered into however
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
the committee also felt that asking the
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to extend the agreement for
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
as long as treatment is necessary sets a
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
precedent that the legislature should
 
04:50:43.600 --> 04:50:45.830 align:start position:0%
precedent that the legislature should
avoid

04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
04:50:48.070 --> 04:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
past legislative proposals which
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
addressed clean up remediation
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring and other issues
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
related to pfas on a broad basis
 
04:50:59.830 --> 04:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to have the legislature
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
judgment in a specific case
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
the committee felt that this should be
 
04:51:06.550 --> 04:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
left to the courts
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
the courts could review any new
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
information there could be a discovery
 
04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
process on both sides could prevent data
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
to support their respective positions
 
04:51:17.590 --> 04:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
and a decision as to whether or not to
 
04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
modify the agreement could be brought
 
04:51:20.000 --> 04:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
modify the agreement could be brought
forward

04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
in light of all that they've had to
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
endure the people of merrimack are more
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
than justified in their desire to review
 
04:51:30.550 --> 04:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
the terms of the current agreement
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
are well positioned to do this kind of
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
work the legislature is not
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll join me in supporting the
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority position of itl on
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%

04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested is that
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%

so

04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%

so

04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
the question before us
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
motion of itl the majority emotion of
 
04:53:43.830 --> 04:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
itl on house bill 478 this is going to
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
be a roll call vote
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
mayville for a parliamentary inquiry
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
that i feel like erin brockovich
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know that several communities
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
and many taxpayers in hillsborough
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
county have been subject to the worst
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
drinking water pollution in the history
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
and unless we hold this company
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
accountable for their actions this
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
travis email what may well come
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
to another town and another county
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
and if i further know
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire taxpayers
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
will ultimately be subjected to a
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
horrendous financial impact due to a
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
private company willfully and
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
negligently polluting
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
and continuing to pollute our state's
 
04:54:39.920 --> 04:54:40.868 align:start position:0%
and continuing to pollute our state's
air

04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
air
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
soil and groundwater
 
04:54:45.990 --> 04:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
and lastly if i know
 
04:54:48.310 --> 04:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
that options for litigation have been
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
exhausted and we bring the case to the
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
general court of new hampshire with the
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of protecting our state
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
its communities and taxpayers our
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
children and our grandchildren
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
then mr speaker
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
would i press the red button to
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%

04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
about the people who are affected by the
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%

if
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
that there may be
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
good reason why people would feel that
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
or it wasn't a proper contract at the
 
04:56:03.600 --> 04:56:05.590 align:start position:0%
or it wasn't a proper contract at the
time

04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i know that the way contracts are
 
04:56:09.750 --> 04:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
normally voided
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
is by
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to court
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
when a contract is fraudulent or created
 
04:56:15.840 --> 04:56:16.948 align:start position:0%
when a contract is fraudulent or created
by

04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
mutual misrepresentation or mutual
 
04:56:19.600 --> 04:56:21.270 align:start position:0%
mutual misrepresentation or mutual
misunderstanding

04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
or it's simply unconscionable
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
but the remedy for avoiding a contract
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
is not typically going to the
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
legislature to avoid a contract which is
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
what this legislation effectively
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
attempts to do
 
04:56:36.628 --> 04:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
the remedy is ordinarily to go to court
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
to do that which i understand
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
is currently in progress
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i think i would ask if and i
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
04:56:47.040 --> 04:56:48.310 align:start position:0%
and if i know
that

04:56:48.310 --> 04:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of process the better approach
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
in this case as the majority of the
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee bipartisan majority of the
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee felt was to
 
04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
litigate this in court to determine
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not the contract was valid
 
04:57:02.080 --> 04:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
whether or not the contract was valid
before

04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature acting to avoid it
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
and if that was the case would i press
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%

the following resolution resolved that
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%

considered the same and being unable to
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
pass senator brian sullivan for the
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
state your point of order um
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%

i personally have no objection to
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
continuing with this one and then
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
05:11:19.350 --> 05:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
that a vote to table a good minimum wage
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
is a vote on behalf of the privileged
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
few and the high hats of society and not
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
the common everyday person
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
if i also be in order
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
if i know that time after time when
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
voters go to the polls where a minimum
 
05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
wage is on the ballot it is the most
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
popular item on the ballot even in
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
republican states like missouri and
 
05:11:38.480 --> 05:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
republican states like missouri and
florida

05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
florida
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
if i know that i agree with former
 
05:11:44.230 --> 05:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
president trump who on the campaign
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
trail in 2016 said quote the minimum
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
wage has to go up at least 10 federally
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
but it has to go up
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we can't find enough lnas or
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
grocery store clerks because we expect
 
05:12:00.070 --> 05:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
them to work for starvation wages and
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
oddly enough nobody likes that deal
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that the working poor who were
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
oh so thrilled to find themselves deemed
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
by governments as essential workers have
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
so far only received genuflected
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
facebook posts from the permanent
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
managerial class in the financial elite
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
instead of the raise they have more than
 
05:12:18.320 --> 05:12:20.788 align:start position:0%
instead of the raise they have more than
earned

05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
and if i know that opponents of a good
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
minimum wage say that it takes a
 
05:12:25.990 --> 05:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
person's or what takes away a person's
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
self-reliance but what really kills
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
someone's self-reliance is having to
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
work 60 hours a week for 7.25 eight
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%

and if i further know that an ad hoc
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee as some have suggested would
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
have no official standing no power or
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%

the city of concord received numerous

05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
there were so many complaints about
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
noise traffic and waste issues that the
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
city tried to address these issues
 
05:30:42.868 --> 05:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
through local regulations
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
this failed because although it is a
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
very shallow marsh the acreage of hoyt
 
05:30:49.830 --> 05:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
road marsh put it under state
 
05:30:49.840 --> 05:30:51.190 align:start position:0%

05:31:03.680 --> 05:31:04.948 align:start position:0%
come to us their legislature to find
solutions

05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
bill filing deadlines have passed so the
 
05:31:09.750 --> 05:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition of ohrvis on white road
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%

trailer bill in 2019
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
this bill was passed by the legislature
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
and signed by our current governor
 
05:31:22.628 --> 05:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
it has now been three winters since the
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
prohibition became law
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing the committee
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
heard from numerous neighbors thankful
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
that they could now enjoy peace in their
 
05:31:33.670 --> 05:31:33.680 align:start position:0%

05:31:33.680 --> 05:31:34.628 align:start position:0%

gone

05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
gone
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
we also heard that the repeal is needed
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
by those who want their children to be
 
05:31:40.548 --> 05:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
able to ride at high speeds on
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
motorcycles with studded tires on the
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
frozen marsh
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it isn't just the noise of the
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycles that the minority of the
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee residents and the people who
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
drive white road find problematic point
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
road is narrow and parking used to
 
05:31:58.150 --> 05:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
access the marsh is very limited just
 
05:32:00.390 --> 05:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
picture five to ten vehicles pulling
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
trailers with their motorcycles as well
 
05:32:05.030 --> 05:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
as cars of people who have come to enjoy
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
the spectacle
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
cramming into a small parking lot or
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
along the road add to that that there
 
05:32:13.350 --> 05:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
are no facilities there are no porta
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
potties no trash receptacles
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
not a pretty picture
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
i asked fish and game officials whose
 
05:32:19.520 --> 05:32:21.030 align:start position:0%
i asked fish and game officials whose
responsibility

05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
whose responsibility the marsh area is
 
05:32:26.948 --> 05:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
if the agency would be providing porta
 
05:32:30.070 --> 05:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
potties if the repeal is lifted no way
 
05:32:31.750 --> 05:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
that will be the responsibility of the
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
city of concord the city which has no
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
say in whether ice riding be allowed
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that there are
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
alternatives to white road marsh for ice
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
racing a number of ponds in concord and
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
the lakes region do allow it
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
turtle town pond only a couple of miles
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
from hoyt road marsh is one of them
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
folks who want to ice ride can easily
 
05:32:56.708 --> 05:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
travel there or to two or three other
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
ponds within 10 to 20 miles where ice
 
05:33:01.750 --> 05:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
racing is allowed
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
point road marsh is a valuable wetland
 
05:33:05.830 --> 05:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
and upland noted for diversity of
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
species both flora and fauna and there
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
are other options nearby so i ask you to
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
vote against repealing ohrv prohibition
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
by pushing the red button so that
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made and thank you
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you the member from hudson
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%

i'd rather speak to the folks out here i
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't wish to speak to the uh
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
you find my back
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
is it required to speak to the speaker
 
05:33:49.430 --> 05:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
or is it can i speak to the members
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
actually never speak to the body except
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
when they're answering a question i
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
believe so i know it's awkward all right
 
05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
well then i'll guess i will follow your
 
05:33:57.760 --> 05:34:03.030 align:start position:0%
well then i'll guess i will follow your
directions

05:34:03.030 --> 05:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
can you still hear me out there
 
05:34:05.520 --> 05:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
can you still hear me out there
okay

05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
let's start off with some basic facts mr

05:34:19.270 --> 05:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
liquid and ice is owned the water is
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
owned by the state
 
05:34:24.868 --> 05:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of all the people
 
05:34:26.708 --> 05:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
that means that you
 
05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
me every resident who does not own
 
05:34:33.030 --> 05:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
property on said lakes has the same
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
right to recreate on those lakes winter
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
and summer
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
the same right as someone who does own
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
lakes own land bordering
 
05:34:45.750 --> 05:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
the lakes
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
this bill repeals the prohibition which
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
became law in 2019
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
against the ohrvis which off highway
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles traveling on hoyt
 
05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
road marsh which is a lake that exceeds
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
10 acres in the city of concord
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
prior to the ban the local residents
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
complained of the noise and
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
environmental effect the riders
 
05:35:13.270 --> 05:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
testified they were on a large pond
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
surrounded by trees and were re
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
recreating legally on public ice they
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
testified that they were always
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
respectful to the residents and they
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
took care to avoid conflicts
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
with all the conflicting testimony you
 
05:35:35.548 --> 05:35:35.558 align:start position:0%
would think that prior to enacting the
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
2019 ban a site visit would have been
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
done by some committee
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
before a ban was passed
 
05:35:49.030 --> 05:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
and before it became law let's check the
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee record let's look at the file
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
but there is no record
 
05:35:58.230 --> 05:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
there is no file there was no site visit
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
there was no hearing there was no
 
05:36:04.470 --> 05:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee there was no bill
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
but amazingly
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
as if by magic
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
and written by the fiery finger of
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%

took

05:36:49.750 --> 05:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
took

a site visit now
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
by the present committee
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
hearing this that heard this appeal
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
would be useless
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
the statue enacted the term enacted the

forced the activity of the writers to

forced the activity of the writers to

cease

cease
so

05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
there was nothing to see
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to hear it was like the body had

intervention aren't enough to justify
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
the committee's recommendation of ought
 
05:38:40.230 --> 05:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
the present
 
05:38:41.840 --> 05:38:43.510 align:start position:0%
the present
house

05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:38:45.590 --> 05:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
house resources recreation and
 
05:38:47.190 --> 05:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
development committee
 
05:38:47.200 --> 05:38:48.310 align:start position:0%
development committee
still

05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
had sufficient credible evidence from a
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
reputable source to reach a decision
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
the pond and much of its environs is
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:39:01.030 --> 05:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
control of the new hampshire fish and
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
game department the department testimony
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
to the resources committee favored the
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
position of the riders they had purse
 
05:39:10.708 --> 05:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
they had
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
processed some complaints from abutters
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
prior to the ban and came down on the
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
side of the riders they also testified
 
05:39:22.470 --> 05:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
that no outright bans like this exist in
 
05:39:23.830 --> 05:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
this state
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
except this one passed in 2019.
 
05:39:31.110 --> 05:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
there are two paths that bring the
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee to the same result
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
one way is evidentiary
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
we have two adversarial parties each
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
presenting conflicting testimony in a
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
court of law the testimony of a neutral
 
05:39:46.470 --> 05:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
party or known trusted entity
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
like the department of fish and game
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
would carry considerable weight
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
it is also
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
that alone is sufficient to pass this
 
05:39:59.750 --> 05:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
the other path is more complicated
 
05:40:05.590 --> 05:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of how we got there the
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
statute was created without public input
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
a group of people lost a right without
 
05:40:14.948 --> 05:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
any knowledge or chance to defend
 
05:40:14.958 --> 05:40:16.548 align:start position:0%
any knowledge or chance to defend
themselves

05:40:16.548 --> 05:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:40:16.558 --> 05:40:17.430 align:start position:0%
themselves
isn't

05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the physical conflict isn't that the
 
05:40:22.708 --> 05:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
definition of a sucker punch
 
05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
what point at what point does expediency
 
05:40:29.430 --> 05:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
trump procedure at what point do our
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
rules and procedures cease to be in
 
05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
violent and become suggestions
 
05:40:38.230 --> 05:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker our strength is that we are
 
05:40:41.910 --> 05:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
400 plain ordinary citizens making a
 
05:40:43.830 --> 05:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
hundred bucks a year
 
05:40:46.470 --> 05:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
the only thing of value we get is our
 
05:40:46.480 --> 05:40:47.830 align:start position:0%
the only thing of value we get is our
self-respect

05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
self-respect
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
and our integrity
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
when you press the green button you will
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
be in fact be pressing the reset button
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
all parties will go back to their status
 
05:41:02.470 --> 05:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
before the statute of 2019 was passed
 
05:41:04.948 --> 05:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
all would be made whole again it is then
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
that the writers and abutters will have
 
05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
equal access to the system of government
 
05:41:13.910 --> 05:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and justice all expect and when they ask
 
05:41:16.470 --> 05:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we show them our badges we can
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
proudly show them our badges and assure
 
05:41:21.750 --> 05:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
them that we stand ready to serve them
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
in the best of our ability with firmness
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the right that god gives us the right
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
to see that right
 
05:41:31.190 --> 05:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:32.590 --> 05:41:32.600 align:start position:0%

if i know the repeal and the prohibition
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
on ohiv's on the marsh will lead to
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
traffic ingestion noise trash
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
and waste accumulation an area making
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
passive recreation
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
less enjoyable and almost impossible
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that during the
 
05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
three winters since the prohibition was
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
that those who enjoyed the sport of
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
racing motorcycles on ice have found
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
other opportunities on ponds in both
 
05:44:06.948 --> 05:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
cronkite and the lakes region
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
that one of my greatest memories from
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
being born and raised in the city of
 
05:44:12.558 --> 05:44:13.670 align:start position:0%
being born and raised in the city of
concord

05:44:13.670 --> 05:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
concord
 
05:44:15.990 --> 05:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
was spending summers with my dad fishing
 
05:44:18.150 --> 05:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
for han powder on the banks
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the hoyt marsh
 
05:44:22.310 --> 05:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
and it would break my heart to see
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
that marsh just boiled
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
as it was in the past
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
would i now push the red button so
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
another motion could be brought forward
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.070 --> 05:44:36.080 align:start position:0%

parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
speaker

05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
if i know that bodies of water over 10
 
05:44:44.788 --> 05:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
acres are state-owned public resources
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
if i believe
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
the rights of landowners who abut these
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
resources do not outweigh the rights of
 
05:44:52.708 --> 05:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
the general public that use them
 
05:44:54.070 --> 05:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
if i know that the new hampshire fish
 
05:44:55.990 --> 05:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
and game department who also supports
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill has never had to issue a
 
05:45:01.190 --> 05:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
violation to any of the ohiv riders on
 
05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
hoyt road marsh
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know the
 
05:45:07.750 --> 05:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
current prohibition on ohrvis has all
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
the signs of political favor for a
 
05:45:12.230 --> 05:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
special interest would i now press the
 
05:45:15.830 --> 05:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%

the offices of dentists are far safer
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
effective and more controllable than
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
haphazardly dumping a known toxic

millions of dollars fighting fluorinated
 
05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbons in our water yet

all right the house had come to order
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for
 
06:02:36.310 --> 06:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um if i know that new
 
06:02:42.390 --> 06:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire's clean energy market ranks
 
06:02:44.548 --> 06:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
dead last in the northeast
 
06:02:46.788 --> 06:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
and if i know that artificially holding
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
back the free market by picking winners
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
and losers for net metered energy
 
06:02:54.470 --> 06:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
results in higher transmission costs
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
so it's pennywise and pound foolish
 
06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
and if i get that prolonged inaction
 
06:03:03.430 --> 06:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
on support of local energy production
 
06:03:06.310 --> 06:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
leads to the heaviest consumer costs
 
06:03:07.830 --> 06:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
like the new hampshire utilities
 
06:03:10.070 --> 06:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
predicted 40 percent increase
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
in 2022 fuel costs which we have
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
provided no strategies to avoid
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
then will i now press the green button
 
06:03:21.670 --> 06:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill that would not transfer
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
costs to non-producers
 
06:03:27.750 --> 06:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
but rather establish a sensible way
 
06:03:29.830 --> 06:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
forward for the state of new hampshire's
 
06:03:32.708 --> 06:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
clean energy markets to diversify our
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
giving consumers choice
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
and limiting monopoly
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:47.830 --> 06:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry this is the lay on the
 
06:03:49.510 --> 06:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
table yes it is
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
we definitely do not want to lay it on
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
the table so that's okay will you please
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%

06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that those bills were subsequently
 
06:04:21.750 --> 06:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor and those vetoes
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
were sustained
 
06:04:26.070 --> 06:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button
 
06:04:28.150 --> 06:04:28.160 align:start position:0%

new hampshire communities to build more
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
energy flexibility and resilience
 
06:14:23.190 --> 06:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that unh and some of the
 
06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
other utilities have already been
 
06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
experimenting with this concept
 
06:14:29.430 --> 06:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that we should document their
 
06:14:32.470 --> 06:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
experience both good and bad and that
 
06:14:35.430 --> 06:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
that ex that experiment has now come to
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
an end
 
06:14:39.030 --> 06:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
which needs to be solved
 
06:14:41.350 --> 06:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that communities

06:14:45.110 --> 06:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
for their town
 
06:14:47.590 --> 06:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
might want to consider building a local
 
06:14:49.990 --> 06:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
microgrid as part of their
 
06:14:53.750 --> 06:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
energy future energy designs

06:26:32.708 --> 06:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
very much mr speaker
 
06:26:34.708 --> 06:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
back in november i subbed on science and
 
06:26:36.150 --> 06:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
technology and energy i'm using a
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
judiciary it was an interesting day good
 
06:26:39.670 --> 06:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
change of pace
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
and we disposed of eight count of eight
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
commission and study committee bills
 
06:26:46.390 --> 06:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
i've sponsored
 
06:26:47.990 --> 06:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
some of those bills myself but it's hard
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
to get too worked up for over these
 
06:26:51.110 --> 06:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
bills the end result these bills
 
06:26:53.590 --> 06:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
typically a report which in rare cases
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
no one ever reads and it's pretty hard
 
06:26:57.030 --> 06:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
to find them even if you do want to read
 
06:26:57.040 --> 06:26:58.708 align:start position:0%
to find them even if you do want to read
them

06:26:58.708 --> 06:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:26:59.750 --> 06:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:27:01.350 --> 06:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
there were six bills two of them were
 
06:27:02.868 --> 06:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
not controversial we just passed one a
 
06:27:04.548 --> 06:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
second ago another one was on regular
 
06:27:05.990 --> 06:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
calendar this there were six more that
 
06:27:08.230 --> 06:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
were controversial we just tabled five
 
06:27:10.868 --> 06:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
of the first six
 
06:27:13.590 --> 06:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
they were itl gym committee um
 
06:27:15.670 --> 06:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
and the stats basically the reasoning
 
06:27:17.430 --> 06:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
boiled down to is
 
06:27:17.440 --> 06:27:18.468 align:start position:0%
boiled down to is
um

06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
nobody really cares about these issues
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
anymore there's no need for the
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee there's nothing more to be
 
06:27:24.868 --> 06:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
found out about them
 
06:27:24.878 --> 06:27:25.670 align:start position:0%
found out about them
and

06:27:25.670 --> 06:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:25.680 --> 06:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
and
i

06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:27:28.070 --> 06:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
all the five the five that we just
 
06:27:29.910 --> 06:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
tabled those are issues at least my
 
06:27:31.750 --> 06:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
constituents are very worried about the
 
06:27:34.948 --> 06:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
reliability the energy grid
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
06:27:37.910 --> 06:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
can i ask the member to suspend for a
 
06:27:40.230 --> 06:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
moment yes thank you that's getting
 
06:27:42.390 --> 06:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
really really noisy in here if the
 
06:27:44.948 --> 06:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
member has a right to be heard
 
06:27:46.390 --> 06:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
sorry please continue and finally there
 
06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
was broadband where i believe
 
06:27:49.990 --> 06:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm misinterpreting believe we
 
06:27:51.350 --> 06:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
said like we already know everything
 
06:27:53.110 --> 06:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's about the topics there's no need
 
06:27:55.350 --> 06:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
to study it anymore but certainly
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
i hear from mikey statements all the
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
time about each of those three topics
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
which brings us to the next one this one
 
06:28:03.030 --> 06:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
which is about uh
 
06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy and i hear a lot about
 
06:28:06.788 --> 06:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
for my constituents too we don't want
 
06:28:07.990 --> 06:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
any nukes we've been living in the
 
06:28:09.990 --> 06:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
shadow of seabrook for
 
06:28:12.070 --> 06:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
almost 50 years now
 
06:28:13.990 --> 06:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
and you know we've had uh
 
06:28:15.670 --> 06:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
we've had disasters in pennsylvania at
 
06:28:17.350 --> 06:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
three mile island
 
06:28:17.360 --> 06:28:18.310 align:start position:0%
three mile island
in

06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
ukraine and chernobyl and
 
06:28:22.788 --> 06:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
most recently a few years ago in japan
 
06:28:24.548 --> 06:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
and fukushima
 
06:28:25.910 --> 06:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want that happening on the
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
seacoast of new hampshire and
 
06:28:29.510 --> 06:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's a long laundry list of
 
06:28:29.520 --> 06:28:31.350 align:start position:0%
there's a long laundry list of
technologies

06:28:31.350 --> 06:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
06:28:32.548 --> 06:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
most of which
 
06:28:34.070 --> 06:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's fine somebody wants to study them
 
06:28:36.070 --> 06:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure what a
 
06:28:36.080 --> 06:28:37.110 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure what a
commission

06:28:37.110 --> 06:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:28:39.190 --> 06:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislative commission
 
06:28:41.750 --> 06:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
could add to it particularly with the
 
06:28:43.510 --> 06:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
resources we usually
 
06:28:45.590 --> 06:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
give those committees which is basically
 
06:28:45.600 --> 06:28:46.468 align:start position:0%
give those committees which is basically
nothing

06:28:46.468 --> 06:28:46.478 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
06:28:46.478 --> 06:28:48.468 align:start position:0%
nothing
so

06:28:48.468 --> 06:28:48.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:28:51.110 --> 06:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
also nuclear power technology it's not
 
06:28:51.120 --> 06:28:51.910 align:start position:0%
also nuclear power technology it's not
safe

06:28:51.910 --> 06:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:28:53.510 --> 06:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's not renewable
 
06:28:55.350 --> 06:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
and actually it isn't even carbon free
 
06:28:57.750 --> 06:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
despite what was said in the blurb so
 
06:28:59.350 --> 06:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
we don't want nukes here in new
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we certainly don't need
 
06:29:05.190 --> 06:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
another commission as the
 
06:29:06.708 --> 06:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
chair of the science and technology
 
06:29:08.230 --> 06:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
energy pointed out
 
06:29:10.468 --> 06:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
we are supposedly awash in committees
 
06:29:14.150 --> 06:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
and commissions so this is definitely
 
06:29:15.190 --> 06:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
is definitely
 
06:29:17.350 --> 06:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
one more commission that we
 
06:29:18.548 --> 06:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
at least the people of new hampshire
 
06:29:21.830 --> 06:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
that i hear from do not want so please
 
06:29:23.830 --> 06:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
please vote red on the otp so an
 
06:29:26.830 --> 06:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
alternative motion can be introduced
 
06:29:31.350 --> 06:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:42.150 --> 06:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:43.270 --> 06:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
the member from portsmouth
 
06:29:44.868 --> 06:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative samson is recognized to
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
speak against the committee report
 
06:29:51.430 --> 06:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you mr speaker
 
06:29:54.150 --> 06:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the house
 
06:29:56.708 --> 06:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
i ask you to overturn this committee
 
06:30:00.948 --> 06:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
recommendation of h for hb 543
 
06:30:03.190 --> 06:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
which calls for a commission to be
 
06:30:05.670 --> 06:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
established to study nuclear power and
 
06:30:09.270 --> 06:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
reactor technology in new hampshire
 
06:30:11.670 --> 06:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of your personal feelings
 
06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
regarding nuclear energy you should
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
consider that the goals of this
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
commission are very broad and very
 
06:30:21.510 --> 06:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
technical and that most of the issues
 
06:30:24.310 --> 06:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
referenced in this bill are not under
 
06:30:26.150 --> 06:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the state of new
 
06:30:29.110 --> 06:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire but are in fact purview of the
 
06:30:31.110 --> 06:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:30:33.590 --> 06:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
i am personally i have personally been a
 
06:30:36.708 --> 06:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
career physicist for approximately 45
 
06:30:36.718 --> 06:30:37.750 align:start position:0%
career physicist for approximately 45
years

06:30:37.750 --> 06:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:30:40.150 --> 06:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
including positions involving nuclear
 
06:30:43.990 --> 06:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
energy radioactivity and atomic physics
 
06:30:46.468 --> 06:30:46.478 align:start position:0%
during that time i had regularly
 
06:30:48.948 --> 06:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
encountered numerous scientists and
 
06:30:50.948 --> 06:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
listened to many talks on the very
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
subjects mentioned in this bill
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
and to be frank i would be very curious
 
06:30:58.628 --> 06:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
about reviewing many of them again after
 
06:31:00.390 --> 06:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
many years
 
06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
however i would consider this more of a
 
06:31:04.830 --> 06:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
science project that would be
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
complicated technically and very time
 
06:31:09.990 --> 06:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
consuming and not something that would
 
06:31:11.990 --> 06:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
have practical benefits for the state of
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:31:16.150 --> 06:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
if such a bill were more focused on a
 
06:31:18.628 --> 06:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
very few specific issues that had
 
06:31:20.468 --> 06:31:20.478 align:start position:0%
relevance for new hampshire
 
06:31:23.430 --> 06:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
it might be worth studying these issues
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
however however in its current form it
 
06:31:28.230 --> 06:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
is a bill that's addressing too many of
 
06:31:30.070 --> 06:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
these issues that the commission would
 
06:31:32.948 --> 06:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
not be able to handle in a sensible time
 
06:31:35.670 --> 06:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
span that is why i recommend that you
 
06:31:38.628 --> 06:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
vote to overturn the otp recommendation
 
06:31:40.628 --> 06:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
by pressing the red button
 
06:31:43.030 --> 06:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that an it motion can be made thank
 
06:31:46.468 --> 06:31:46.478 align:start position:0%
you very much mr speaker thank you
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
the member from londonderry
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized to
 
06:31:54.708 --> 06:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:56.708 --> 06:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:31:58.468 --> 06:31:58.478 align:start position:0%
here's the speaker
 
06:31:59.990 --> 06:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
06:32:02.628 --> 06:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
our father's nuclear technology
 
06:32:05.190 --> 06:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're in 2022
 
06:32:06.788 --> 06:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
there is new new
 
06:32:09.110 --> 06:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear technology out there
 
06:32:13.590 --> 06:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
having recently returned from an ncsl
 
06:32:15.910 --> 06:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
conference as a member of the energy
 
06:32:18.708 --> 06:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
task force we received the briefing on
 
06:32:19.830 --> 06:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the new
 
06:32:21.910 --> 06:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
new nuclear technology specifically
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
small scale nuclear module tech
 
06:32:24.558 --> 06:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
small scale nuclear module tech
technology

06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
technology
 
06:32:29.510 --> 06:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's out there and it's it's uh usable
 
06:32:32.150 --> 06:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
even the air force is buying one and
 
06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
having installed up in alaska
 
06:32:38.310 --> 06:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the new type of
 
06:32:40.230 --> 06:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
technology that can really help our
 
06:32:40.240 --> 06:32:41.910 align:start position:0%
technology that can really help our
state

06:32:41.910 --> 06:32:41.920 align:start position:0%

nuclear

06:32:46.628 --> 06:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
06:32:48.948 --> 06:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
energy as green
 
06:32:51.830 --> 06:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy will have zero emissions
 
06:32:54.310 --> 06:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
now it may not be in the short term but
 
06:32:56.468 --> 06:32:56.478 align:start position:0%
we need to start a conversation
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
on how we can adapt
 
06:33:01.510 --> 06:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
if possible any type of this new nuclear
 
06:33:04.150 --> 06:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
technology to help us produce zero
 
06:33:06.390 --> 06:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
emissions in a much more efficient way
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
than we're doing now
 
06:33:09.750 --> 06:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
the proposed commission
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
would work with the department of
 
06:33:13.350 --> 06:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear regulatory commission department
 
06:33:13.360 --> 06:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
nuclear regulatory commission department
of

06:33:14.070 --> 06:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:33:16.948 --> 06:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
of energy and many other agencies that
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
we have listed in this
 
06:33:18.878 --> 06:33:19.910 align:start position:0%
we have listed in this
commission

06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:33:21.830 --> 06:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
to uh to talk about the theoretical
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
viable options that that we can focus on
 
06:33:28.548 --> 06:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
i urge the people the court here
 
06:33:31.750 --> 06:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
to look and adopt this commission that
 
06:33:34.548 --> 06:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
we can study this new technology and
 
06:33:36.548 --> 06:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
possibly even eliminate some of the
 
06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear waste that the current
 
06:33:40.548 --> 06:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
technology is providing
 
06:33:43.270 --> 06:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
the committee voted 15-6
 
06:33:46.150 --> 06:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
to establish this committee i urge
 
06:33:48.708 --> 06:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
the legislatures here to vote green on
 
06:33:49.990 --> 06:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
this commission

considered the same and being unable to
 
06:35:20.788 --> 06:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the

06:35:38.468 --> 06:35:38.478 align:start position:0%
the member from concord representative
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
mick williams is recognized to speak

06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:49.990 --> 06:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's latest three-year energy
 
06:35:51.670 --> 06:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency plan
 
06:35:53.670 --> 06:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
would have produced significant cost
 
06:35:56.390 --> 06:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
savings for all new hampshire ratepayers
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
in the hundreds of millions of dollars
 
06:36:01.270 --> 06:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
why because energy efficiency is the
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
cheapest form of energy it's the energy
 
06:36:06.070 --> 06:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to buy because you don't
 
06:36:07.510 --> 06:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
need to use it
 
06:36:09.350 --> 06:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
the 2020 plan
 
06:36:11.190 --> 06:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
would have increased funding for the new
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves program which is a
 
06:36:17.590 --> 06:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
proven cost cutting program with roughly
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
150 million to 350 million dollars
 
06:36:23.830 --> 06:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
returned to new hampshire citizens for
 
06:36:25.990 --> 06:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency projects
 
06:36:28.230 --> 06:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
this would have insulated town halls
 
06:36:29.910 --> 06:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
installed money-saving heat pumps and
 
06:36:31.590 --> 06:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and residences across the
 
06:36:31.600 --> 06:36:33.750 align:start position:0%
businesses and residences across the
state

06:36:33.750 --> 06:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:36:36.390 --> 06:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
allowed our own small business owners to
 
06:36:36.400 --> 06:36:37.430 align:start position:0%
allowed our own small business owners to
perform

06:36:37.430 --> 06:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
perform
 
06:36:39.430 --> 06:36:39.440 align:start position:0%

programs

06:36:40.468 --> 06:36:40.478 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:36:40.478 --> 06:36:41.190 align:start position:0%
programs
and

06:36:41.190 --> 06:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:43.350 --> 06:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
increased our small businesses who do
 
06:36:45.350 --> 06:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency work in this nascent
 
06:36:46.868 --> 06:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
and growing
 
06:36:46.878 --> 06:36:48.548 align:start position:0%
and growing
industry

06:36:48.548 --> 06:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
industry
 
06:36:50.310 --> 06:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
this would have reduced electricity
 
06:36:52.310 --> 06:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
bills across the board for all new
 
06:36:53.750 --> 06:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
06:36:55.430 --> 06:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
not just for the owners of the buildings
 
06:36:57.990 --> 06:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
who receive an energy efficiency audit
 
06:37:00.788 --> 06:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
and insulation or blower door program
 
06:37:03.510 --> 06:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
because the prices we pay for energy
 
06:37:07.030 --> 06:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
reflect our combined total use
 
06:37:08.948 --> 06:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
these prices go up with increased use
 
06:37:10.708 --> 06:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
especially in the highest cost peak
 
06:37:10.718 --> 06:37:12.548 align:start position:0%
especially in the highest cost peak
periods

06:37:12.548 --> 06:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
periods
 
06:37:14.310 --> 06:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
the authors of this amendment do not
 
06:37:15.990 --> 06:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that energy efficiency
 
06:37:18.310 --> 06:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
investments pay off year after year and
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
provide accelerating value over time the
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
focus is on the short term outlay when
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the overall long-term
 
06:37:24.798 --> 06:37:26.150 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the overall long-term
results

06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
results
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you switch out light bulbs that use
 
06:37:29.910 --> 06:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
one-sixth of the energy
 
06:37:29.920 --> 06:37:30.708 align:start position:0%
one-sixth of the energy
or

06:37:30.708 --> 06:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:37:34.150 --> 06:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
install appliances that are 250 percent
 
06:37:36.150 --> 06:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
more energy efficient
 
06:37:38.230 --> 06:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
or you add insulation that keeps heat
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
inside your building you cut your energy
 
06:37:41.040 --> 06:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
inside your building you cut your energy
use

06:37:41.910 --> 06:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
and that cuts not only energy bills
 
06:37:46.788 --> 06:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
but also the amount of energy needed
 
06:37:48.390 --> 06:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
across the grid
 
06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency cuts energy costs and
 
06:37:53.430 --> 06:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
prices let's be clear this amendment
 
06:37:54.788 --> 06:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
does one thing
 
06:37:57.910 --> 06:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
it cuts energy efficiency funding
 
06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
putting cost-effective upfront
 
06:38:02.468 --> 06:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
investments out of reach for towns
 
06:38:04.868 --> 06:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
businesses and families
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire saves programs are
 
06:38:09.190 --> 06:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
subjected to a rigorous cost benefit
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
analysis which ensures that this program
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
provides benefits that exceed their cost
 
06:38:17.510 --> 06:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
on average the return is a two to one
 
06:38:19.830 --> 06:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire saves but frequently
 
06:38:22.390 --> 06:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's three and four to one
 
06:38:24.788 --> 06:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
it's estimated that under the 2020 plan
 
06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
the system's benefit charge which funds
 
06:38:29.110 --> 06:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire saves would save new
 
06:38:31.708 --> 06:38:31.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire electric customers
 
06:38:34.868 --> 06:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
525 million dollars over the first three
 
06:38:34.878 --> 06:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
525 million dollars over the first three
years

06:38:35.910 --> 06:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:38:39.110 --> 06:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
and 1.3 billion with a b
 
06:38:42.070 --> 06:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
dollars over 10 years we are currently
 
06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing peak utility costs in the
 
06:38:47.110 --> 06:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
winter in new hampshire all of our
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
constituents can benefit from reduced
 
06:38:50.868 --> 06:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
utility costs
 
06:38:52.628 --> 06:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
and yes this is called the system's
 
06:38:55.190 --> 06:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
benefit charge because it benefits all
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
users across the entire system
 
06:39:00.468 --> 06:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment would mean not
 
06:39:03.270 --> 06:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
making these cost-saving investments
 
06:39:04.788 --> 06:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
and that means you're being asked to
 
06:39:08.230 --> 06:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
vote to increase ratepayer bills by
 
06:39:10.948 --> 06:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars
 
06:39:14.230 --> 06:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
over 10 years by over a billion dollars
 
06:39:14.240 --> 06:39:15.830 align:start position:0%
over 10 years by over a billion dollars
unnecessarily

06:39:15.830 --> 06:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
at the expense of new hampshire's
 
06:39:19.990 --> 06:39:20.000 align:start position:0%

06:39:22.948 --> 06:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
please fund new hampshire saves
 
06:39:24.788 --> 06:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
invest that money in new hampshire and

06:39:35.190 --> 06:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
defeat this amendment
 
06:39:37.750 --> 06:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:42.150 --> 06:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
member from epping representative vos is
 
06:39:43.590 --> 06:39:43.600 align:start position:0%

06:39:45.430 --> 06:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
majority amendment
 
06:39:47.350 --> 06:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker the majority
 
06:39:47.360 --> 06:39:48.628 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker the majority
amendment

06:39:48.628 --> 06:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:39:48.638 --> 06:39:51.350 align:start position:0%
amendment
2205

06:39:51.350 --> 06:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
2205
 
06:39:54.468 --> 06:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
sets the funding mechanism for energy
 
06:39:56.708 --> 06:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
efficiency in our state the system
 
06:39:58.548 --> 06:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
benefits charge
 
06:40:00.390 --> 06:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
into statute
 
06:40:02.708 --> 06:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
and it sets it at the highest level that
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:08.230 --> 06:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
it provides a mechanism
 
06:40:13.670 --> 06:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
to increase the system benefits charge
 
06:40:15.670 --> 06:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
by a stable and predictable amount
 
06:40:19.920 --> 06:40:21.110 align:start position:0%
by a stable and predictable amount
the

06:40:21.110 --> 06:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:40:23.110 --> 06:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
three-year average of the consumer price
 
06:40:27.510 --> 06:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
index plus 0.25 percent
 
06:40:29.590 --> 06:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
this will allow energy efficiency
 
06:40:31.670 --> 06:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
programs to grow
 
06:40:36.150 --> 06:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
in a stable and affordable manner
 
06:40:38.548 --> 06:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
and provides predictability to those
 
06:40:42.628 --> 06:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:44.868 --> 06:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
but more importantly than that
 
06:40:46.948 --> 06:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment will save
 
06:40:49.110 --> 06:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
ratepayers money
 
06:40:51.270 --> 06:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
it will keep increases in the system
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
benefits charge
 
06:40:55.510 --> 06:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
in an affordable range of some five to
 
06:40:57.430 --> 06:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
ten million dollars a year
 
06:41:00.310 --> 06:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
now that contrasts sharply with the
 
06:41:02.468 --> 06:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency plan that was proposed
 
06:41:04.390 --> 06:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the public utilities commission about
 
06:41:06.548 --> 06:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
a year ago that would have raised
 
06:41:09.510 --> 06:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
ratepayer charges by 30 to 70 million
 
06:41:13.670 --> 06:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:15.750 --> 06:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
so what that means to you and i as
 
06:41:17.430 --> 06:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
average rate players
 
06:41:19.270 --> 06:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
is the difference between a two to eight
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
dollar per month charge for energy
 
06:41:21.280 --> 06:41:22.548 align:start position:0%
dollar per month charge for energy
efficiency

06:41:22.548 --> 06:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
06:41:25.270 --> 06:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to an 8 to 16
 
06:41:29.190 --> 06:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.788 --> 06:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
but ultimately
 
06:41:32.070 --> 06:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
the most important thing that the
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
majority amendment does
 
06:41:35.350 --> 06:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
is it
 
06:41:38.468 --> 06:41:38.478 align:start position:0%
puts the legislature back in control of
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism for energy
 
06:41:40.878 --> 06:41:42.628 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism for energy
efficiency

06:41:42.628 --> 06:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
06:41:45.430 --> 06:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
since this funding mechanism mechanism
 
06:41:49.270 --> 06:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
is essentially a tax on electricity
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
only the legislature should have the
 
06:41:54.150 --> 06:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
authority or has the authority the
 
06:41:57.190 --> 06:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority to set that
 
06:41:57.200 --> 06:41:58.468 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority to set that
rate

06:41:58.468 --> 06:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
rate
 
06:42:01.670 --> 06:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
therefore i ask the members to
 
06:42:04.468 --> 06:42:04.478 align:start position:0%
accept the committee amendment
 
06:42:06.150 --> 06:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
it is the essence
 
06:42:07.350 --> 06:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:42:11.190 --> 06:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you the question is on
 
06:42:14.468 --> 06:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
majority committee amendment 2205
 
06:42:16.310 --> 06:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
for what reason does the member rise i
 
06:42:18.070 --> 06:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
need to call for a division vote mr
 
06:42:19.590 --> 06:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you
 
06:42:21.350 --> 06:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members

all right
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%

06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
if i know this amendment
 
06:43:41.110 --> 06:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
cuts funding for cost-effective new
 
06:43:43.510 --> 06:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves programs
 
06:43:46.150 --> 06:43:46.160 align:start position:0%

triennial plan
 
06:43:50.230 --> 06:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
06:43:52.948 --> 06:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
that losing these investment dollars
 
06:43:56.548 --> 06:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
results in raising electricity prices
 
06:43:59.590 --> 06:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
for ratepayers across the system
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
by hundreds of millions of dollars
 
06:44:06.310 --> 06:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
and if i also know
 
06:44:08.628 --> 06:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
that this amendment does nothing
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
to cut into the billions of new
 
06:44:13.110 --> 06:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire energy dollars that are being
 
06:44:16.310 --> 06:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
sent out of state annually or to cut our

fossil fuel use
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
would i then vote against this amendment
 
06:44:29.110 --> 06:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker
 
06:44:41.190 --> 06:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that amendment 2205 sets the
 
06:44:44.150 --> 06:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge at 2020 levels
 
06:44:45.830 --> 06:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
which is the highest level it's ever
 
06:44:48.070 --> 06:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
been in the history of the state
 
06:44:50.070 --> 06:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
and also allows for that
 
06:44:53.350 --> 06:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge to grow year over
 
06:44:56.150 --> 06:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
year by a formula that is both
 
06:44:59.990 --> 06:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
affordable and sustainable
 
06:45:01.430 --> 06:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
that amendment 2205
 
06:45:07.270 --> 06:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
puts the legislature back in control
 
06:45:11.110 --> 06:45:11.120 align:start position:0%

06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
even with the majority amendment is
 
06:47:45.910 --> 06:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
still seriously flawed
 
06:47:49.708 --> 06:47:49.718 align:start position:0%
we offer amendment 2 2021
 
06:47:53.510 --> 06:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
2299 as an important improvement
 
06:47:55.750 --> 06:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
ideas for it have been borrowed from
 
06:47:58.390 --> 06:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions made by one of our majority
 
06:48:00.548 --> 06:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
committee colleagues
 
06:48:02.948 --> 06:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses two critical
 
06:48:02.958 --> 06:48:04.548 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses two critical
issues

06:48:04.548 --> 06:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:48:06.868 --> 06:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
it addresses the request by the public
 
06:48:08.708 --> 06:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
utilities commissioners
 
06:48:11.190 --> 06:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
office of consumer advocate
 
06:48:14.390 --> 06:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
to explicitly put into their legislation
 
06:48:16.708 --> 06:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
the existence and role of the energy
 
06:48:21.110 --> 06:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency resource standard the eers
 
06:48:23.910 --> 06:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
and additionally it includes a badly
 
06:48:26.310 --> 06:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
needed simplification of the rules
 
06:48:29.270 --> 06:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
around the system's benefits charge
 
06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
but it firmly opposes the notion of
 
06:48:35.350 --> 06:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
setting low ceilings on that charge
 
06:48:37.990 --> 06:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
which is the primary funding mechanism
 
06:48:42.788 --> 06:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:44.230 --> 06:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
06:48:46.468 --> 06:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
this is the program that funds energy
 
06:48:49.270 --> 06:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency and renewable energy and is
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
currently critically underfunded
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
often running out of funds by july first
 
06:48:56.468 --> 06:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
of each year
 
06:48:58.548 --> 06:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
therefore this amendment does not
 
06:49:01.590 --> 06:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
include specific funding levels or a
 
06:49:03.910 --> 06:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
specific mechanism for annually
 
06:49:06.708 --> 06:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
increasing those funding levels
 
06:49:08.948 --> 06:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
that is because we believe that funding
 
06:49:11.990 --> 06:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
levels should be increased significantly
 
06:49:13.110 --> 06:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
and also
 
06:49:15.990 --> 06:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
because we have been assured by a senior
 
06:49:18.948 --> 06:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
member of the other body that the final
 
06:49:22.230 --> 06:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
version of hb 549 will undergo a
 
06:49:24.868 --> 06:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
complete replacement at which time
 
06:49:27.590 --> 06:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
needed fixes will be made
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is why this amendment is only a
 
06:49:32.150 --> 06:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
small down payment on that improvement
 
06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
we hope that will be made and which is
 
06:49:37.750 --> 06:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
why i ask you to give it your support so
 
06:49:40.390 --> 06:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
please press uh
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
please press the green button to uh
 
06:49:46.150 --> 06:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
support amendment 22.99
 
06:49:48.468 --> 06:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i request a
 
06:49:50.390 --> 06:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
06:49:52.628 --> 06:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
thank you the member from stratford
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
to speak against the four amendment
 
06:49:58.230 --> 06:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker um
 
06:49:59.430 --> 06:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of things i think we've got to
 
06:50:00.788 --> 06:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
get straight here because we're dealing
 
06:50:03.110 --> 06:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
with myths here rather than reality we
 
06:50:05.430 --> 06:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
keep being told over and over again no
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
matter how much money you spend on
 
06:50:09.670 --> 06:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency it's never enough if
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
you spend a million dollars people want
 
06:50:14.070 --> 06:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
10 million if you spend 10 million they
 
06:50:16.310 --> 06:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
want a hundred million the simple fact
 
06:50:18.070 --> 06:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
is that just throwing money at energy
 
06:50:20.548 --> 06:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
efficiency projects is not economically
 
06:50:22.788 --> 06:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
efficient if you have to spend a
 
06:50:24.708 --> 06:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to save the megawatt
 
06:50:27.190 --> 06:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
hour that you can buy for 50 dollars
 
06:50:30.788 --> 06:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
that's not a good plan for anybody so
 
06:50:32.868 --> 06:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
what backs this up all we have to do is
 
06:50:34.310 --> 06:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
look to our friends to the south
 
06:50:36.788 --> 06:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where they've spent
 
06:50:39.590 --> 06:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
money many many times on ndg fishermen
 
06:50:41.110 --> 06:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
see what we've had i believe it's in the
 
06:50:43.830 --> 06:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars now and yet the last
 
06:50:46.150 --> 06:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
time i checked the ever source rates for
 
06:50:48.230 --> 06:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
eastern massachusetts this is the whole
 
06:50:49.750 --> 06:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
total rate
 
06:50:51.510 --> 06:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
was slightly higher than the eversource
 
06:50:53.750 --> 06:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
rates in new hampshire if the if
 
06:50:55.670 --> 06:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
throwing huge amounts of money in energy
 
06:50:57.430 --> 06:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency was the solution to lower
 
06:50:59.270 --> 06:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
electric rates theirs would be much
 
06:51:02.468 --> 06:51:02.478 align:start position:0%
lower than ours not slightly higher
 
06:51:05.750 --> 06:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
so what does this amendment do is was
 
06:51:07.350 --> 06:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
just stated
 
06:51:07.360 --> 06:51:08.230 align:start position:0%
just stated
the

06:51:08.230 --> 06:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:51:09.990 --> 06:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
approved amendment majority amendment
 
06:51:12.548 --> 06:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
takes the authority for raising the
 
06:51:14.390 --> 06:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge and puts it where
 
06:51:16.628 --> 06:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
it belongs with the legislature it is in
 
06:51:19.830 --> 06:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
fact a tax now the system benefit charge
 
06:51:22.230 --> 06:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
is supposed to benefit the system but a
 
06:51:24.150 --> 06:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the money has little and no
 
06:51:26.548 --> 06:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
benefit to the system because when your
 
06:51:29.030 --> 06:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor's house gets insulated his oil
 
06:51:31.190 --> 06:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill goes down but his electric bill
 
06:51:33.110 --> 06:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
hardly changes at all it doesn't have
 
06:51:34.948 --> 06:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
any effect on the electric system one
 
06:51:36.468 --> 06:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
06:51:38.628 --> 06:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
so they take this this amendment would
 
06:51:41.670 --> 06:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
take that out and return it to
 
06:51:41.680 --> 06:51:42.868 align:start position:0%
take that out and return it to
the

06:51:42.868 --> 06:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:51:45.510 --> 06:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh what i assume is be the program that
 
06:51:47.270 --> 06:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
was rejected by the public utilities
 
06:51:49.430 --> 06:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission as being not efficient and
 
06:51:51.190 --> 06:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
way too costly
 
06:51:53.750 --> 06:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
so they want to put this uh thing in the
 
06:51:56.628 --> 06:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency resource standard into
 
06:51:59.270 --> 06:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
law that's the standard that resulted
 
06:52:01.270 --> 06:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
that was rejected by the puc because it
 
06:52:04.390 --> 06:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
was just way way overpriced so
 
06:52:06.788 --> 06:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
in closing just remember
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
throwing money at energy efficiency does
 
06:52:11.190 --> 06:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily save you money
 
06:52:13.430 --> 06:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is proof of that
 
06:52:14.948 --> 06:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge is
 
06:52:16.868 --> 06:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
effectively a tax and the setting of
 
06:52:19.270 --> 06:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
that charge belongs in the legislature
 
06:52:22.230 --> 06:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:24.628 --> 06:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:52:27.030 --> 06:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
before we move on
 
06:52:30.150 --> 06:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
we've got a bipartisan problem here
 
06:52:32.708 --> 06:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
both sides are making a lot of noise and
 
06:52:34.230 --> 06:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to hear the speakers
 
06:52:35.270 --> 06:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
there i'm actually at the point where
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to calculate the noise level
 
06:52:39.270 --> 06:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm worried that if i stop
 
06:52:40.948 --> 06:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
and say everyone should quiet down while
 
06:52:43.830 --> 06:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
one's speaking will it look even-handed
 
06:52:45.910 --> 06:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be that way
 
06:52:48.150 --> 06:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
we should care that they put work into
 
06:52:49.350 --> 06:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
their speech
 
06:52:49.360 --> 06:52:50.150 align:start position:0%
their speech
that

06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:52:52.230 --> 06:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's hard to go up there and speak in
 
06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
front of hundreds of people and we
 
06:52:55.990 --> 06:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
should respect the work that they put
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
into this and just be quiet and listen
 
06:53:00.868 --> 06:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
to them i'm learning things listening to
 
06:53:02.390 --> 06:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
them so
 
06:53:03.670 --> 06:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
let's just give them the respect that
 
06:53:08.230 --> 06:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:15.670 --> 06:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:17.590 --> 06:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:53:19.270 --> 06:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative samson should ask for a
 
06:53:21.110 --> 06:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
division vote this will be a division
 
06:53:25.670 --> 06:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:30.548 --> 06:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:30.558 --> 06:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
sure

06:53:51.030 --> 06:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:54.948 --> 06:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:57.270 --> 06:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
the question is on floor amendment
 
06:53:57.280 --> 06:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
the question is on floor amendment
2299-h

06:53:59.910 --> 06:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
2299-h
 
06:54:01.510 --> 06:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative mann is recognized for
 
06:54:03.670 --> 06:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
06:54:06.548 --> 06:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:54:08.110 --> 06:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that there is no
 
06:54:10.390 --> 06:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem
 
06:54:13.430 --> 06:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
with raising the system's benefit charge
 
06:54:16.070 --> 06:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
in that the constitution
 
06:54:21.030 --> 06:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
gives explicit permission for the public
 
06:54:25.350 --> 06:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
06:54:29.830 --> 06:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:33.510 --> 06:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:35.830 --> 06:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:54:37.830 --> 06:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of energy these energy
 
06:54:40.548 --> 06:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
efficiency projects are not just to save
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
money they also include reduction of co2
 
06:54:48.310 --> 06:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
emissions which has effects that may
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
concern our children and our
 
06:54:50.000 --> 06:54:51.910 align:start position:0%
concern our children and our
grandchildren

06:54:51.910 --> 06:54:51.920 align:start position:0%

06:54:58.708 --> 06:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
our economy the new hampshire economy
 
06:55:01.910 --> 06:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
dumps 85 to million 90 million dollars
 
06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
per year to import heating oil
 
06:55:07.190 --> 06:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
with the effects cascading down the

06:55:12.788 --> 06:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that a program of
 
06:55:15.910 --> 06:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
competent energy efficiency work
 
06:55:17.430 --> 06:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
on the willing
 
06:55:21.110 --> 06:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
owners of homes and other buildings
 
06:55:23.350 --> 06:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
would begin to stem this outflow of
 
06:55:23.360 --> 06:55:24.708 align:start position:0%
would begin to stem this outflow of
money

06:55:24.708 --> 06:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:55:27.190 --> 06:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
and over the long run would produce an
 
06:55:29.590 --> 06:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
accelerating and you have to do the math
 
06:55:30.948 --> 06:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
to see this
 
06:55:34.548 --> 06:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
an accelerating growth of savings that
 
06:55:38.390 --> 06:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:40.948 --> 06:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
and that the cost in any effect in any

and that the cost in any effect in any
event

06:55:41.830 --> 06:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
event
 
06:55:45.910 --> 06:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
is comparable to one or two or three
 
06:55:49.110 --> 06:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:50.788 --> 06:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
06:55:53.590 --> 06:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours saved by the led bulbs
 
06:55:53.600 --> 06:55:55.350 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours saved by the led bulbs
beating

06:55:55.350 --> 06:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
beating
 
06:55:57.910 --> 06:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
the system's benefit charge
 
06:56:00.708 --> 06:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
and if you can't afford three bulbs i'll
 
06:56:03.590 --> 06:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
show you how you can afford 20.
 
06:56:05.430 --> 06:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
remember suspend for a sec this is
 
06:56:06.548 --> 06:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
06:56:10.868 --> 06:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:12.948 --> 06:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to
 
06:56:12.958 --> 06:56:14.230 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to

06:56:35.670 --> 06:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
display
 
06:56:38.070 --> 06:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
close enough so that we can get control
 
06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
of our energy expense our co2 emissions
 
06:56:45.590 --> 06:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:46.948 --> 06:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
all right the house has come to order

recognized for parliamentary inquiry
 
06:56:53.670 --> 06:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
06:56:55.830 --> 06:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
know that this amendment would try to
 
06:56:58.150 --> 06:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
restore the flawed program that was
 
06:56:59.830 --> 06:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
rejected by the public utilities
 
06:57:02.150 --> 06:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
commission as being way too expensive
 
06:57:04.628 --> 06:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
and i know it would remove the authority
 
06:57:06.628 --> 06:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
for raising what is effectively a tax
 
06:57:08.468 --> 06:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
the system benefit charge from the
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
legislature and give it to an agency
 
06:57:13.030 --> 06:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
would i now push the red button and
 
06:57:17.190 --> 06:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:21.430 --> 06:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
the question is on floor amendment 2299h
 
06:57:23.670 --> 06:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
06:57:27.190 --> 06:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay making sure i have it right
 
06:57:28.708 --> 06:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor you'll press the
 
06:57:30.390 --> 06:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
green button if you're opposed you'll
 
06:57:32.230 --> 06:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
press the red button voting stations are
 
06:58:14.868 --> 06:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:17.030 --> 06:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
06:58:19.270 --> 06:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative lebranch

06:58:45.190 --> 06:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
of all members president had an
 
06:58:46.788 --> 06:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
06:58:48.070 --> 06:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
06:58:54.510 --> 06:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:57.590 --> 06:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
155 having voted in the affirmative 189
 
06:59:00.390 --> 06:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the negative the amendment fails
 
06:59:02.230 --> 06:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
and we are back to the majority
 
06:59:04.868 --> 06:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
committee report of octopass
 
06:59:06.708 --> 06:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
with the majority amendment the member
 
06:59:08.468 --> 06:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
from hollis representative mcgee is
 
06:59:09.670 --> 06:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak against the
 
06:59:15.350 --> 06:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:17.430 --> 06:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker nice to see you
 
06:59:17.440 --> 06:59:19.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker nice to see you
again

06:59:19.590 --> 06:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:59:22.310 --> 06:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
um house bill 549 is amended does
 
06:59:24.150 --> 06:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
several things that the minority
 
06:59:25.510 --> 06:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
disagrees with
 
06:59:27.190 --> 06:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
it lowers investment for energy
 
06:59:29.590 --> 06:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency at a time when the value of
 
06:59:31.830 --> 06:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
those investments is rising along with
 
06:59:34.628 --> 06:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
the rising fuel prices
 
06:59:37.350 --> 06:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
it halts essential forward progress as
 
06:59:38.948 --> 06:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
though the benefits of the new hampshire
 
06:59:42.230 --> 06:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
saves program have not been proven
 
06:59:43.990 --> 06:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
it calls for changes
 
06:59:46.708 --> 06:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
to the easy board's involvement and role
 
06:59:49.430 --> 06:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
in state energy planning and that's a
 
06:59:51.590 --> 06:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
board that myself and my colleague from
 
06:59:53.270 --> 06:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
eppong are both
 
06:59:54.948 --> 06:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
appointed house
 
06:59:57.270 --> 06:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
representatives to
 
06:59:59.030 --> 06:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
and those of us who've been in the
 
07:00:00.788 --> 07:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
legislature for a while know that
 
07:00:03.270 --> 07:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholder boards are a great deal for
 
07:00:04.628 --> 07:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:00:06.708 --> 07:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
and they are how we get incredible work
 
07:00:06.718 --> 07:00:07.670 align:start position:0%
and they are how we get incredible work
done

07:00:07.670 --> 07:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
done
 
07:00:10.948 --> 07:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
out of talented people for no money
 
07:00:12.788 --> 07:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
so in that way
 
07:00:15.270 --> 07:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
the easy board is truly an extension of
 
07:00:17.510 --> 07:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
our citizen legislature except that in
 
07:00:19.590 --> 07:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
the case of the easy board the members
 
07:00:21.990 --> 07:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
do often bring high levels of expertise
 
07:00:24.070 --> 07:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
to bear on the problems that we ask them
 
07:00:25.350 --> 07:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
07:00:27.190 --> 07:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
so we think that the easy board should
 
07:00:27.200 --> 07:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
so we think that the easy board should
have

07:00:28.310 --> 07:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:00:31.110 --> 07:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
that role in planning energy efficiency
 
07:00:34.468 --> 07:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
they are not politicians by design
 
07:00:36.788 --> 07:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
we see no reason uh to fix something
 
07:00:38.468 --> 07:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
that was not broken
 
07:00:41.190 --> 07:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
the minority also takes exception to the
 
07:00:43.510 --> 07:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
redefining of rate setting as being the
 
07:00:45.510 --> 07:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
role of the legislative or executive
 
07:00:47.110 --> 07:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
branches of government
 
07:00:48.948 --> 07:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
rather than the energy regulators who
 
07:00:51.110 --> 07:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
were supposed to remain separated by a
 
07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
bright red line when the new department
 
07:00:55.830 --> 07:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
of energy was sold to us as part of the
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill so the minority does
 
07:01:01.430 --> 07:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
not agree with the thrust of the bill as
 
07:01:01.440 --> 07:01:02.628 align:start position:0%
not agree with the thrust of the bill as
amended

07:01:02.628 --> 07:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
amended
 
07:01:02.638 --> 07:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
amended
however

07:01:04.070 --> 07:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
however
 
07:01:07.670 --> 07:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
hb 549 does provide a vehicle
 
07:01:10.390 --> 07:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
to fix the drastic upheaval
 
07:01:11.990 --> 07:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the public utility commission's
 
07:01:13.430 --> 07:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
november decision
 
07:01:15.350 --> 07:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
on the weatherization companies and
 
07:01:17.430 --> 07:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
utilities who administer the new
 
07:01:19.350 --> 07:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves program
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
although this bill does not leverage the
 
07:01:23.430 --> 07:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
return on investment of energy
 
07:01:25.750 --> 07:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency to the degree that we believe
 
07:01:27.590 --> 07:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire saves program has
 
07:01:27.600 --> 07:01:29.030 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire saves program has
earned

07:01:29.030 --> 07:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
earned
 
07:01:32.548 --> 07:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
passing hb 549 today although against
 
07:01:33.910 --> 07:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
our instincts
 
07:01:36.310 --> 07:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
will allow the legislative process to
 
07:01:36.320 --> 07:01:37.590 align:start position:0%
will allow the legislative process to
proceed

07:01:37.590 --> 07:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
07:01:39.830 --> 07:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
toward fixing what was broken by that
 
07:01:41.910 --> 07:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
puc order
 
07:01:44.070 --> 07:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
it will help restore the faith of new
 
07:01:45.750 --> 07:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire small businesses who are
 
07:01:48.628 --> 07:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
counting on us to reinstate essential
 
07:01:51.190 --> 07:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire saves funding
 
07:01:53.430 --> 07:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
we ask you to pass this far from
 
07:01:54.628 --> 07:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
terrific bill
 
07:01:56.628 --> 07:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
so that it has a chance to become a
 
07:01:59.750 --> 07:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
rescue vehicle for all the uncertainty
 
07:02:01.990 --> 07:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
imposed on the dedicated men and women
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
who weatherize our homes
 
07:02:05.590 --> 07:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
and love their purposeful new
 
07:02:08.230 --> 07:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based jobs because they know
 
07:02:09.430 --> 07:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we know
 
07:02:11.830 --> 07:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
their work has never been more needed
 
07:02:13.830 --> 07:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i ask for division vote
 
07:02:15.830 --> 07:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:02:17.350 --> 07:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
the member for mapping representative
 
07:02:19.030 --> 07:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
votes is recognized to speak in support
 
07:02:22.230 --> 07:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee report
 
07:02:24.548 --> 07:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:02:26.390 --> 07:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
as my distinguished colleague from
 
07:02:28.548 --> 07:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
hollis just pointed out
 
07:02:30.708 --> 07:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
house bill 549
 
07:02:34.310 --> 07:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
will address a current problem
 
07:02:36.948 --> 07:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
with our energy efficiency programs
 
07:02:40.310 --> 07:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission reset
 
07:02:42.468 --> 07:02:42.478 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge funding
 
07:02:45.910 --> 07:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism back to 2019 levels as of
 
07:02:48.708 --> 07:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
january 1st of 2022
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill
 
07:02:53.590 --> 07:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
those levels would be reset back up to
 
07:02:55.830 --> 07:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
the 2020 level which as i mentioned
 
07:02:59.270 --> 07:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
earlier is the historic high for the
 
07:03:01.510 --> 07:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
07:03:03.750 --> 07:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
 
07:03:03.760 --> 07:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
hb549

07:03:05.910 --> 07:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
hb549
 
07:03:05.920 --> 07:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
hb549
addresses

07:03:07.270 --> 07:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
07:03:10.468 --> 07:03:10.478 align:start position:0%
a significant problem
 
07:03:13.110 --> 07:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
for the lowest income rate payers in new
 
07:03:13.120 --> 07:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
for the lowest income rate payers in new
hampshire

07:03:15.270 --> 07:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:03:16.948 --> 07:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
they suffer the most
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
when electricity prices go
 
07:03:21.430 --> 07:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
sky high
 
07:03:23.750 --> 07:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's because they pay proportionally
 
07:03:23.760 --> 07:03:24.548 align:start position:0%
that's because they pay proportionally
more

07:03:24.548 --> 07:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:03:29.190 --> 07:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:31.590 --> 07:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
so taxes like the system benefits charge
 
07:03:33.030 --> 07:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
are regressive
 
07:03:35.430 --> 07:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
by nature
 
07:03:37.430 --> 07:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
and that makes it imperative that
 
07:03:39.990 --> 07:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
increases to the system benefits charge
 
07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be modest
 
07:03:45.030 --> 07:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they should be predictable
 
07:03:46.910 --> 07:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what
 
07:03:52.230 --> 07:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:54.468 --> 07:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
now we all know that energy efficiency
 
07:03:56.070 --> 07:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
07:03:56.080 --> 07:03:57.590 align:start position:0%
makes sense
everybody

07:03:57.590 --> 07:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
07:03:59.830 --> 07:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
should understand how it benefits their
 
07:04:03.990 --> 07:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:07.030 --> 07:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore some portion of sbc funds
 
07:04:09.910 --> 07:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
should be used to raise public awareness
 
07:04:13.430 --> 07:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the need for energy efficiency
 
07:04:16.150 --> 07:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
and hp 549 does that
 
07:04:16.160 --> 07:04:17.110 align:start position:0%
and hp 549 does that
by

07:04:17.110 --> 07:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
by
 
07:04:19.190 --> 07:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
allocating to the
 
07:04:21.510 --> 07:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and sustainable engine
 
07:04:24.150 --> 07:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
energy board the easy board
 
07:04:25.430 --> 07:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
07:04:28.788 --> 07:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
of sbc funds for the purpose of
 
07:04:31.670 --> 07:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
promulgating information about the
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:38.070 --> 07:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have to remember
 
07:04:39.990 --> 07:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
that people are somewhat reluctant to
 
07:04:42.150 --> 07:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
spend money on energy efficiency because
 
07:04:43.750 --> 07:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
07:04:46.548 --> 07:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
are up front you have to pay them first
 
07:04:50.390 --> 07:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
but the benefits accrue over time
 
07:04:52.310 --> 07:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so you don't really
 
07:04:54.948 --> 07:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
get what you pay for
 
07:04:57.910 --> 07:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
the day you hand over the check
 
07:05:00.150 --> 07:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
and that's one reason why people don't
 
07:05:02.230 --> 07:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
rush out to do energy efficiency
 
07:05:02.240 --> 07:05:05.670 align:start position:0%
rush out to do energy efficiency
projects

07:05:05.670 --> 07:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:07.430 --> 07:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
lastly i want to close here by saying
 
07:05:09.510 --> 07:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
reminding people that if you look it up
 
07:05:12.230 --> 07:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the dictionary a tax is defined as
 
07:05:12.240 --> 07:05:13.510 align:start position:0%
in the dictionary a tax is defined as
quote

07:05:13.510 --> 07:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
quote
 
07:05:15.670 --> 07:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
a sum of money demanded by a government
 
07:05:17.910 --> 07:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
for its support or for specific
 
07:05:20.070 --> 07:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
facilities or services
 
07:05:24.948 --> 07:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
levied on incomes property sales etc

or

07:05:27.190 --> 07:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:05:28.628 --> 07:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
putting again
 
07:05:31.430 --> 07:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
a burdensome charge obligation duty or
 
07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:36.628 --> 07:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
by this definition
 
07:05:39.430 --> 07:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge qualifies as
 
07:05:40.708 --> 07:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
a tax
 
07:05:43.430 --> 07:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
because it is demanded by government
 
07:05:48.310 --> 07:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:50.868 --> 07:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
and i would remind you all
 
07:05:53.190 --> 07:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire constitution
 
07:05:56.468 --> 07:05:56.478 align:start position:0%
authorizes only the general court
 
07:05:58.948 --> 07:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
to impose taxes
 
07:06:07.030 --> 07:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:08.628 --> 07:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
representative samson's request for roll
 
07:06:13.350 --> 07:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:15.270 --> 07:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
07:06:17.110 --> 07:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members please take
 
07:06:19.030 --> 07:06:19.040 align:start position:0%

07:07:22.230 --> 07:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker
 
07:07:24.868 --> 07:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
if i know that funds raised through the
 
07:07:27.670 --> 07:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
systems benefits charge pay for energy
 
07:07:30.548 --> 07:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs to the very popular
 
07:07:33.350 --> 07:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire states and if i know that
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
all our surrounding new england states
 
07:07:38.468 --> 07:07:38.478 align:start position:0%
are outperforming us in reducing energy
 
07:07:41.190 --> 07:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
demand through energy efficiency
 
07:07:43.510 --> 07:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
if i know that because we are falling
 
07:07:43.520 --> 07:07:44.868 align:start position:0%
if i know that because we are falling
behind

07:07:44.868 --> 07:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
behind
 
07:07:46.868 --> 07:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire will continue to pay a
 
07:07:48.628 --> 07:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
larger and larger part of our new
 
07:07:48.638 --> 07:07:49.750 align:start position:0%
larger and larger part of our new
england's

07:07:49.750 --> 07:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
england's
 
07:07:52.628 --> 07:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
energy transmission costs
 
07:07:56.150 --> 07:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
but if i also know
 
07:08:00.390 --> 07:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
that failing to pass this legislation
 
07:08:00.400 --> 07:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
that failing to pass this legislation
will

07:08:03.430 --> 07:08:03.440 align:start position:0%

07:08:11.270 --> 07:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
because of decisions at the puc
 
07:08:14.628 --> 07:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
that failing to pass this legislation
 
07:08:17.430 --> 07:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
will totally eviscerate the progress we
 
07:08:20.070 --> 07:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
have made toward reducing our energy
 
07:08:20.080 --> 07:08:21.190 align:start position:0%
have made toward reducing our energy
demand

07:08:21.190 --> 07:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
demand
 
07:08:22.150 --> 07:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
would i
 
07:08:24.070 --> 07:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
hold my nose
 
07:08:26.468 --> 07:08:26.478 align:start position:0%
and press the green button
 
07:08:35.990 --> 07:08:36.000 align:start position:0%

without holding my nose i'll just say
 
07:08:47.750 --> 07:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:49.910 --> 07:08:49.920 align:start position:0%

07:12:04.948 --> 07:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
had a majority
 
07:12:04.958 --> 07:12:05.910 align:start position:0%

07:12:09.350 --> 07:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
on a bill with an amendment

and that was sent to the clerk's office
 
07:12:16.548 --> 07:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
many months ago in i believe it was
 
07:12:20.230 --> 07:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
still october when it was sent
 
07:12:22.070 --> 07:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
07:12:25.030 --> 07:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the clerk and the speaker are very
 
07:12:27.190 --> 07:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
careful to make sure
 
07:12:28.548 --> 07:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:12:28.558 --> 07:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
that the
calendar

07:12:29.990 --> 07:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
07:12:32.548 --> 07:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
is accurate and appropriate and follows
 
07:12:34.628 --> 07:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
our rules
 
07:12:34.638 --> 07:12:36.468 align:start position:0%
our rules
today

07:12:36.468 --> 07:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:12:39.910 --> 07:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
about three minutes before a bill was
 
07:12:39.920 --> 07:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
about three minutes before a bill was
called

07:12:41.670 --> 07:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
called
 
07:12:42.868 --> 07:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
i was
 
07:12:45.590 --> 07:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
told by the clerk
 
07:12:48.390 --> 07:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
that you had ruled
 
07:12:51.350 --> 07:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that a majority amendment not a floor
 
07:12:53.910 --> 07:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment a majority amendment that has
 
07:12:57.270 --> 07:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
been in the calendar for ages
 
07:13:01.910 --> 07:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:05.350 --> 07:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i have ever seen that
 
07:13:05.360 --> 07:13:06.468 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i have ever seen that
happen

07:13:06.468 --> 07:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
happen
 
07:13:10.070 --> 07:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
i know i was not told about three until
 
07:13:11.830 --> 07:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
three minutes before
 
07:13:14.708 --> 07:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
i asked the clerk who was so courteous
 
07:13:17.350 --> 07:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
in telling me if in fact the chair of
 
07:13:20.548 --> 07:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
the committee knew about that and he
 
07:13:23.110 --> 07:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
said he did not think so but he would go
 
07:13:25.350 --> 07:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and tell the chair
 
07:13:25.360 --> 07:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
and tell the chair
and

07:13:27.110 --> 07:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:13:29.270 --> 07:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
i was
 
07:13:31.830 --> 07:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
flummoxed flabbergasted i don't know
 
07:13:37.110 --> 07:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
what word to use but the result of this
 
07:13:39.030 --> 07:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
of your decision
 
07:13:40.788 --> 07:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:13:43.430 --> 07:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
there are women in this state
 
07:13:45.910 --> 07:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
who are going to have to go through a
 
07:13:48.070 --> 07:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
non-medical procedure representative
 
07:13:49.670 --> 07:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's not a point of order you're now
 
07:13:51.030 --> 07:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get into making a
 
07:13:53.750 --> 07:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
speech then i will stop at this point
 
07:13:56.948 --> 07:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
and ask you just in a very respectful
 
07:13:56.958 --> 07:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
and ask you just in a very respectful
way

07:13:57.990 --> 07:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
07:13:58.000 --> 07:13:59.830 align:start position:0%
way
procedurally

07:13:59.830 --> 07:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
procedurally
 
07:14:02.310 --> 07:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
explain to me how something like this
 
07:14:04.948 --> 07:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
could happen in good faith thank you i
 
07:14:06.468 --> 07:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
will i will attempt to do that
 
07:14:09.030 --> 07:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i had
 
07:14:11.030 --> 07:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
200 bills
 
07:14:13.190 --> 07:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
that were retained
 
07:14:13.200 --> 07:14:14.830 align:start position:0%
that were retained
and

07:14:14.830 --> 07:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:18.150 --> 07:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i did not get to that bill
 
07:14:20.548 --> 07:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
right away when it was sent over
 
07:14:22.708 --> 07:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
when i was looking at it maybe about a
 
07:14:24.468 --> 07:14:24.478 align:start position:0%
week and a half ago
 
07:14:27.270 --> 07:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i took a close look at it
 
07:14:29.270 --> 07:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i took a close look at the original
 
07:14:29.280 --> 07:14:30.548 align:start position:0%
and i took a close look at the original
bill

07:14:30.548 --> 07:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:14:33.030 --> 07:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's when i determined that
 
07:14:35.750 --> 07:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
if it came up which it did not
 
07:14:38.390 --> 07:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
if that came up then i was
 
07:14:41.430 --> 07:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
inclined to say that it was not going to
 
07:14:43.590 --> 07:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
be germaine to the subject matter of the
 
07:14:47.990 --> 07:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:51.030 --> 07:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your explanation but i
 
07:14:53.350 --> 07:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
hope you understand
 
07:14:57.190 --> 07:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
that i can't quite get my mind around it
 
07:15:00.150 --> 07:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
as following the normal careful
 
07:15:03.270 --> 07:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
procedure that you and the clerk use
 
07:15:04.868 --> 07:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
07:15:07.510 --> 07:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
distressed about it and i wanted to make
 
07:15:09.830 --> 07:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
that point in the most respectful way
 
07:15:09.840 --> 07:15:11.270 align:start position:0%
that point in the most respectful way
possible

07:15:11.270 --> 07:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
possible
 
07:15:12.628 --> 07:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for doing that
 
07:15:19.670 --> 07:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:21.910 --> 07:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
the clerk has an announcement thank you
 
07:15:24.708 --> 07:15:24.718 align:start position:0%

staying overnight tonight at the hotel
 
07:15:28.948 --> 07:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
we've worked with the hotel to provide
 
07:15:31.350 --> 07:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
some flexibility on their cancellation
 
07:15:33.510 --> 07:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
policy to accommodate our situation of
 
07:15:35.670 --> 07:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
ending early for those of you who have a
 
07:15:37.670 --> 07:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
single night reservation for tonight and
 
07:15:39.670 --> 07:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
need to cancel as long as you have not
 
07:15:41.030 --> 07:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
checked into your room yet you can
 
07:15:42.868 --> 07:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
cancel your reservation without any
 
07:15:45.030 --> 07:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
penalty for those of you who stayed last
 
07:15:45.910 --> 07:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
night and would be cutting your
 
07:15:48.150 --> 07:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
reservation short by canceling tonight
 
07:15:49.910 --> 07:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
you should also be able to cancel your
 
07:15:53.820 --> 07:15:53.830 align:start position:0%
stay for tonight with no penalty
 
07:15:53.830 --> 07:15:58.310 align:start position:0%

07:22:43.430 --> 07:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question on the

614 as amended
 
07:23:23.590 --> 07:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is a poorly and illogically
 
07:23:26.548 --> 07:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
constructed legislative proposal
 
07:23:28.070 --> 07:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
07:23:30.788 --> 07:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to exempt
 
07:23:32.788 --> 07:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
all new hampshire state and local
 
07:23:32.798 --> 07:23:33.830 align:start position:0%

payment of a fairly allocated use-based
 
07:23:40.240 --> 07:23:41.270 align:start position:0%
payment of a fairly allocated use-based
share

07:23:41.270 --> 07:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
share
 
07:23:43.590 --> 07:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the costs of new hampshire's
 
07:23:47.830 --> 07:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
electricity renewable portfolio standard
 
07:23:49.830 --> 07:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
this means that these new hampshire
 
07:23:52.788 --> 07:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
government electricity users
 
07:23:54.070 --> 07:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
unlike all
 
07:23:56.070 --> 07:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
non-government users
 
07:23:59.270 --> 07:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
would no longer pay a very small fee
 
07:24:03.350 --> 07:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:06.150 --> 07:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour
 
07:24:08.070 --> 07:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
as the price of their continued
 
07:24:08.080 --> 07:24:09.750 align:start position:0%
as the price of their continued
participation

07:24:09.750 --> 07:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
participation
 
07:24:11.830 --> 07:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the state's renewable portfolio
 
07:24:14.070 --> 07:24:14.080 align:start position:0%

07:24:17.030 --> 07:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
as an in it unavoidable
 
07:24:17.040 --> 07:24:18.468 align:start position:0%
as an in it unavoidable
consequence

07:24:18.468 --> 07:24:18.478 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
07:24:21.350 --> 07:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
of this categorical exemption
 
07:24:23.910 --> 07:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
the fee for all non-governmental
 
07:24:25.750 --> 07:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
electricity users
 
07:24:27.750 --> 07:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
will increase
 
07:24:31.590 --> 07:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
because paradoxically and unsustainably
 
07:24:34.230 --> 07:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
the bill also provides that the
 
07:24:36.788 --> 07:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
non-paying government users
 
07:24:39.350 --> 07:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
will retain eligibility
 
07:24:41.270 --> 07:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
to receive funds
 
07:24:42.948 --> 07:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
and other benefits
 
07:24:44.548 --> 07:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
from the
 
07:24:47.190 --> 07:24:47.200 align:start position:0%

government users
 
07:24:54.070 --> 07:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
will thus become classic
 
07:24:55.750 --> 07:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
free riders
 
07:24:57.830 --> 07:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
reaping the benefits of the renewable
 
07:25:01.030 --> 07:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard program while freed
 
07:25:03.910 --> 07:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
from sharing in its costs
 
07:25:05.910 --> 07:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standards
 
07:25:08.070 --> 07:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
07:25:10.628 --> 07:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
will also lose capacity
 
07:25:12.310 --> 07:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
to make a difference
 
07:25:14.628 --> 07:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
because energy provider alternative
 
07:25:16.628 --> 07:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
compliance payments
 
07:25:18.708 --> 07:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
the sole source of funding for the

renewable energy fund
 
07:25:24.628 --> 07:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
will in inevitably inevitably
 
07:25:28.948 --> 07:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
be reduced by the fallout from this bill
 
07:25:31.510 --> 07:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
universal assessment on
 
07:25:34.628 --> 07:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
and payment by all users
 
07:25:37.190 --> 07:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
of a small renewable portfolio standard

consumption-based fee
 
07:25:41.510 --> 07:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
is at the very heart
 
07:25:45.350 --> 07:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
of this successful 14 year old program
 
07:25:47.110 --> 07:25:47.120 align:start position:0%

have been paying twice for the rps

again as taxpayers

no meaningful evidence has been produced
 
07:26:58.468 --> 07:26:58.478 align:start position:0%
supporting substantial

bill
 
07:27:06.788 --> 07:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
on the contrary
 
07:27:08.948 --> 07:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
utility testimony
 
07:27:11.430 --> 07:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
indicates that utility administrative
 
07:27:11.440 --> 07:27:12.388 align:start position:0%
indicates that utility administrative
costs

07:27:12.388 --> 07:27:12.398 align:start position:0%
costs
 
07:27:14.868 --> 07:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
would go up because of this bill
 
07:27:16.788 --> 07:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
new rate classes would need to be
 
07:27:19.990 --> 07:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
created and rate payers likely would
 
07:27:22.548 --> 07:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
would for those reasons alone
 
07:27:25.590 --> 07:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
end up with higher electricity bills
 
07:27:27.510 --> 07:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
so i urge you
 
07:27:30.150 --> 07:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
to vote no on the pending ought to pass
 
07:27:32.830 --> 07:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
motion and i request a division
 
07:27:35.510 --> 07:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
vote it's getting awful noisy in here we
 
07:27:38.788 --> 07:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
only got a few bills left
 
07:27:43.430 --> 07:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:44.868 --> 07:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:27:47.350 --> 07:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to face the audience it'll be
 
07:27:50.868 --> 07:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
a little maybe they'll pay attention
 
07:27:52.468 --> 07:27:52.478 align:start position:0%
thank you speaker
 
07:27:54.310 --> 07:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
i rise to support
 
07:27:58.468 --> 07:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
the otpa motion on house bill 614.
 
07:28:00.788 --> 07:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
the policy portion of this bill was
 
07:28:03.910 --> 07:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed by science and tech
 
07:28:07.350 --> 07:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
our job was not to redo that our job was
 
07:28:07.360 --> 07:28:08.708 align:start position:0%
our job was not to redo that our job was
twofold

07:28:08.708 --> 07:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
twofold
 
07:28:11.350 --> 07:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
our job and by the way this bill passed
 
07:28:14.788 --> 07:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
over with a good vote on february 24th
 
07:28:14.798 --> 07:28:15.670 align:start position:0%
over with a good vote on february 24th
from

07:28:15.670 --> 07:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:28:17.750 --> 07:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
the original policy committee and it was
 
07:28:21.030 --> 07:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
referred to us in ways and means
 
07:28:24.628 --> 07:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
what we did was we retained the bill
 
07:28:26.310 --> 07:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
partly because
 
07:28:28.948 --> 07:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
to understand the rps we required a
 
07:28:28.958 --> 07:28:30.468 align:start position:0%
to understand the rps we required a
tutorial

07:28:30.468 --> 07:28:30.478 align:start position:0%
tutorial
 
07:28:33.030 --> 07:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
in how that all worked
 
07:28:34.708 --> 07:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
in which science detect was very helpful
 
07:28:37.030 --> 07:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
in doing that for us
 
07:28:39.350 --> 07:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker our role in ways and
 
07:28:39.360 --> 07:28:41.030 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker our role in ways and
means

07:28:41.030 --> 07:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
means
 
07:28:42.788 --> 07:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
was really twofold
 
07:28:44.310 --> 07:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
one is to answer the question does this
 
07:28:46.150 --> 07:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill have the potential of lowering
 
07:28:48.548 --> 07:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
property taxes on municipalities
 
07:28:50.468 --> 07:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
and all other political subdivisions of
 
07:28:53.270 --> 07:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
the state political subdivisions
 
07:28:56.628 --> 07:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
our towns their school districts
 
07:28:56.638 --> 07:28:57.590 align:start position:0%
our towns their school districts
their

07:28:57.590 --> 07:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
07:28:59.510 --> 07:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
counties etc
 
07:29:01.110 --> 07:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
and does it have the potential of
 
07:29:03.590 --> 07:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
reducing demand for tax revenue from
 
07:29:05.750 --> 07:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
state revenue generating sources that
 
07:29:07.510 --> 07:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
was the first thing we had to look at
 
07:29:09.110 --> 07:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
the second was
 
07:29:11.430 --> 07:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
was will this bill have a detrimental
 
07:29:13.750 --> 07:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the on the renewable energy
 
07:29:13.760 --> 07:29:14.948 align:start position:0%
impact on the on the renewable energy
fund

07:29:14.948 --> 07:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
fund
 
07:29:17.910 --> 07:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
which is a dedicated fund primarily
 
07:29:20.150 --> 07:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
rep replenished by all alternative
 
07:29:22.788 --> 07:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
compliance payments paid by the utility
 
07:29:22.798 --> 07:29:23.830 align:start position:0%
compliance payments paid by the utility
companies

07:29:23.830 --> 07:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
companies
 
07:29:25.910 --> 07:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
if there are not enough renewable energy
 
07:29:25.920 --> 07:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
if there are not enough renewable energy
certificates

07:29:27.270 --> 07:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
07:29:28.948 --> 07:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
being sold
 
07:29:32.468 --> 07:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
for by the renewable energy producers
 
07:29:34.468 --> 07:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
now it took me a while to even figure
 
07:29:36.388 --> 07:29:36.398 align:start position:0%
out what those words meant
 
07:29:37.590 --> 07:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't expect everybody to
 
07:29:37.600 --> 07:29:38.948 align:start position:0%
and i don't expect everybody to
understand

07:29:38.948 --> 07:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:29:41.190 --> 07:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
how this all works but
 
07:29:43.510 --> 07:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill which is the current
 
07:29:44.948 --> 07:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
house position
 
07:29:47.350 --> 07:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
does three major things it exempts the
 
07:29:47.360 --> 07:29:48.468 align:start position:0%
does three major things it exempts the
state

07:29:48.468 --> 07:29:48.478 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:29:49.990 --> 07:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
and its political subdivisions from
 
07:29:51.830 --> 07:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
paying the portion of the the electric
 
07:29:53.910 --> 07:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
rates that pertain to the cost of a
 
07:29:55.990 --> 07:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with the renewable portfolio
 
07:29:57.430 --> 07:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
standard fine
 
07:30:00.468 --> 07:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
it also it states uh that providers
 
07:30:02.230 --> 07:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
which are the distributors of
 
07:30:04.548 --> 07:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
electricity shall not be subject to
 
07:30:06.628 --> 07:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
compliance for electric sales that have
 
07:30:10.070 --> 07:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
been exempted this reduces the number of
 
07:30:12.468 --> 07:30:12.478 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates
 
07:30:15.270 --> 07:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
that the electric utilities have to buy
 
07:30:17.910 --> 07:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
and thirdly it states that a political
 
07:30:19.910 --> 07:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state
 
07:30:23.830 --> 07:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
but not the state may by majority vote
 
07:30:25.590 --> 07:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
of the governing body
 
07:30:28.388 --> 07:30:28.398 align:start position:0%
elect to continue payment of the amounts
 
07:30:30.388 --> 07:30:30.398 align:start position:0%
as identified as cost of compliance with
 
07:30:31.830 --> 07:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the rps
 
07:30:34.070 --> 07:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
simply stated
 
07:30:37.270 --> 07:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
these subdivisions can opt out
 
07:30:41.350 --> 07:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
of this program of of the exemption
 
07:30:43.510 --> 07:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
07:30:44.868 --> 07:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
so so that's
 
07:30:47.190 --> 07:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
basically the policy that
 
07:30:49.110 --> 07:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't change that was the policy
 
07:30:49.120 --> 07:30:52.230 align:start position:0%
we didn't change that was the policy
committee

07:30:52.230 --> 07:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:54.788 --> 07:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
what we was passed by this body so it's
 
07:30:56.468 --> 07:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
kind of the house position
 
07:30:58.150 --> 07:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker the majority of ways and
 
07:31:01.670 --> 07:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
means committee concluded the following
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
with estimates of electric cost savings
 
07:31:06.230 --> 07:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
to the state in the range of 400 to 500
 
07:31:08.468 --> 07:31:08.478 align:start position:0%
000 annually and clear savings to
 
07:31:10.310 --> 07:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
07:31:12.388 --> 07:31:12.398 align:start position:0%
one example being epping
 
07:31:14.548 --> 07:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
that estimated it would reduce electric
 
07:31:16.548 --> 07:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
cost of three thousand dollars
 
07:31:18.230 --> 07:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
potentially leading to less pressure to
 
07:31:20.310 --> 07:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
raise state taxes
 
07:31:23.030 --> 07:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
and local property taxes this bill was
 
07:31:26.150 --> 07:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
has was was seen as a win for all
 
07:31:27.750 --> 07:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of new hampshire by the
 
07:31:30.230 --> 07:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee majority
 
07:31:30.240 --> 07:31:31.670 align:start position:0%
committee majority
second

07:31:31.670 --> 07:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:31:33.910 --> 07:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
in assessing the
 
07:31:36.948 --> 07:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
the the fund the renewable energy fund
 
07:31:36.958 --> 07:31:38.388 align:start position:0%
the the fund the renewable energy fund
so

07:31:38.388 --> 07:31:38.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:31:40.628 --> 07:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
the impact on the renewal g fund is very
 
07:31:42.788 --> 07:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
difficult to calculate
 
07:31:45.510 --> 07:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
although even the puc says in the fiscal
 
07:31:45.520 --> 07:31:46.628 align:start position:0%
although even the puc says in the fiscal
note

07:31:46.628 --> 07:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
note
 
07:31:49.430 --> 07:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
that there may be a decrease in these
 
07:31:49.440 --> 07:31:51.750 align:start position:0%
that there may be a decrease in these
funds

07:31:51.750 --> 07:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
07:31:53.030 --> 07:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
but what
 
07:31:54.468 --> 07:31:54.478 align:start position:0%
what they were really signaling is that
 
07:31:56.868 --> 07:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be an impact the
 
07:31:59.030 --> 07:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
majority of ways and means committee
 
07:32:01.190 --> 07:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
interpreted this as a possible but not a
 
07:32:03.590 --> 07:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
definite reduction
 
07:32:03.600 --> 07:32:05.110 align:start position:0%
definite reduction
in

07:32:05.110 --> 07:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:32:06.868 --> 07:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
in the alternative compliance payments
 
07:32:09.350 --> 07:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
which once again are the primary feeder
 
07:32:11.030 --> 07:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the fund
 
07:32:13.670 --> 07:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the fund the amount of acps that must
 
07:32:15.590 --> 07:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
be paid by the utility distribution
 
07:32:17.430 --> 07:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
companies are driven by
 
07:32:19.510 --> 07:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
many underlying factors it's a
 
07:32:21.590 --> 07:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
multivariate problem
 
07:32:25.670 --> 07:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated first the weather
 
07:32:29.030 --> 07:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
hot or cold rainy or dry windy not windy
 
07:32:30.468 --> 07:32:30.478 align:start position:0%
things that impact generation of
 
07:32:32.868 --> 07:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
07:32:35.030 --> 07:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
the more renewable energy produced the
 
07:32:37.830 --> 07:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
more reusable energy certificates
 
07:32:39.830 --> 07:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
that can be sold
 
07:32:43.110 --> 07:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
each year and that differs year to year
 
07:32:44.948 --> 07:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
second the overall amount of electricity
 
07:32:47.190 --> 07:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
sold which also varies by things like
 
07:32:49.750 --> 07:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
the weather a hot summer means more air
 
07:32:52.070 --> 07:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
conditioning use for instance the amount
 
07:32:54.110 --> 07:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
of energy sold dictates the number of
 
07:32:56.788 --> 07:32:56.798 align:start position:0%
reusable energy certificates that must
 
07:32:59.510 --> 07:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
be bought which also varies here to the
 
07:32:59.520 --> 07:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
be bought which also varies here to the
air

07:33:01.110 --> 07:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
air
 
07:33:04.628 --> 07:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
our rps program has a regional market
 
07:33:06.788 --> 07:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
of six new hampshire new england states
 
07:33:07.910 --> 07:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
and new york
 
07:33:09.510 --> 07:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
and what's the new renewable energy
 
07:33:11.590 --> 07:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
certificates are bought and sold the
 
07:33:13.590 --> 07:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill on such a large
 
07:33:15.590 --> 07:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
market of which new hampshire is such a
 
07:33:18.788 --> 07:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
small part will be extremely minimal
 
07:33:21.590 --> 07:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
to a point where the impact of the acp
 
07:33:23.990 --> 07:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
payments will hardly be felt again
 
07:33:26.230 --> 07:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
alternate compliance payments are paid
 
07:33:29.030 --> 07:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
by utility when
 
07:33:31.430 --> 07:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
when there aren't enough recs on the
 
07:33:32.788 --> 07:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
market to be bought
 
07:33:34.948 --> 07:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
evidence of the complexity of the uh on
 
07:33:37.190 --> 07:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the variables of
 
07:33:39.350 --> 07:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
that impact acp's
 
07:33:42.468 --> 07:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
department revenue source for the fund
 
07:33:45.350 --> 07:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
is the last five years of acp payments
 
07:33:47.990 --> 07:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
so if you look at fiscal years 2017 to
 
07:33:48.000 --> 07:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
so if you look at fiscal years 2017 to
2021

07:33:49.910 --> 07:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
2021
 
07:33:53.670 --> 07:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
those icp maintenance in 2017 were 2.7
 
07:33:55.350 --> 07:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
million then it went to 4.8 million and
 
07:33:58.948 --> 07:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
3.4 million and 3.9 million then 2.2
 
07:34:01.030 --> 07:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
million so a range of anywhere from 2.2
 
07:34:04.388 --> 07:34:04.398 align:start position:0%
million to 4.8 million over the last
 
07:34:06.310 --> 07:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
five years
 
07:34:09.270 --> 07:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
as you can see mr speaker
 
07:34:12.628 --> 07:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
this whole acp thing and what what funds
 
07:34:15.030 --> 07:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
the the fund
 
07:34:16.548 --> 07:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
is very variable
 
07:34:18.788 --> 07:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
year to year
 
07:34:21.350 --> 07:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
and with that mr speaker i will just say
 
07:34:21.360 --> 07:34:22.150 align:start position:0%
and with that mr speaker i will just say
that

07:34:22.150 --> 07:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:34:24.310 --> 07:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
the ways it means concluded that
 
07:34:26.310 --> 07:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
there's no we feel that there there will
 
07:34:29.110 --> 07:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
be a negligible uh
 
07:34:31.430 --> 07:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
impact on the removal of any fund
 
07:34:34.868 --> 07:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
that uh that will result from this bill
 
07:34:36.948 --> 07:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
and i i think i will leave it at that mr
 
07:34:36.958 --> 07:34:38.788 align:start position:0%
and i i think i will leave it at that mr
speaker

07:34:38.788 --> 07:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
07:34:40.388 --> 07:34:40.398 align:start position:0%
there were few amendments but nothing
 
07:34:43.030 --> 07:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
that was material to the bill
 
07:34:45.030 --> 07:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill
 
07:34:47.910 --> 07:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
and with that i hope everybody votes uh
 
07:34:50.150 --> 07:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes on the lgpa motion thank you mr
 
07:34:50.160 --> 07:34:51.030 align:start position:0%
yes on the lgpa motion thank you mr
speaker

07:34:51.030 --> 07:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
07:34:54.548 --> 07:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:54.558 --> 07:34:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
a1

07:34:55.670 --> 07:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
a1
 
07:34:57.670 --> 07:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes will the representative take a
 
07:34:57.680 --> 07:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
yes will the representative take a
question

07:34:59.910 --> 07:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:34:59.920 --> 07:35:00.788 align:start position:0%
question
the

07:35:00.788 --> 07:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:35:03.110 --> 07:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative does not take a question
 
07:35:05.270 --> 07:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:35:09.190 --> 07:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the majority
 
07:35:11.990 --> 07:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
report about to pass as amended on house
 
07:35:16.150 --> 07:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:23.830 --> 07:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:25.750 --> 07:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay i didn't hear the division a
 
07:35:27.350 --> 07:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
division has been called members will
 
07:35:31.190 --> 07:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:50.388 --> 07:35:50.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:50.398 --> 07:36:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:36:09.590 --> 07:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:11.590 --> 07:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote the chair
 
07:36:13.350 --> 07:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative mcgee for a
 
07:36:15.190 --> 07:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
07:36:17.350 --> 07:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:36:21.030 --> 07:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
if i know that house bill 614 proposes
 
07:36:24.388 --> 07:36:24.398 align:start position:0%
that state and town subdivisions reclaim
 
07:36:26.548 --> 07:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
pennies in energy
 
07:36:29.030 --> 07:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
clean energy compliance payments in
 
07:36:31.750 --> 07:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
exchange for losing the ability to save
 
07:36:34.708 --> 07:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
thousands on their energy bills forever
 
07:36:37.190 --> 07:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that no one testified in
 
07:36:39.510 --> 07:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill or these dramatic
 
07:36:42.230 --> 07:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
cuts to our energy project funding
 
07:36:43.910 --> 07:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
especially after they learned that as
 
07:36:47.030 --> 07:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
amended hp 614 would make
 
07:36:49.430 --> 07:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
utilities exempt from paying
 
07:36:51.910 --> 07:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
the into the renewable energy fund that
 
07:36:53.910 --> 07:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
pays back those dividends on our energy
 
07:36:53.920 --> 07:36:55.350 align:start position:0%
pays back those dividends on our energy
bills

07:36:55.350 --> 07:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
bills
 
07:36:57.350 --> 07:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the whole point of
 
07:36:59.190 --> 07:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
compliance payments is that they're
 
07:37:01.590 --> 07:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
designed to return more benefits to new
 
07:37:03.270 --> 07:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire energy customers than they
 
07:37:03.280 --> 07:37:04.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire energy customers than they
cost

07:37:04.150 --> 07:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
cost
 
07:37:06.388 --> 07:37:06.398 align:start position:0%
just like our energy efficiency programs
 
07:37:08.388 --> 07:37:08.398 align:start position:0%
that were recently
 
07:37:08.398 --> 07:37:09.910 align:start position:0%
that were recently
decimated

07:37:09.910 --> 07:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
decimated
 
07:37:12.548 --> 07:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
at the request of no one
 
07:37:14.150 --> 07:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
there will be a reduction in new
 
07:37:16.388 --> 07:37:16.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire's ability to offer grants and
 
07:37:18.310 --> 07:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
this will hurt our ability to move
 
07:37:20.708 --> 07:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
forward in this in this realm
 
07:37:22.708 --> 07:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
then would i be sure to push the red
 
07:37:26.150 --> 07:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
button to show that those who elected us
 
07:37:26.160 --> 07:37:27.030 align:start position:0%
button to show that those who elected us
uh

07:37:27.030 --> 07:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:37:28.708 --> 07:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
see that we understand that wrecking a
 
07:37:31.830 --> 07:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
good policy is just as bad as passing a
 
07:37:32.868 --> 07:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
bad one
 
07:37:33.990 --> 07:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:37:35.270 --> 07:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the representative
 
07:37:39.670 --> 07:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:42.468 --> 07:37:42.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:37:45.350 --> 07:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
if i know this bill as amended requires
 
07:37:48.150 --> 07:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
that the state political subdivisions be
 
07:37:49.990 --> 07:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
exempted from paying the portion of the
 
07:37:52.548 --> 07:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
electric rates that cover the cost of
 
07:37:55.110 --> 07:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with the renewable portfolio
 
07:37:55.120 --> 07:37:56.468 align:start position:0%
compliance with the renewable portfolio
standards

07:37:56.468 --> 07:37:56.478 align:start position:0%
standards
 
07:37:59.590 --> 07:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
and that electric suppliers are required
 
07:38:01.270 --> 07:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
to contract
 
07:38:03.670 --> 07:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
fall rates that exclude cost of
 
07:38:05.830 --> 07:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with the
 
07:38:08.948 --> 07:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards
 
07:38:12.388 --> 07:38:12.398 align:start position:0%
and if i know that any political devel
 
07:38:12.398 --> 07:38:13.830 align:start position:0%
and if i know that any political devel
subdivision

07:38:13.830 --> 07:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
07:38:16.868 --> 07:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
by majority vote of its governing body
 
07:38:18.868 --> 07:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
may elect to opt in
 
07:38:20.868 --> 07:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
to continue payment of the amount
 
07:38:24.070 --> 07:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
identified as cost of compliance
 
07:38:25.590 --> 07:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
with the renewable
 
07:38:27.430 --> 07:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards
 
07:38:30.230 --> 07:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that the policy
 
07:38:31.830 --> 07:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
portion of this bill
 
07:38:34.388 --> 07:38:34.398 align:start position:0%
was passed by the full house in february
 
07:38:36.150 --> 07:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
and referred to the ways and means
 
07:38:36.160 --> 07:38:37.510 align:start position:0%
and referred to the ways and means
committee

07:38:37.510 --> 07:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:38:38.948 --> 07:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
07:38:40.548 --> 07:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
07:38:42.150 --> 07:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
the majority of the ways and maine's
 
07:38:45.590 --> 07:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee concluded that no approachable
 
07:38:48.230 --> 07:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
negative impact the renewable energy
 
07:38:51.030 --> 07:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
fund would result from this bill

try to be quick but i think i need to
 
07:42:06.708 --> 07:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
give some explanation for why i ask that
 
07:42:09.430 --> 07:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
this be taken off the consent challenge
 
07:42:13.190 --> 07:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
currently rsa 632 a10
 
07:42:15.910 --> 07:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits convicted sex offenders from
 
07:42:18.708 --> 07:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
from obtaining employment or providing
 
07:42:21.750 --> 07:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer service in specific kinds of
 
07:42:24.388 --> 07:42:24.398 align:start position:0%
fields directed to providing services to
 
07:42:27.430 --> 07:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
children that is working as a teacher a
 
07:42:30.468 --> 07:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
day care worker a coach a boy or girl
 
07:42:33.030 --> 07:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
scout leader and there's also some
 
07:42:36.948 --> 07:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
language in it that arguably could be
 
07:42:39.590 --> 07:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
could be applied more broadly
 
07:42:42.388 --> 07:42:42.398 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the supreme court decided a case
 
07:42:44.628 --> 07:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
called state versus proctor
 
07:42:47.430 --> 07:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
which involved a convicted sex offender
 
07:42:50.468 --> 07:42:50.478 align:start position:0%
who opened his who after release from
 
07:42:52.708 --> 07:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
from his sentence opened his own
 
07:42:55.670 --> 07:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
landscaping business and hired a minor
 
07:42:57.030 --> 07:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
to work with him
 
07:42:58.868 --> 07:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
he was charged with violating this
 
07:42:58.878 --> 07:43:00.070 align:start position:0%
he was charged with violating this
statute

07:43:00.070 --> 07:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:43:02.628 --> 07:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
his counsel made two arguments the first
 
07:43:04.548 --> 07:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
was that the statute only applies to a
 
07:43:06.548 --> 07:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
person who works as an employee or a
 
07:43:09.830 --> 07:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer but not to a sex offender who
 
07:43:12.150 --> 07:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
offers employment or volunteer service
 
07:43:15.030 --> 07:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
as an employer and secondly that
 
07:43:18.230 --> 07:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
landscaping was not the kind of work
 
07:43:20.468 --> 07:43:20.478 align:start position:0%
that fell within the statute because it
 
07:43:22.788 --> 07:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
was unlike teaching coaching boy scout
 
07:43:24.310 --> 07:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
leader etc
 
07:43:26.948 --> 07:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
the court unanimously agreed
 
07:43:28.548 --> 07:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
with the with the defendant on the
 
07:43:31.190 --> 07:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
second issue and reversed his conviction
 
07:43:33.030 --> 07:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
but said that the legislature could
 
07:43:35.830 --> 07:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
change the law if it wanted to
 
07:43:38.708 --> 07:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was just adopted uh
 
07:43:40.948 --> 07:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
by the prior vote
 
07:43:42.868 --> 07:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
it does just that
 
07:43:45.110 --> 07:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
and it does so by prohibiting a sex
 
07:43:46.868 --> 07:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
offender from and now i'm quite it
 
07:43:49.110 --> 07:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
removes all the specific language about
 
07:43:51.910 --> 07:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
teacher and boy scout leader etc
 
07:43:54.230 --> 07:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it replaces with is it replaces it
 
07:43:57.590 --> 07:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this language quote from a
 
07:43:59.270 --> 07:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
sex offender is prohibited from
 
07:44:02.628 --> 07:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
providing any employment or volunteer
 
07:44:05.110 --> 07:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
activity that provides direct services
 
07:44:08.150 --> 07:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
to minors or supervision or oversight of
 
07:44:10.070 --> 07:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
minors close quote
 
07:44:11.910 --> 07:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
my problem with this amendment is that
 
07:44:13.910 --> 07:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
it goes too far
 
07:44:15.510 --> 07:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
under this amendment
 
07:44:17.750 --> 07:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
a convicted sex offender
 
07:44:20.230 --> 07:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
would not be able to get a job as a
 
07:44:23.030 --> 07:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
checkout person at market basket or
 
07:44:25.830 --> 07:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
cumberland farms or as a waiter at a
 
07:44:27.830 --> 07:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant because in each of these
 
07:44:29.990 --> 07:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
settings the sex offender might have
 
07:44:32.868 --> 07:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
occasion to provide direct services to a
 
07:44:32.878 --> 07:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
occasion to provide direct services to a
minor

07:44:35.030 --> 07:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
minor
 
07:44:37.750 --> 07:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
virtually all sex offenders will
 
07:44:40.628 --> 07:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
eventually really be really uh released
 
07:44:43.830 --> 07:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
from jail the question we have to decide
 
07:44:45.190 --> 07:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
is whether we want to make the
 
07:44:48.310 --> 07:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition so restrictive that we
 
07:44:50.708 --> 07:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
effectively prohibit sex offenders from
 
07:44:53.430 --> 07:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
getting any kinds of jobs that may
 
07:44:56.310 --> 07:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably be available to them they're
 
07:44:57.830 --> 07:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
not likely to be
 
07:45:00.310 --> 07:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know interviewed for the next uh
 
07:45:03.910 --> 07:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
chairmanship of b of uh bae systems
 
07:45:05.750 --> 07:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
these are the kind of jobs that market
 
07:45:07.830 --> 07:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
basket incumbent farms and other places
 
07:45:09.750 --> 07:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
like that that are likely to be to be
 
07:45:12.388 --> 07:45:12.398 align:start position:0%
only ones available to them
 
07:45:15.510 --> 07:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
if we do want to make the restriction
 
07:45:16.948 --> 07:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
if we do want to make the law that
 
07:45:19.830 --> 07:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
restrictive and we effectively guaran we
 
07:45:21.990 --> 07:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
effectively guarantee that they will
 
07:45:24.548 --> 07:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
spend their life on welfare and you and
 
07:45:26.948 --> 07:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
i and our constituents will end up
 
07:45:28.388 --> 07:45:28.398 align:start position:0%
paying for it
 
07:45:30.548 --> 07:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
the the proposed amendment that i have
 
07:45:30.558 --> 07:45:32.628 align:start position:0%
the the proposed amendment that i have
offered

07:45:32.628 --> 07:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
offered
 
07:45:35.510 --> 07:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
avoids this problem by narrowing the
 
07:45:38.310 --> 07:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
statute so that it retains the listing
 
07:45:40.310 --> 07:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
of the specific types of prohibited
 
07:45:42.548 --> 07:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
employment or volunteer service in the
 
07:45:45.830 --> 07:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
current law but also adds language
 
07:45:47.830 --> 07:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
prohibiting employment or volunteer
 
07:45:49.670 --> 07:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
service that quote
 
07:45:52.150 --> 07:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
requires the person to have regular
 
07:45:55.830 --> 07:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
contact with or supervision of a minor
 
07:45:59.110 --> 07:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
when other persons are not present
 
07:46:01.510 --> 07:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
this and that quote close quote this
 
07:46:03.670 --> 07:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
would not prohibit working as a grocery
 
07:46:06.468 --> 07:46:06.478 align:start position:0%
or convenience store or at a restaurant
 
07:46:08.388 --> 07:46:08.398 align:start position:0%
because normally such work occurs in a
 
07:46:10.628 --> 07:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
public setting where other people are
 
07:46:12.868 --> 07:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
around and therefore the sex offender
 
07:46:14.468 --> 07:46:14.478 align:start position:0%
has little or no opportunity to take
 
07:46:16.310 --> 07:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
advantage of a minor
 
07:46:18.708 --> 07:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
the language of my proposed amendment
 
07:46:20.868 --> 07:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
also is worded so that it covers both
 
07:46:23.110 --> 07:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
the sex offender who is seeking
 
07:46:25.670 --> 07:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
employment and one who offers an
 
07:46:25.680 --> 07:46:27.190 align:start position:0%
employment and one who offers an
employment

07:46:27.190 --> 07:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
employment
 
07:46:28.388 --> 07:46:28.398 align:start position:0%
as an employer
 
07:46:29.990 --> 07:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
i urge you
 
07:46:33.590 --> 07:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
to approve to vote uh
 
07:46:36.230 --> 07:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this uh proposed
 
07:46:38.388 --> 07:46:38.398 align:start position:0%
amendment and then i would and then if
 
07:46:40.230 --> 07:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you do i would also hope you will
 
07:46:43.510 --> 07:46:43.520 align:start position:0%

07:46:53.030 --> 07:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:55.350 --> 07:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:46:59.670 --> 07:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
was filed and had a committee hearing
 
07:47:01.990 --> 07:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
and there certainly were issues
 
07:47:02.000 --> 07:47:03.430 align:start position:0%
and there certainly were issues
identified

07:47:03.430 --> 07:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
identified
 
07:47:05.910 --> 07:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the original bill
 
07:47:09.430 --> 07:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
that it was too broad in scope and a
 
07:47:13.110 --> 07:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was formed and worked very
 
07:47:16.548 --> 07:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
very diligently to come up with the
 
07:47:19.830 --> 07:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
language that we have
 
07:47:22.310 --> 07:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
i do not agree with the representative
 
07:47:26.230 --> 07:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
that just spoke the language that we
 
07:47:29.190 --> 07:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
passed earlier uh well i'm sorry that
 
07:47:32.708 --> 07:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:36.708 --> 07:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:39.670 --> 07:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
is for direct supervision
 
07:47:43.830 --> 07:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
or close proximity working with
 
07:47:43.840 --> 07:47:45.590 align:start position:0%
or close proximity working with
miners

07:47:45.590 --> 07:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
miners
 
07:47:45.600 --> 07:47:47.430 align:start position:0%
miners
so

07:47:47.430 --> 07:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:47:49.830 --> 07:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with the previous speaker
 
07:47:53.430 --> 07:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will allow you to have some of
 
07:47:55.190 --> 07:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
those jobs
 
07:47:57.868 --> 07:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
but you can't be
 
07:48:01.430 --> 07:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
supervising or in direct
 
07:48:02.310 --> 07:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:48:02.320 --> 07:48:03.510 align:start position:0%
you know
management

07:48:03.510 --> 07:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
management
 
07:48:05.750 --> 07:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
over minors
 
07:48:08.070 --> 07:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:48:11.430 --> 07:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
as it appears on the consent calendar
 
07:48:14.230 --> 07:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
came out of the the committee i believe
 
07:48:18.830 --> 07:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
it was 19 to 1. it was a bipartisan
 
07:48:22.230 --> 07:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
amendment we had another issue
 
07:48:25.590 --> 07:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
also unfortunately out of deerfield
 
07:48:28.468 --> 07:48:28.478 align:start position:0%
with carnival ride operators that are
 
07:48:31.468 --> 07:48:31.478 align:start position:0%
registered as sex lenders working
 
07:48:35.350 --> 07:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
unsupervised with children all day long
 
07:48:38.310 --> 07:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
and the original intent of a law was to
 
07:48:40.948 --> 07:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
not allow that to happen
 
07:48:43.270 --> 07:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
and the courts found the flaw in the
 
07:48:46.548 --> 07:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
language and we worked very diligently
 
07:48:50.070 --> 07:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
to close that loophole
 
07:48:53.670 --> 07:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does not only protect
 
07:48:53.680 --> 07:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
this bill does not only protect
miners

07:48:56.230 --> 07:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
miners
 
07:48:59.350 --> 07:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
but this bill also protects registered
 
07:49:02.788 --> 07:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
sex offenders because that particular
 
07:49:07.030 --> 07:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
crime has a very high recidivism rate
 
07:49:08.190 --> 07:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
and by
 
07:49:08.200 --> 07:49:09.990 align:start position:0%
and by
disallowing

07:49:09.990 --> 07:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
disallowing
 
07:49:12.548 --> 07:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders into an
 
07:49:15.590 --> 07:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
environment where they are more likely
 
07:49:19.030 --> 07:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
to reoffend protects the registered sex
 
07:49:22.070 --> 07:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
offender as well as the minor children
 
07:49:26.150 --> 07:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:28.150 --> 07:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
i would request
 
07:49:32.948 --> 07:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
that this body not adopt this amendment
 
07:49:35.990 --> 07:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that we pass the amendment and the
 
07:49:39.510 --> 07:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill as found on the consent
 
07:49:39.520 --> 07:49:40.788 align:start position:0%
bill as found on the consent
calendar

07:49:40.788 --> 07:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
07:49:42.948 --> 07:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion in the
 
07:49:46.468 --> 07:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about how limiting
 
07:49:49.830 --> 07:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
this particular bill would be to
 
07:49:52.788 --> 07:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders and that's why
 
07:49:56.150 --> 07:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
so much time was spent on the language
 
07:49:56.160 --> 07:49:56.830 align:start position:0%
so much time was spent on the language
to

07:49:56.830 --> 07:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:50:00.150 --> 07:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that it wasn't so limiting in
 
07:50:02.628 --> 07:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
scope that registered sex offenders
 
07:50:05.270 --> 07:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
could not find work to support
 
07:50:08.310 --> 07:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families but also
 
07:50:10.310 --> 07:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
protect minors
 
07:50:12.948 --> 07:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this amendment
 
07:50:15.430 --> 07:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
is a step backwards
 
07:50:17.030 --> 07:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to have to come
 
07:50:18.868 --> 07:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
back at it again
 
07:50:21.510 --> 07:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the trigger for coming back at it
 
07:50:24.468 --> 07:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
again is going to be in a minor that has
 
07:50:27.990 --> 07:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
been abused and there we have served no
 
07:50:28.000 --> 07:50:29.590 align:start position:0%
been abused and there we have served no
one

07:50:29.590 --> 07:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:50:31.750 --> 07:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
07:50:34.628 --> 07:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
they can't they can work with minors as
 
07:50:36.868 --> 07:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
long as they're not alone
 
07:50:41.510 --> 07:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
you can't guarantee that things happen
 
07:50:44.230 --> 07:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
emergencies pop up and somebody has to
 
07:50:46.708 --> 07:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
leave quickly and now we have the
 
07:50:48.788 --> 07:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
potential of that registered sex
 
07:50:51.670 --> 07:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
offender working in close proximity with
 
07:50:54.948 --> 07:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
minors unsupervised you can't guarantee
 
07:50:54.958 --> 07:50:57.030 align:start position:0%
minors unsupervised you can't guarantee
it

07:50:57.030 --> 07:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:51:00.868 --> 07:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
i begged this body to please reject this
 
07:51:04.388 --> 07:51:04.398 align:start position:0%
amendment and let us pass the bipartisan
 
07:51:06.388 --> 07:51:06.398 align:start position:0%
amendment that came out of the
 
07:51:08.708 --> 07:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and out of the committee
 
07:51:11.430 --> 07:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
with a nineteen to one vote
 
07:51:14.230 --> 07:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:16.868 --> 07:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the adoption
 
07:51:16.878 --> 07:51:19.190 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the adoption
bigger

07:51:19.190 --> 07:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
07:51:21.990 --> 07:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
will the remember we yield to a question
 
07:51:24.868 --> 07:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
will remember yield to a question
 
07:51:27.350 --> 07:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes remember yields you may inquire
 
07:51:29.110 --> 07:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you for
 
07:51:30.708 --> 07:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:51:30.718 --> 07:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

07:51:33.190 --> 07:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:34.830 --> 07:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
i read this it says
 
07:51:37.670 --> 07:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
that the prohibition of
 
07:51:39.270 --> 07:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
direct anything that has direct
 
07:51:44.468 --> 07:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:46.628 --> 07:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me
 
07:51:49.110 --> 07:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
or what's the difference how that
 
07:51:51.350 --> 07:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude
 
07:51:53.030 --> 07:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the types of things
 
07:51:54.388 --> 07:51:54.398 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:51:56.708 --> 07:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
lynn amendment addresses
 
07:51:58.628 --> 07:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that this would
 
07:52:00.868 --> 07:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
record anybody from say working in a
 
07:52:04.150 --> 07:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
grocery store or working at mcdonald's
 
07:52:07.350 --> 07:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
so i thank the member for the question
 
07:52:09.830 --> 07:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
and all i can tell you is what the
 
07:52:11.750 --> 07:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
experts told me
 
07:52:13.990 --> 07:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
so we had people
 
07:52:17.030 --> 07:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
from judiciary we had people from
 
07:52:20.070 --> 07:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and we had advocates
 
07:52:23.190 --> 07:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
that work with registered sex offenders
 
07:52:25.910 --> 07:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we all worked on this language
 
07:52:29.750 --> 07:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
together we all agreed on this language
 
07:52:34.548 --> 07:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
there was no party from any side of this
 
07:52:34.558 --> 07:52:35.670 align:start position:0%
there was no party from any side of this
issue

07:52:35.670 --> 07:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
07:52:37.990 --> 07:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
that didn't sign off on the language
 
07:52:40.388 --> 07:52:40.398 align:start position:0%
that's in the consent calendar
 
07:52:43.590 --> 07:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
there is no need for further amendment
 
07:52:46.548 --> 07:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
from what the committee done we trust
 
07:52:49.350 --> 07:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
our committees to to to do the work to
 
07:52:51.750 --> 07:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
do the right work i believe they did
 
07:52:54.468 --> 07:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
that and so i'd ask you to reject the uh
 
07:52:56.070 --> 07:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you
 
07:52:58.388 --> 07:52:58.398 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the lin floor
 
07:53:02.548 --> 07:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:05.430 --> 07:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
07:53:08.948 --> 07:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye
 
07:53:23.110 --> 07:53:23.120 align:start position:0%

07:53:29.990 --> 07:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
07:53:32.948 --> 07:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
put the hammer down quick enough i guess
 
07:53:34.868 --> 07:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
the division has been requested members
 
07:53:41.270 --> 07:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:42.948 --> 07:53:42.958 align:start position:0%

following resolution
 
07:59:17.830 --> 07:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
that it is supposed to be it was printed
 
07:59:20.868 --> 07:59:20.878 align:start position:0%

committee
 
07:59:34.388 --> 07:59:34.398 align:start position:0%
apparently the calendar the journal says
 
07:59:37.350 --> 07:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
that it was in itl
 
07:59:38.948 --> 07:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
and actually it was a it was supposed to
 
07:59:40.788 --> 07:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
be referred for interim study
 
07:59:42.230 --> 07:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore it was taken off the
 
07:59:44.388 --> 07:59:44.398 align:start position:0%
consent calendar i believe by a member
 
07:59:47.910 --> 07:59:47.920 align:start position:0%

08:04:53.670 --> 08:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
much needed regulations and limits for
 
08:04:56.310 --> 08:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
the use of personal delivery devices and
 
08:04:59.190 --> 08:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
mobile carriers you can all see them on
 
08:05:01.510 --> 08:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
the internet if you want to look at the
 
08:05:03.030 --> 08:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
internet you'll see what we're talking
 
08:05:03.040 --> 08:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
internet you'll see what we're talking
about

08:05:03.910 --> 08:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
08:05:07.110 --> 08:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
and what these vehicles look like
 
08:05:09.190 --> 08:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
i ask that this bill be removed from the
 
08:05:11.830 --> 08:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
consent calendar because when i read the
 
08:05:11.840 --> 08:05:12.628 align:start position:0%
consent calendar because when i read the
bill

08:05:12.628 --> 08:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
08:05:15.350 --> 08:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the article i was concerned that in
 
08:05:17.030 --> 08:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
08:05:20.388 --> 08:05:20.398 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me to be an accommodation
 
08:05:22.468 --> 08:05:22.478 align:start position:0%
for what is being set forward by the
 
08:05:25.430 --> 08:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
delivery industry
 
08:05:27.110 --> 08:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this
 
08:05:29.750 --> 08:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill allows vehicles that weigh up to 80
 
08:05:32.070 --> 08:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
pounds plus their cargo
 
08:05:35.190 --> 08:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
to travel at speeds up to 10
 
08:05:38.548 --> 08:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
to 12 and a half miles up on sidewalks
 
08:05:41.510 --> 08:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
roadways crosswalks
 
08:05:44.150 --> 08:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be more concerned with the
 
08:05:44.160 --> 08:05:45.190 align:start position:0%
we need to be more concerned with the
safety

08:05:45.190 --> 08:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
safety
 
08:05:47.750 --> 08:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
on our roads and our
 
08:05:50.388 --> 08:05:50.398 align:start position:0%
pedestrians than this
 
08:05:53.350 --> 08:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
as a selectmen i also was concerned with
 
08:05:55.750 --> 08:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
the lack of local control
 
08:05:55.760 --> 08:05:56.548 align:start position:0%
the lack of local control
this

08:05:56.548 --> 08:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
08:06:00.150 --> 08:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
bill states in part a local authority
 
08:06:03.830 --> 08:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
may not ban these delivery
 
08:06:05.510 --> 08:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
08:06:07.670 --> 08:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
i think we will be better served to vote
 
08:06:09.830 --> 08:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
no on ought to pass
 
08:06:15.270 --> 08:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:17.030 --> 08:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
08:06:19.110 --> 08:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
stephen smith speak in favor of the
 
08:06:22.468 --> 08:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:24.150 --> 08:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:06:25.750 --> 08:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
the reason it's important to pass this
 
08:06:28.548 --> 08:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
bill is because in the absence of it
 
08:06:30.388 --> 08:06:30.398 align:start position:0%
there are no regulations matter of fact
 
08:06:31.590 --> 08:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're being tested on the roads and
 
08:06:33.350 --> 08:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
sidewalks right now we had one rolling
 
08:06:35.990 --> 08:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
around out in front of the state house
 
08:06:38.230 --> 08:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
who contributed to this bill the
 
08:06:40.788 --> 08:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturers the industry the operators
 
08:06:42.708 --> 08:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
and the department of safety
 
08:06:44.948 --> 08:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to study it more we did
 
08:06:46.388 --> 08:06:46.398 align:start position:0%
that this summer
 
08:06:48.628 --> 08:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
and got all that input together the
 
08:06:50.310 --> 08:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
weights and speeds that you find in the
 
08:06:52.868 --> 08:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill are what they use
 
08:06:55.110 --> 08:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
we'll establish those parameters most
 
08:06:57.910 --> 08:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
importantly we establish liability
 
08:06:59.670 --> 08:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
levels and require them to carry
 
08:07:01.830 --> 08:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
insurance right now
 
08:07:03.110 --> 08:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
they can run around the streets of
 
08:07:05.510 --> 08:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
manchester without that
 
08:07:06.788 --> 08:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
so it's there's generally a
 
08:07:08.468 --> 08:07:08.478 align:start position:0%
misconception that without these
 
08:07:10.548 --> 08:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
regulatory packages
 
08:07:13.590 --> 08:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
they can't go well they can they are and
 
08:07:15.670 --> 08:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's important for us to get ahead of it
 
08:07:17.350 --> 08:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
so please support the unanimous
 
08:07:19.350 --> 08:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
transportation committee report of

uh diane schuett at b2
 
08:20:43.030 --> 08:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
i would just point out to the body that
 
08:20:45.430 --> 08:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
by the numbers it's obvious that
 
08:20:47.590 --> 08:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
consent for the previous speaker to
 
08:20:50.468 --> 08:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
continue was bipartisan and i would hope
 
08:20:53.110 --> 08:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
that that spirit will continue for
 
08:21:00.070 --> 08:21:00.080 align:start position:0%

last objection that this will be a
 
08:21:48.070 --> 08:21:48.080 align:start position:0%

08:21:50.150 --> 08:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
that and i didn't take a roll call last

thank you mr chair i feel a little
 
08:24:42.948 --> 08:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
awkward after that
 
08:24:45.590 --> 08:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm uh disappointed that folks weren't
 
08:24:45.600 --> 08:24:46.548 align:start position:0%
i'm uh disappointed that folks weren't
willing

08:24:46.548 --> 08:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
willing
 
08:24:48.548 --> 08:24:48.558 align:start position:0%
at least a number of folks
 
08:24:49.990 --> 08:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
to listen to
 
08:24:52.788 --> 08:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
my in my state rep
 
08:24:55.830 --> 08:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
um so it's very awkward to transition
 
08:24:58.548 --> 08:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
from that to what i was gonna say but i
 
08:25:00.788 --> 08:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
am also inspired even though i disagreed
 
08:25:02.628 --> 08:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
with viewpoints as the daughter of a

and the reading of the names of those
 
08:25:13.190 --> 08:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
who perished i just want to thank him
 
08:25:14.708 --> 08:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
for that
 
08:25:16.548 --> 08:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
so i just made my transition even more
 
08:25:17.910 --> 08:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
awkward but
 
08:25:20.388 --> 08:25:20.398 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to talk about briefly
 
08:25:22.468 --> 08:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
and i've heard mention of catholics
 
08:25:24.708 --> 08:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
multiple times from our colleagues
 
08:25:26.948 --> 08:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
across the aisle for what it's worth i'm
 
08:25:28.948 --> 08:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
a devout catholic so i'm going to throw
 
08:25:31.110 --> 08:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
a hail mary
 
08:25:31.120 --> 08:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
a hail mary
um

08:25:33.030 --> 08:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:25:34.628 --> 08:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
we did not get to vote on the minimum

wage bill
 
08:25:38.150 --> 08:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
and you know i didn't expect to win
 
08:25:40.548 --> 08:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily but i want to extend an

the wage crisis the employee crisis
 
08:25:52.388 --> 08:25:52.398 align:start position:0%
we have to acknowledge the fact
 
08:25:54.388 --> 08:25:54.398 align:start position:0%
even if we wouldn't go about it the same
 
08:25:54.398 --> 08:25:55.350 align:start position:0%
even if we wouldn't go about it the same
way

the free markets in new hampshire

suffers because of that
 
08:26:33.590 --> 08:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
i would also like to point out
 
08:26:36.468 --> 08:26:36.478 align:start position:0%
that because a hundred and over

an hour in this state
 
08:26:49.110 --> 08:26:49.120 align:start position:0%

08:26:57.030 --> 08:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
that it means
 
08:26:59.030 --> 08:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
we as taxpayers
 
08:27:00.948 --> 08:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
are paying
 
08:27:02.070 --> 08:27:02.080 align:start position:0%

as free market capitalists why would we

as free market capitalists why would we
subsidize

08:27:13.990 --> 08:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
subsidize
 
08:27:16.628 --> 08:27:16.638 align:start position:0%

paying
 
08:27:20.388 --> 08:27:20.398 align:start position:0%
because if just a few dollars an hour
 
08:27:23.510 --> 08:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
they would not need public assistance
 
08:27:26.548 --> 08:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
