62 and invite chairman Roy
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
to introduce his legislation good
 
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
morning thank you madam chairman and
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
Roy Rockingham
 
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
32 House Bill 62 was introduced by me at
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
the request of the Department of Defense
 
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
it is part of a program the Department
 
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 align:start position:0%
of Defense is carrying out Nationwide to
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
better um work with the states on
 
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 align:start position:0%
various issues related to military
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
members and family members this is one
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
of them where this has to do with um
 
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 align:start position:0%
protective orders where it is now
 
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
currently a protective order can be
 
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
issued by a military commander to any
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
service member however that protective
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
order is only good on base so once they
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
leave the military property the
 
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
protective order is no longer in effect
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it works it
 
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
into our system so it can be recognized
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
and used as evidence in the issuance of
 
00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
a civilian protective order so that the
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
protection doesn't just stop at the
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
gates of the of the
 
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
base um as part of this program that the
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
military does they rank States on
 
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
friendliness to the military um how good
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
we treat the service members their
 
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
families and things of this nature and
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
you may wonder why that's important well
 
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to if some of you may be
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
old enough to remember back the the base
 
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
closings during President Clinton's time
 
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to close bases they
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
look at which states are friendliest to
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
the service and service members the
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ranks number one or very close
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
to it as far as being a good place to
 
00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
serve and families to live we want to
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
keep it that way and our part of a great
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
part of our economy is um based around
 
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
the military we have many military
 
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
contractors we have military bases some
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
some of them are very key and strategic
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
so I I want us to work hand in glove
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the military to continue to be good
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
neighbors and friends um I'll take
 
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions but there are experts on the
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
matter behind me who will be testifying
 
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.230 align:start position:0%
matter behind me who will be testifying
thank

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative um
 
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
representative Muse question question I
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
on the um on what actually happens to a
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
military protective order would the bill
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at would that
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually make that order enforcable
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the base or is there some
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
other mechanism in place um it's my
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
understanding what will happen is that
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
order will be used to get a civilian
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
order the military we can't
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
automatically just grant um that power
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
because the way the military Works um is
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
much different under the uniform Court
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
of military Justice you don't get to as
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
a soldier you don't get to say well I
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
want to oppose that order sir um that
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't go very far so thank you
 
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
leles thank you for taking my question
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
um being a Navy veteran there was always
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh Navy housing that surrounded
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
bases and I'm just wondering uh based
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
upon your testimony of uh protective
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
orders only being applicable on base uh
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
I would think that Navy housing if there
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
was to be domestic violence it would
 
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
occur in Navy housing could you tell me
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
uh what the current state of of uh the
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
law is and with this bill how that would
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
change it sure um and keep in mind
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
everything I say is subject to be
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
corrected by the people behind me um I
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
believe if the military owns that
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
housing then that order would then be in
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
effect if it's just rented by military
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
members I do not believe it would be so
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
what would happen is the the um
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
plaintiff would take her military order
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
or his military order go to our court
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
and show them that and then request a
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
civilian order that would then be good
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
outside the
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
thanks any further questions seeing none
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman Roy thank
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
you I apologize but I cannot read this
 
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.710 align:start position:0%
you I apologize but I cannot read this
but

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
Nicole and it's not your fault I
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't read it I and fairness I have
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
thing okay so um if if you could go
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
ahead and give that to representative
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
sheer um what we would ask is if you
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
have written testimony you're passing
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
that around we'll most likely read that
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
while you're giving your testimony if
 
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
you could just kind of give us the
 
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%

front of you you have my written
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and and basically I'm just
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
going to reiterate what representative
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
Roy has already mentioned which is
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
really this bill does two things number
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
one it
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
um it it basically allows for a military
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
protective order an Mo as we said say in
 
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
the military to um to be used as
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
evidence in a civilian proceeding should
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
a victim want to um get civilian
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
protective orders or uh restraining
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
order anything of that matter um on the
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
civilian side as representative Roy has
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
said the military protective order
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
really just
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
encompasses um activities within the
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
installation uh limits so it does not
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
carry out to um civilian communities so
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh so that's what it does and then
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
number two um the other thing that it
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
would do is the agitant general would be
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
able to reimburse travel funds for
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
victims who need to um travel to local
 
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
or civilian
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
proceedings so those two
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
things I'll take your questions
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
question is the military housing that
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
the military owns that is not on a base
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
itself sir we don't have any military
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
housing all of our national guard
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
members live within the civilian
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions all
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
right representative Muse
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
could you walk us through the language
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
requesting and and the rationale for
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
them good morning um as as our uh Deputy
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
ad stated I'm I'm uh the state Judge
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
Advocate I'm also my full-time job is as
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard general
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
Council um just for clarification um
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday we we had received um an
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
updated version from the Department of
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
Defense legislatively Aon which is what
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
um Miss uh Miss pix has handed out to
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
you all um and the changes are very
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
simple um and there really two changes
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is to uh for the
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
provision of the agin general to make
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
payments uh to reimburse for travel um
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
and the second one is that um a military
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
projective order will be admissible as
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
evidence in a proceeding there's no and
 
00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
it's it's really been truncated down to
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
a page and a half and it's very very
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward right I don't see any
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
question any further questions thank you
 
00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:42.269 align:start position:0%
question any further questions thank you

uh we're chartered by state RSA 115
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%

-8 you can also find us by going through
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
the dmabs website there's a a link to us
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and and what we do and we're made up of
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
20 member organizations and these member
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
organizations are veteran service
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
organizations in our state that should
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
be familiar to you names like the
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
American Legion the Veterans of Foreign
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
Wars uh all of the all of the different
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
Services have a an advocacy agency I
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
personally represent the air and space
 
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
forces Association formerly the Air
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
Force Association but now that we've
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
added space we've added that to our name
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
as well um and I'm also our legislative
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
chairman and so what happens is when
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
when we come up with our thousand plus
 
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh lsrs that are going to come before
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
you folks I look through and I decide
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
which ones have veteran impact and then
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
we have a meeting as we did last night
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and we discuss the language on them and
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
we decide whether we want to support
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
them or oppose them and then I come here
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I tell you what we've decided so we
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
do uh strongly support this bill uh
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
there's a list of 10 priorities from DOD
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
about military families this is this
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
runs right in there uh with uh that uh
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
that idea um and I will tell you just
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
personally um the highlight of my
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
professional life was when I became a FL
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
a squadron commander of a flying
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
Squadron and I always told my folks it's
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
not my job to do the mission it's my
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's your job to do the mission it's my
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
job to take care of you and your
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
families so I spend a lot of my time
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
working people problems and I think a
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
lot of good commanders sir Colonel
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
Bixler would tell you the same thing
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's what they view as their highest
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
priority and being in a military family
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
is stressful okay there's moves there's
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
deployments there's dealing with PTSD or
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
or medical issues that come back with
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
somebody who's potentially deployed and
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
protecting our families has got to be
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
right at the top of the list of what we
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
do it's sad when we have to issue a
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
military protective order but that
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
military protective order has got to
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
have some teeth with it you know it's
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
one thing to be in trouble on base it's
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
another thing to be able to take that
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
military protective order to a civilian
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
Court to help get a restraining order
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
for someone who lives off base as all of
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
our guard folks here in New Hampshire do
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
so we do support this legislation and
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's really
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
morning representative
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
lelis thank you for taking my question
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know whether my face is
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
familiar or not to you but your face is
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
familiar to me well that's good
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
sir um from one again I was a Navy
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
veteran submarine veteran and I can say
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
that it's hard for civilians to
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
understand what family separation does
 
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
understand what family separation does
to

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
relationships and when you're deployed
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what brand you're in
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
but when you're deployed and you come
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
back it's it's
 
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.269 align:start position:0%
back it's it's
extremely

00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.069 align:start position:0%
extremely
stressful

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
stressful
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
irrespective of any particular
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
casualties that you've had in your in
 
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.910 align:start position:0%
casualties that you've had in your in
your

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
deployment statistics show that young
 
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.710 align:start position:0%
deployment statistics show that young
service

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
people many times marriages do not
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
survive just from the stress of that
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
yes is it your testimony that we need to
 
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:10.519 align:start position:0%
take action when it comes to this sort
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
of thing I it's it's my testimony to you
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
that that I think that these incidents
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
of of especially where it gets to
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
domestic violence are relatively rare
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
but in those situations where that
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
happens our our highest duty is to
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
protect that that that military family
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
and if if that means issuing a military
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
protective order and using that
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
protective order to get a civilian
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
protective order because we don't have
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
our own base housing and things like
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
that where that that would carry a
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
little more weight than than we're in
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
Newman if a military member in the
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
National Guard in New Hampshire has one
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
of these protective orders against
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
someone who is either I don't know if it
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
makes a difference whether it's civilian
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
and Military
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
where would that order be in effect just
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
on what what kind of places like the
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
where where they have armories and stuff
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
like that any any property owned by
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
owned by the the the dod slth State
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
National Guard any property there that
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
would it would certainly apply while
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
they're there and in in another
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
circumstance and you have to understand
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
that that some of this is trying to get
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
common language in all the different
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
states and so like places that might
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
have housing uh on base where where
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
someone could live then the these things
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
would would carry more weight than they
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
do here in New Hampshire where um you
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
know that we don't have our our own
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
housing so it's hard it's hard for us
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
to control what happens when that person
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
leaves the base and goes home it will be
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
easier when this if this legislation
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
passes and this is used now my military
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
protective order that I would give say
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
as a commander would now be used in a
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
civilian uh civil court to get a
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
restraining order it would carry a
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
weight thank
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
you if I just may ask a question for for
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
clarity would this would this work both
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
both directions so if the if the
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrator was in the military and the
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
victim was not and then or vice versa if
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
if the victim was in the military but
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator was not would that not I
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
guess if the victim was a was in the
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
military never mind I answered my
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
question as I asked it okay thank you
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair I see it
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
Newman do it work on
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
civilian if you
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
I I think that Times Like These the
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
reason that we have jge judge Advocates
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
General and lawyers are to answer this
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
kind of question
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
so welcome back welcome back see there's
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
a reason for lawyers right exactly we'll
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
debate that later no I'm just kidding
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I'm in support I'm in full
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
record um for for clarity uh military
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
protective orders can only be issued
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
against offenders or perpetrators that
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
are military okay
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
okay so the offender has to be in the
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
military the victim it's irrelevant if
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
they are if they're not that's corre
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying representative
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
gather um do you know if this what
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
you're asking for New Hampshire to do is
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
in any other
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
state I I I don't know uh it may be in
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
the the dod liaison written testimony
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
that was sent to the committee chair um
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't have that printed out
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I could look at it on my
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
phone but it would take years to to look
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
through and find it but um I just still
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
thought I just thought that maybe in
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
your research or something you might
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
have came across that maybe mass is
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing or New York or
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere so just ask I don't no problem
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
again you let me let me
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
um uh when when we're done here I will
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
email the the dod liaison officer and
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
ask her to provide the committee with
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
with that answer thank you thank you
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you they could they
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
could actually email the entire
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
committee that answer thank you very
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
much we also could we we have a
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
committee researcher that would be able
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
to help us if you guys weren't able to
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
to find it quickly okay all right Cena
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
rep representative Mur Murphy thank you
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just um
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
two related questions if I could um I
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to know the financial assistance
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's uh referenced in the um in this
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill is it just for victims if the
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
victims are military or is that for any
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
victim if the perpetrator that is I
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
think that's intended for victims who
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
are not military I think it's intended
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
for family members but any Vic any
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
victim okay and may follow up follow
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um and the second question is
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
um who are those funds issued from and
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
you if somebody could answer that thank
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
you we have other people testifying I'm
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
sure that they will get them col Bixler
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
may may have an idea where that comes
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
from from a money
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint so the money would be paid
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
out of our state general funds for davs
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
for the Department of military Affairs
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
and veteran
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
services thank you okay thank you very
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
much I don't see any more questions
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook run okay thanks very
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair thanks for the assist
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
Andre members I have a feeling we might
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
answered he was trained well thank you
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
um my name is Stephen Anders I'm an
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney of marac
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
County I do support this legislation we
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
met a number of times you either this
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
summer or this fall and sort of went
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
over each section of it and hammered it
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
out and I think that at this point what
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment represents sort of the
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
best of what we came up with so I do
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
support it and I'm happy to answer
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
questions could you just Enlighten us
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
were there any questions that were asked
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
of the of the prior of the of the our
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
prior guests that maybe you could
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
clarify or no the only thing I would say
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
is that with reference to military
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
protective orders being admissible at
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
civil protective order hearings I don't
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
know that that actually changes anything
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
because under the current civil
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
protective order hearing rules The Rules
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
of Evidence don't apply so I think
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an argument that at
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
this point under the current rules you
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
could bring a military protective order
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
into one of those hearings um as
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
evidence this just clarifies that in
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
fact you can do that okay very good
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
rep representative
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so it looks to me
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
like this is very specific in that it
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
can be used in evidence in um civilian
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
protective orders um which makes sense I
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could speak a
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about um can this be used as
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
evidence in other um you know other
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
trials and other you know if it went
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
beyond that for
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
example is that already existing it
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably it probably wouldn't be able
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in terms of like to get a
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
civilian protective order certainly it
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
could be used I think it could be used
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
to get for example a stalking order if
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
that were an issue because again The
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence don't necessarily
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
apply to obtaining a stalking order if
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
there was a violation of a civil
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
protective order in a criminal trial I
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
think the existence of a military
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
protective order would probably be um
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
excluded from that trial as essentially
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the Rules of Evidence okay
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
kyg good morning members of the
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
committee um as you know I'm Pamela kyg

I am the public policy specialist at the
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence um we're here um in
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
strong support of the amendment um that
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
I know uh rep Roy mentioned and other
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
speakers have mentioned this morning um
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
as was shared uh we worked with the New
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
England re uh region liaison of the US
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense State liaison
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
office U Melissa wette um in the fall
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
and summer uh to review the legislative
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
proposal um she wasn't able to be here
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
today but you've met um some of her
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues um and so uh we worked with a
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
lot of different state collaborators on
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
this I would like to just highlight
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
there's also a member of local law
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement who is prepared to answer uh
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
some of the questions as well um and we
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
just really appreciate um that um the
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
National Guard and representative Roy
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
brought this forward um just to
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
reiterate um it's a very straightforward
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment to the bill um it's really
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
important that victims have access to
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
critical financial assistance um often
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
they experience Financial burdens when
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
participating in legal proceedings Um
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
this can include loss of housing Health
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
Care Child Care financial support and
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
other Ben benefits um so this uh
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
provision will help offset those costs
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
by allowing victims who engage in the
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
court process to be reimbursed um for
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
related travel expenses so very
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward and then um secondly
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
with the military protective order
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
definition being added to RSA
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
173b again this is just very helpful um
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
to help bridge the gap really between
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
both the civilian and the military um
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
area when it comes to protecting victims
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
um everyone in the state who experiences
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence should have
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
protection and we just want to make sure
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
we um have the adequate tools and the
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
tool boxes to do that um but I
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
definitely would defer uh further
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions on the local jurisdiction
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of that to um Captain uh Clark in
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
um on HB 62 and I'm yeah thank you all

veteran thank you for this opportunity
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of House Bill 62 FN
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
specifically the proposed amendment to
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph 8 which seeks to make military
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
protective orders admissible as evidence
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
and not bound by the technical Rules of
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
Evidence in civilian Court proceedings
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire's domestic violence
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
statute approval of this bill with
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment will act to increase the
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
ability of Civilian New Hampshire law
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to keep parties
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
protected by these orders safer from
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
abuse additionally this bill will help
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
bridge the gap between military and
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
civilian Justice systems providing a
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive and cohesive approach
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
to safeguarding those at risk as
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
described in the bill a military
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
protective order is an order issued to a

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
commanding officer to maintain good
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
order and discipline and protect victims
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
from situations involving domestic

party despite the vast similarities
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
between the protective measures provided
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
by military protective orders and those
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
provided by CI civil domestic violence
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
and stocking protecting orders commonly
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
issued in the state violations of
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
military protective orders are
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
essentially unenforceable by New
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Law Enforcement Officers a
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
plausible scenario might involve a call
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
for service in which a civilian New
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police officer found a
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
defendant in a military protective order
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
to have been in contact with a protected
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
party who reported a domestic related
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
crime but there was insufficient
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
evidence to support a criminal complaint
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
a general practice of civilian police
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
officers is to avoid relying on evidence
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
during their investigations which they
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
believe might later be inadmissible in
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
court if this bill were to pass the
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge and confidence that military
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
protective orders are considered
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
admissible evidence would empower the
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
officers to use the contents of these
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
orders to support their investigations
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
potentially allowing them to
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
differentiate between an isolated
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
incident or a credible pattern of of
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
abuse unlike prosecutions of violations
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence or stocking
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
protective order cases in which the
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
issuing judge would not be called to
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
testify as a witness the non-judicial
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
nature of military protective orders
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
would likely require the issuing
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
commanding officer to appear in court
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
and testify in in an order they issued
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
if an order they issued was used to
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
support a criminal charge brought
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
forward by law enforcement this would be
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
equivalent to a civilian witness Who
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
provided the written or audio and video
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
recorded statement being subed to court
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
for their testimony while the best case
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
scenario would involve the commanding
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
officer being available to attend court
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the demanding nature of military service
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
often requires a military members to
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
travel frequently as they are deployed
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
to various locations around the country
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
and the globe thus hindering their
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
availability it is critical that we
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
remove this existing barrier that can
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
limit the protections afforded to
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
victims in our state if this bill were
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
to pass and courts were not bound by
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
technical Rules of Evidence when
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
considering the admissibility of
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
military protective orders this would
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
mitigate prosecut prosecutorial concern
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
ins in the likelihood that the issuing
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
commanding officer was deployed and
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
unavailable for court by allowing these
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
orders to be admissible without the need
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
of supporting testimony from the issuing
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
commanding officer this would reduce the
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
occurrence of lengthy lengthy
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
continuances while also lessening the
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
chances of a victim having to testify on
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
their own behalf in conclusion the
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to House Bill 62 will
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
allow the admissibility of military
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
protective orders in civilian courts
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
serving as a crucial step towards
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety and protection of
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
victims I'm grateful for the opportunity
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
to speak on behalf of the important this
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
important legislation and to advocate
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
for the rights and protections of all
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much um do you happen
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
to have a copy of your testimony because
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
you said a lot of things that I actually
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to write down but I didn't want
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
to stop give you my copy well thank you
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
very much I'll take you up on that uh
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative are you okay to answer a
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
few questions Captain representative
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
Shar um I'm I'm a little confused now uh
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Enders said these military
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
protective orders would not be
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
admissible in proceedings where the
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence applied they'd only be
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
admissible at proceedings like a a a
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
victim seeking a protective order in
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
that where the Rules of Evidence don't
 
00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:22.870 align:start position:0%
that where the Rules of Evidence don't
apply

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
so I may I may have misheard you but I
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
thought you said he suggested that we
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't want this will allow us to call
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
witnesses to to submit the
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
report in circumstances where otherwise
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
we'd have to wait to get the individual
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
there that would include criminal case
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
so let me simplify the question if I can
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
um is it your understanding that this uh
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
proposal would allow military protective
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
orders to be admissible at a criminal
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
trial I'm under that impression
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'm not
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
wrong uh yes okay I'm I'm under a
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
reading of that bill that it really is
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
meant so that people don't post no
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
hunting or trespassing on other people's
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
lands so as not to let Hunters go hunt
 
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.430 align:start position:0%
lands so as not to let Hunters go hunt
there

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a hunter myself I don't know
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
I mean I could conceive that somewhere
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
out there that behavior is probably
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
occurring but looking at this from a
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
private property rights perspective it
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
seems pretty cut and dry that folks who
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't if you don't own that land and
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
you're not authorized to post signs on
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
it you shouldn't be posting signs on
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
private property that's not
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
yours very good thank you um you don't
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
have to take any questions I just wanted
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
to see what you thought yeah that's fine
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
thanks anyone else want to testify in
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um seeing none I here by close

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the public hearing on House
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 102 and I invite the prime sponsor
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
to introduce his
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm happy to be
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
back with you today to introduce the
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
first of Two Bills of mine uh this bill
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
is substantially similar in concept to a
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill I brought last term however I very
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
much took the heart the various
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
criticisms that came from law
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement especially the sheriff's and
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
I removed all of what I believe were all
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
of the controversial
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh items that appeared in the bill to
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
really narrow down the scope of it to
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
just provide some measure of local
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
oversight for federal
 
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.189 align:start position:0%
oversight for federal
actions

01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
so it's quite simple sheriffs are the
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
top elected official for law enforcement
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
County they have a
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
direct low ratio to the people who elect
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
them and represent them
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
that provides
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
accountability historically in America
 
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
sheriffs would oversee federal law
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions that were being
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
undertaken in their
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
counties this makes a lot of sense given
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
the way that our government as a whole
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
was designed the founders didn't want to
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
put all of the power in any one person
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
or Branch they divided us into three
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
branches Federal uh rather sorry
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
executive judicial and legislative they
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
divided the legislative into by Camal
 
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:00.639 align:start position:0%
two branches they created a federalist
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
structure where there's a dual Sovereign
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
between the state and the federal
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
government so everybody has a bit of a
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
check on everyone else and sheriffs were
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
envisioned from the very beginning as
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
having a check on other law enforcement
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
to include federal law enforcement which
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
at the time was very minimal when the
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
when the nation was founded there wasn't
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
much more than Marshals it was very
 
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
minimal federal law enforcement cuz
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
laws so we've entered an age once again
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
where I believe it's important that we
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
emphasize this traditional role of
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
sheriffs in
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
America we too often recently have seen
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.070 align:start position:0%
federal law
enforcement

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
ignore best practices in pursuit of
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
ideological goals and media headlines
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
that's how we wind up with situations
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
where tactical deadly force entry is
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
utilized on elderly disabled
 
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
people instead of the accepted best
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
practice of patterning their life to
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
decide where is the safest place to
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
interdict and take a person into custody
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
that minimizes the risk of deadly force
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
application it's how we wind up with
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
full Federal tactical teams pointing
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
loaded rifles at the children of pastors
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
for nonviolent misdemeanor
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
offenses we've now seen large numbers of
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement placed on leave
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
or terminated under this new
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
Administration for malfeasant and for
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
political targeting of
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
dissidents while I very much hope we are
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
entering into a period of
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
reprieve we can't rest on our Laurels we
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
should provide a local elected law
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement Presence at federal police
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
actions in the state to observe and just
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
ensure that best practices are followed
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
respected and to answer a question
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
before it comes up because it was
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
brought to me a couple times does this
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
apply to ice because that's obviously a
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
big policy under the new Administration
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
as well my qu my answer to that would be
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
it would be discretionary cu the way
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is crafted is that it would
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
provide uh oversight for actions that
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
would be undertaken uh against New
 
01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
would be undertaken uh against New
Hampshire

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
residents and there is no legal um
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
mandate that a legal alien would be
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
considered a resident so it would be
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary uh at the sheriff's of
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
course discretion so with that I am
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
um okay a couple things for me the The
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
Ice question it would seem to me that
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to determine a
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
person's um status until an interdiction
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
actually happened so I don't know that
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
ice should be an exception um because
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
how do we know that that's not a citizen
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
or not until they propose some type of
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
action um second I'm confused by the the
 
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
maybe it's terminology maybe that's what
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
we need to look at yeah we call
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
oversight um if the sheriff if a sheriff
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
is accompanying for example um uh the
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
FBI on a on a an interdiction of some
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
type the sheriff can observe but he
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
really can't say hey you can't do that
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
hey you can't do this because they're
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
operating on a on a federal crime using
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
their Federal um rules and regulations
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
for their department or agency or
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
whatever whether we disagree with it or
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
not that would be something to be taken
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
up in court not between Law Enforcement
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
Officers out in the street so how do you
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that that
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
terminology thank you and that's a
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question because it
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
kind of speaks to the heart of what's
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
going on and the specific language that
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
I use where it's a it's a may not a
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
shall so historically um there have been
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
quite a few situations in the history of
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
the United States where local sheriffs
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
did at least temporarily halt the um
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
actions being taken by federal law
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement based on the principle that
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Sheriff is the
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
highest law enforcement officer in the
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
county and they have a check to be made
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
now that's one of those Concepts that
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
could go quite terrible depending on how
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's utilized so it really requires a
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
lot of discernment a lot of discretion
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
now I don't Envision many sheriffs
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to utilize that uh just
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly sort of but at the same time
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
I can Envision not under anything that's
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
even happened recently but I I could
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
Envision such a terrible circumstance
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
arising where
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
you have such out of control federal law
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement that are totally
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
disregarding rule of law and doing
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
things that are not right or just that
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
there may be a need to exercise that
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
kind of check not not from the court but
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
immediately on the spot to preserve life
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
and Limb and property of citizens of New
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's one of those areas
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a gray area but there is a
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
lot of historical precedent and I don't
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
think is something that any of our
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
sheriffs are liable to
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
abuse um as a followup how how would our
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
sheriffs be aware of pending or active
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
Federal investigations or actions in our
 
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
state um and and how could we force them
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
to tell us if if we don't know thank you
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
and that's another very good question
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
this is one of those areas again where
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
it it's a matter of you can put in
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
statute that the sheriff should require
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government to notify them of
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
actions taken does the federal
 
01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:53.070 align:start position:0%
actions taken does the federal
government

01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
comply May maybe maybe not but you only
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
have so much opportunity to check in
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of circumstance and checking
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be depend on the information
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
to receive now this is there's no
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism for that and
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't think there could be any
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism for that because
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's really more of a we're asking you
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
to play by these rules and if you don't
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
do it well there's not a whole lot we
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
can do about it but it's the way it
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
be finally for me
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
so you said there's historical precedent
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
and do you have historical cases that
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
that um any court cases at all that
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
where a sheriff was able to use any kind
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
of interdiction against the federal
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
government I don't care how old it is it
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
did it as it happened thank you I would
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to do a bit of research and see
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
if I can provide any court cases I don't
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
know that because what we're talking
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
about here is actually on the spot
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
immediate action being taken by law
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement without Court involvement so
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
whether there would be court cases
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
that specifically outline that I don't
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
know I'd be happy to provide cases where
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
the sheriffs did take measures to stop
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
something and I will look for any Court
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
presidents yeah definitely because as
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
far as I know right now the current
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
situation is federal takes precedent
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
over State and that's generally what
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
happens they come in if if there's two
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
crimes and it's for example um if
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's um a kidnapping it may be a
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
state charge and it's also a federal
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
charge the feds can exercise
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction just take it and that's the
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
way it is um but yeah if you have
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
research I'd be happy to hear it um
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative share uh the
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
best are you aware of the circumstance
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
during the Civil Rights era where the
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
federal government uh federal law
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers um uh came into
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
southern states to enforce federal law
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
sheriffs I am vaguely aware of the the
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances where in some cases
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
National Guard and FBI and Marshals
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
especially were utilized to do things
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
that were being opposed by States and
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's really a good example of the
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
check that I was talking about but in
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction because there's a
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
check going up to the federal level is
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
also a check from the federal level
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
going down to the state level especially
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
under the 14th Amendment to for equal
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
you representative n thank you Mr
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
so I uh I'm looking at kind of what the
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
what this would actually entail for
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
sheriffs because you know it says that
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
they would have a nonparticipating the
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh sheriff's deputies shall have a
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
non-participating presence in addition
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
to participatory so essentially what
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
this says to me is that they are
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
expected to be at any and all uh at
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
least in a nonparticipating capacity to
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
be at any and all uh Federal action in
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
our state um and so I'm wondering about
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
you know if you have any statistics um
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
around how often that happens not only
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
because that would be a heavy lift for
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's office but it would also
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
be a heavy lift on behalf of our
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
counties to to fund that extra
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
presence thank you for the question uh
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes there would be a increase in Need
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
for some Personnel in some cases I don't
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
think that would be a dramatic increase
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
first of all the rate at which these
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
Federal actions are happening is not the
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
same as the rate at which state level
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
actions are happening within the county
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
there's it's not happening as much uh
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
beyond that often times you're going to
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
find that local law enforcement
 
01:29:31.109 --> 01:29:31.119 align:start position:0%
including sheriffs will already have a
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
presence at a lot of these things even
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
though it's usually a participatory
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
presence uh so what this would do would
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
be to perhaps reevaluate that concept
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
and say well do we want to have a
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
participatory presence and also a
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
non-participatory presence or just a
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
non-participatory presence there um
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important to have
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
that oversight somebody who's not
 
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
directly and actively involved in the
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
act action to exercise a uh sort of
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
objective and non tainted Judgment of
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
the circumstances can I follow up real
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
quick follow up I just wanted to because
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I was thinking
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
about in order to kind of Envision
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what kind of lift it would be
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
you know and in expense is do you have
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
any statistics around how many actions
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
say on a an annual basis happen in New
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire corre thank you for the
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
question I don't have those statistics
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
in front of me I'd be happy to do a bit
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
of searching and see if I can find
 
01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
something I don't know how the easy it's
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to be to break out the differences
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
between I I suspect the overwhelming
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
majority are going to be ice or cpb
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
related which would be discretionary
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
under this um so I don't know if it
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
breaks it out so I can look at just FBI
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
ATF other actions but I'll try okay
 
01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.550 align:start position:0%
ATF other actions but I'll try okay
thank

01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
you you um you might want to look a call
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
to the US attorney for the District of
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire any law enforcement action
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
would have to go through their office so
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
they theoretically whether they would
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
tell you the time of day or not I don't
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
know but theoretically they would
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
collect that information I would think
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
um and it I think it is that represent
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
n's question was is very key to the the
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
matter as far as expense goes you you
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
did say though it's discretionary uh so
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
if the sheriff says okay they're just um
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
doing a simple war and I looked at it
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
this guy's a
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
felon do they have to go on that thank
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
you yes so the the the discretionary
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
aspect was regarding actions that would
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
be taken against non-citizens so it
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
would not be discretionary as far as
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
actions taken against citizens or as you
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
later earlier rather uh mentioned
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
unknowns if we're exercising an unknown
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
action then that would apply to that as
 
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
well but if for instance there was a
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
detainer or something for an uh illegal
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
immigrant it would not necessarily apply
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
it would be discretionary in that case
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
does the bill say the sheriff or his
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
design or just the
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
sheriff it
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
it is suggesting that it could be the
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
sheriff or the sheriff's deputies so he
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
could so he could send he or she could
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
send deputies not not necessarily be
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
their and there's no amount so they
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to send 10 one is fine
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you any further
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
01:32:14.109 --> 01:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
s thanks for taking my question are you
 
01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
um aware of any other states that have
 
01:32:17.119 --> 01:32:19.870 align:start position:0%
um aware of any other states that have
similar

01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for the question
 
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any other states that
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
have similar legislation such as this I
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
am aware of some other States including
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
Idaho and others that have
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
practices such as this in place where
 
01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
they try to accompany um Federal actions
 
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.270 align:start position:0%
they try to accompany um Federal actions
to

01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
observe representative
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
question um in uh line four you uh make
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
the following deletion the provision
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
visions of the Constitution of the
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
United States controlling in any and all
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
acts of Congress enacted in pursuance
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
thereof and I believe that this this
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
extradition and
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
says well could you just explain why
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
that was I believe we're going to the
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
next B replaced with I believe that's
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
the next bill we'll deal with it
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
noon okay see you no further questions
 
01:33:19.639 --> 01:33:22.189 align:start position:0%
noon okay see you no further questions
thank

01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
you um the chair
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
Oran I'm concerned uh are we speaking to
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
hb12 that was one I put in the cardboard
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay cool thanks I was afraid maybe
 
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
you're doing the other on so these um I
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
don't have a whole lot um I don't want
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
to go into a whole lots of detail about
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
this but um the county this um the
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
county sheriffs have fairly limited
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
powers and I guess we are adding a power
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
to it and there's probably there's a
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
good idea behind it but I think this is
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
something to be more appropriately uh
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General should be
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
doing of the state the um and they um I
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
believe they're already doing all this
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh things and the I think there's a
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the title Sheriff
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
so we call we have uh 10 subdivisions in
 
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
our state called counties and each
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
county has a sheriff I think they were
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
originally um also I think the court
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
clerk as well as a law enforcement
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
officer but you know the English civil
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
law you know what it says about sheriffs
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
U it doesn't necessarily apply to these
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
officials they basically just have the
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
name sheriff and certain duties and so
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have any the counties don't
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
have any um the counties are simply
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state that they did
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
for various purposes so I I feel uh
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
I feel this is a I think the county
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
sheriff's departments they do a great
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
job they have enough work to do but this
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
is beyond the scope of uh what they what
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
they should be doing and this is uh
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
something that should more appropriately
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
be these issues are extremely valid
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
represent bel's concerns are extremely
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
valid but this something that should be
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
addressed at the State issue not by the
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
sheriff's so that's why I feel this bill
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary and a bad idea and quite
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
possibly based on a misunderstanding of
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
what the word tariff means in New
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law versus what it may mean in
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
in um other contexts and other other
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
places so thanks I Ur you um I I'd Ur
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
you to either itl this bill or at least
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh amend it so it's the Attorney General
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
doing those things which would probably
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
a turn out to be unnecessary and B
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
require a total rewrite of the bill so
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you see no questions thank
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Joe H I live in
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
gilmington and uh I did put through the
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
portal a summary of what I uh can
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
summarize verbally now is that
 
01:36:24.119 --> 01:36:25.709 align:start position:0%
summarize verbally now is that
that

01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill is mostly for pre something to
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
happen rather than after the fact and I
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
I gave an example of the uh grey Lord
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
case out in Chicago where the FBI went
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
in to investigate crooked uh judges in
 
01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:48.030 align:start position:0%
in to investigate crooked uh judges in
the

01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
county and uh if he or they
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
FBI were to notify the uh Sheriff he
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
might have been in cahoots with the uh
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
Court Clerk or whatever so I think uh
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
this bill should be
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
rewarded maybe to uh deal with after the
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
fact the matters that you Mr chairman
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
noticed or said something about well
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
somebody is uh disagreeable with what
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
went on they can always go to court but
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
let me tell you a little story about
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to court on the Ed Brown case I
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
presume some of you know about that uh
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:52.229 align:start position:0%
 
2005-current

01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh us attorney you mentioned somebody
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned him
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
earlier uh went in to the clerk and said
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
we uh we're going to remand this case to
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
us we're going to you're going to
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
transfer it to us and the clerk obeyed
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
and uh I found out uh title 28 us code
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
636 C1 says yes on a civil case that can
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
be done but only at the consent of both
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
parties which never done so then it
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
escalated to a criminal matter and then
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
almost somebody you know uh Steven
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
mourier the US Marshall at the time
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
wrote a book on it it's probably for
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
sale over at the bookstore I invited him
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
here today I sent him an
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
email he didn't reply though but I did
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
contact his publisher and uh I I sent uh
 
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
various emails I gave you a b CDE E and
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
F you have printouts there in front of
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
you and he the publisher said stop
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
sending me all these emails I get enough
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
of them I said sure I mean that's fine
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
with me I mean I didn't tell him that
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
but that's I stopped and so uh there
 
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
are uh incidents in there that I won't
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
go into detail now but I mean if you
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
want to get the history of some of this
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
stuff I've been dealing with the federal
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
government ever since
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
1983 when red Beckman came to town
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
running for president and I used his
 
01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
book on the case at the US District
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
Court uh and that's when Shane dine was
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
the chief judge there and I won the case
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
the IRS wanted money out of me on my
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
landlord tenants and red Beckman says oh
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
no that's an an investment that's not a
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
business so you know business tax is
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
different but I don't want to bore you
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
to death with all this other stuff I
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
just thought that uh just like in a a
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
previous bill that came to this
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee from representative Mike
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
rooster of
 
01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield uh I had a problem with I was
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
helping out Ed Brown on his Homestead
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
RSA 480 colon 1-9 and 511 colon 2 tools
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
of your trade and I read about uh Nathan
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
Clifford he was born in Romney became a
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court Judge he said the thing
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
to do is if somebody owes some money you
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
squeeze them down to half their Freehold
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
estate or Homestead and have them work
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
from there to pay off the debt and that
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't done in this case and the Brown
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
case I I tried to uh Ed Ed uh I knew Ed
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
before he went to court but I didn't
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
know the thing was happening until
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
halfway through you know an ounce of
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
prevention is worth a pound of cure so
 
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
you know I just give up free legal
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
advice you know because I've been
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
through the School of Hard KNX and the
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
bottom line here is uh well let me back
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
up uh on that case his uh her I mean his
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
wife was a dentist and her dental office
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
equipment was sold down in nashille and
 
01:40:58.990 --> 01:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
I I tried to attend that auction and I
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
was told by two US Treasury agents and
 
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
and two cops backed them up and said no
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the owner doesn't want you here and I
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
said no no this is a public uh public
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
auction I'm a member of the public no
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
invited and so I sued uh the trucking
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
company in court because of that but the
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
secretary said oh no he he never said
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
that so it was the uh US Treasury agents
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
who lied they were in contempt of court
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
the judge ordered a uh public auction
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
and uh I try to get uh something done
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
but nothing the police commission down
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
there I went to them you know there's
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
check and balance in the
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
system and uh the the thing the system
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work you know RSA 444 colon 3
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
and six you're supposed to post it and
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
file a report afterwards and then there
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
was not neither of them was done so
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
there statutes on the books that the
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
feds do not comply with they don't
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
comply with RSA 123 colon one that uh
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
says that they got a report to the
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state with the uh plan and
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
description of their building over there
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
they never did that's in the record in
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
Florida they have to report to the
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office and in Missouri the
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
show me state they don't have to report
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
at all and there Larry becraft who put a
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
a website together he has all these
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
states and they're not doing it
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
and Bill Gardner I mean one of your
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
former State reps Dan ETA he put a bill
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
in to deal with that and Bill Gardner
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
one of the your committee members went
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
over to see him and his office and he uh
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
reversed it I mean it was going to be
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
voted yes but then they said no because
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
of some uh I don't
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
know interpretation I
 
01:42:47.229 --> 01:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
guess I don't know what else to say I
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
just uh I think you about covered it but
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I I I do thank you for the
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the book um operation
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%

well that's a report by the FBI Oh I
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
thought you said there was a book well
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
the book was written by uh Steven
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
mourier called uh Nobody Has To Die
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I met Gary D Martino at an
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
event last fall in Belmont and uh he and
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
I had a picture taken together we're
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
friends now I mean back in the days when
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
I was arguing for Ed you know we like
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
almost took fists to each other you know
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
well not that not bad but you know me
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
mhm well anything I'm always looking for
 
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm always looking for another good read
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that yeah any questions
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
testimony this
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
Enders good afternoon my name is Stephen
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
Anders I'm an assistant County attorney
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
at the marac county attorney's office um
 
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
I do see House Bill 102 as being
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
problematic for a a couple of reasons
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
the first part of it would
 
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
require the sheriff to have oversight
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
over all federal law enforcement actions
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
within the county I think that you'd be
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
surprised how many federal law
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions occur within Marat
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
County or within any County um obviously
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
within any County you've got the DEA the
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
ATF the marshals service FBI you also
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
have Homeland Security
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
investigations and I'm always surprised
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
to find out about new sort of federal
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies the one that
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
recently surprised me is um the state
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
department has a Diplomatic Security
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
office or agency which covers parts of
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and where
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
that comes up is people are using fake
 
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
passport cards now as identif ification
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
which implicates um the the state
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
department so they're operating as well
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
in in a number of counties and in terms
 
01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.750 align:start position:0%
in in a number of counties and in terms
of

01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
operating you may have one federal law
 
01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer assisting local
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
police which is normally what what's
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
occurring with reference to a presence
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
at all federal uh warrants and federal
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
arrests while I don't know that you
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
could require the feds to notify us
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
those things generally warrants and
 
01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.109 align:start position:0%
those things generally warrants and
arrests

01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
arrests
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
are excuse me are planned ahead of time
 
01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.350 align:start position:0%
are excuse me are planned ahead of time
are

01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
orchestrated um obviously law
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement operates in sort of a
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
military model where you have a command
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
structure and you would have an Incident
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
Commander for warrants and arrests and
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
what becomes difficult with this is it
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
brings in the sheriff not in the
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
planning stages but on scene to sort of
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
second Guess The Incident Commander and
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
make those calls so I do think that
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's some problematic language here
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Enders it it seems to
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
me though it's clear what the sponsor's
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
intent is um is to get some type of a
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
handle on all I think you made the point
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
clear by just saying there's so many
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
agencies it's almost difficult to
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
conceive them um yeah I mean you didn't
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
mention the IRS the Secret Service I
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
mean it goes on and on so the clearly
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
that would be a heavy heavy lift to put
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
on one agency to track all those other
 
01:46:28.109 --> 01:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
agencies but is there a way that you in
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
your mind that could reach the same goal
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
whereby the citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
would feel that their rights were at
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
least being um protected in some way by
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
overreach

01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
overreach
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
my without a without getting political I
 
01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.550 align:start position:0%
my without a without getting political I
mean

01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
without without being at political on
 
01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.070 align:start position:0%
without without being at political on
this

01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
um there is obviously the Constitution
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
people are supposed to be obeying the
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's not one of these you
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
can obey the Constitution and if you
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
violate the constitution we're going to
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
suppress the evidence type thing it's a
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
hard and fast you're supposed to be
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
obeying the Constitution to the extent
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
you're not obeying the Constitution
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're violating people's constitutional
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
rights there are civil remedies
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
currently within the law um which allow
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
you to sue people and federal law
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement has my understanding is that
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
they have limited immunity so that if
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
they are in fact violating clearly
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
established constitutional rights they'd
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
be personally liable to that person for
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
those violations of those rights so I do
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
think that there's um there are systems
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
in place to prevent outof control law
 
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.470 align:start position:0%
in place to prevent outof control law
enforcement

01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
officers it seem 1983 for example I
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
believe would be the would provide for
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
treble damages whoever operating under
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
the color of law but the problem I I
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
think that perhaps the sponsor and and
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
others the citizen is again alone
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
against this Behemoth insure if he can
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
find an attorney willing to take it to
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
court and he can survive a motion to
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
dismiss at the lower levels of federal
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
court as it goes up um I wonder if it
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be inappropriate for it somehow
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this is necessarily
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
political because I'm pretty sure people
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
have both
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
political Persuasions feel at times the
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
federal government is is overstepped um
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
or or is about to overstep or so would
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
it not be inappropriate for some the
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at some level to to
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
represent the citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that their rights weren't
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
government I don't is that too political
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
right I don't know if it would be the
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's position necessarily
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
as much as us attorney since the US
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
attorney would specifically oversee the
 
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.990 align:start position:0%
attorney would specifically oversee the
federal

01:48:58.990 --> 01:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
government okay uh representative
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
share um would be fair to say that if
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
there's any federal official in New
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has an awareness of a
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
good portion if not all of the federal
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement activity going on on the
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
state it's probably the US attorney's
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
office yes do you know if the the State
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General regularly talks with
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
the US attorney's
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
office do you have any
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
idea I don't know if the State Attorney
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
General's office regularly talks to the
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
US attorney's office I know that in
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
Marram County there is a
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the it's monthly or
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
bonly investigators meeting and it's not
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
uncommon at the investigators meeting
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
for representatives from the Attorney
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
General's office as well as the US
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
attorney's office as well as federal law
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement the sheriff's department
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement investigators we
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
all get together and talk on a regular
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
basis and uh you're aware are you aware
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of state federal
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
task force to address uh
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
address What would call state federal
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
issues absolutely in addition a lot of
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
um state law enforcement officers are
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
assigned to Federal task forces as we
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
call them tfos or Task Force officers so
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
for example the US Marshals office may
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
have five people there three of them may
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
be sworn US Marshals working for the US
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
Marshals office one may be a local
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
police officer who's a TFO assigned to
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
the the Marshall's office
 
01:50:53.719 --> 01:50:57.189 align:start position:0%
the the Marshall's office
thank

01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you I hope I'm on the right
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
bill this
 
01:51:07.069 --> 01:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
time the um on the fiscal note there is
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
a sentence under
 
01:51:11.229 --> 01:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
methodology and it says since the County
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
government has no authority over Federal
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
actions and cannot compel federal
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
government to share information this
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
could lead to additional litigation at
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
the county level could you just kind of
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
comment some on what that means and what
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
kind of litigation it would be and where
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
it would come
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
from um I don't know if that would be
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
litigation uh initiated by the county to
 
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
try and get the federal government to
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
comply with the proposed
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
bill could it be the other way followup
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
could it be the other way around that
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
the county might might Sue and for that
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean it would be the
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
county suing the federal government in
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
order to get them to comply honestly I
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't think the federal government would
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
sue the county I think they would just
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
ignore the law thank
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
you um with regard to a question um the
 
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
other member asked um with regard to um
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%

that I'm opening the public hearing on
 
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 103 and I invite the prime
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
Spar to
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
spill good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee happy to be back with
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
you this bill admittedly probably the
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
most controversial one I'll have before
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
this committee this year is actually
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
more simple than it comes off if first
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
though the first the principle at play
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
with this bill is the principle of
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
Asylum Nations around the world
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
including the United States have
 
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
processes in place to receive and extend
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
Asylum protections for persons unjustly
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
persecuted by Foreign governments under
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
the principle of federalism which
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
according to our constitutions is the
 
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
nature of American governments the
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
States retain this power under the 10th
 
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment and dual sovereignty
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
really it shouldn't even be
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
controversial that states do in fact
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
have this power as the governor of New
 
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
York exercised this exact power just a
 
02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
couple days ago in refusing extradition
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
to the state of Louisiana for somebody
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
that the governor has claimed is
 
02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:40.229 align:start position:0%
that the governor has claimed is
politically

02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
persecuted this bill simply lines out a
 
02:03:46.549 --> 02:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
process by which the state of New
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could go about doing that same
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
thing we have unfortunately entered into
 
02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
an age of lawfare punishment by
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
process and the political targeting of
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
opposition our president president Trump
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
was subjected to exactly this Paradigm
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
as were many of his supporters for the
 
02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:09.950 align:start position:0%
as were many of his supporters for the
past

02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:04:13.229 --> 02:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
decade imagine if he was a New Hampshire
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
instead of Florida Citizen
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
imagine the state of New York or
 
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
California refusing to back down from
 
02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.549 align:start position:0%
California refusing to back down from
criminal

02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutions that would have prevented
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
him perhaps from serving his role as to
 
02:04:32.830 --> 02:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
duly elected president we almost had
 
02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
this scenario come to fruition until
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
that last sentencing hearing was
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
dismissed with no punishment in place I
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
bring this up not to be partisan but I
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
bring this up because if it can happen
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
to a duly elected president it can
 
02:04:50.350 --> 02:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
anyone no no citizen is safe from that
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
treatment we're now seeing such legal
 
02:05:01.229 --> 02:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
actions brought across the country for
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
things such as speech crimes
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
misinformation and various other newp
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
speak political Concepts that do not and
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
should not exist under the American form
 
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
of Republican government and
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights but is nonetheless
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
happening this bill just creates that
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
lawful process a simple
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
process to declare a
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
person politically persecuted when
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
charges are brought from another state
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
Union and to refuse the extradition of
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
that person on that
 
02:05:38.830 --> 02:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
basis and with that I would be happy to
 
02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:39.589 align:start position:0%
basis and with that I would be happy to
take

02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I'm going to
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
start with the the the biggest problem I
 
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
had with it last time and I I still
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
haven't seen to overcome is article six
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
how uh excuse me yeah art it's article
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
four um of the Constitution the full
 
02:05:58.589 --> 02:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
faith and credit how do we get beyond
 
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
that where the Constitution says we are
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
bound to recognize the laws of other
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
states and there's an extradition
 
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
portion in that same part of the
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that we have to honor
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
these exed requests how can we get
 
02:06:13.549 --> 02:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
around that that's a very good question
 
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
well let me just finish
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
because the main problem is we believe
 
02:06:19.629 --> 02:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
that that other state is violating the
 
02:06:21.549 --> 02:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution by per politically person
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
uting someone how can we in turn violate
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
the constitution in order to save them
 
02:06:29.229 --> 02:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of that circular issue
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're right actually you made a very
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
good point in that distinction the very
 
02:06:34.589 --> 02:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
last thing you said which is how can we
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
violate the constitution to protect
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
somebody who is being persecuted in
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
violation of the Constitution and that
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
actually comes down to the first
 
02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
principles of play here which admittedly
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated question that I
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
think is going to have to be sorted out
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
a bit a bit further in the courts but
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
the reality of the situation is the
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of American
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
government is is that it exists for the
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of upholding the rights of
 
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
American citizens that is the
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
foundational principle of it the exact
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
manners of in which it does that which
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
are laid out in the rest of the
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution are a secondary principle
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
to that first principle of upholding the
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
rights of American citizens so I believe
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
where there is a contradiction where
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict between those two
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
items we have to a on the side of
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
citizens thank you um
 
02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:23.470 align:start position:0%
citizens thank you um
representative

02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
Sher um so the extradition process is is
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh in on a day-to-day basis uh governed
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
correct no the the Expedition process is
 
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
governed under New Hampshire law which
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
is let me give me one second is the uh
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
it which is in accord with the
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
interstate uh the interstate rendition
 
02:07:54.270 --> 02:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh act it's a Reform Act uh that is in a
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
is in place around the country between
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
states I'm I'm a little confused are you
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that New Hampshire
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
extradition is governed not by state but
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
federal law yes New Hampshire well both
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh uh uh extradition is in
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
accord with the uniform extradition act
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
which every state has agreed to it it
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
flows from the federal extradition
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
Clause um and um so are you aware of
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of of federal law that
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
exists on this subject but as he just
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
said all the states have agreed to that
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
under the current Paradigm there's
 
02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
nothing saying a state cannot as the
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
governor of New York just did resend in
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
that agreement in part or in whole
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
through its own state
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
law and it's followup follow-up I'm
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
sorry um and it and and do you and do
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
you understand that it's
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
currently the fact the case that the
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
governor of New Hampshire can refuse to
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
extradite somebody for whatever reason
 
02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:06.950 align:start position:0%
extradite somebody for whatever reason
she

02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
she
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
chooses that's the current state of the
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
compact this would at least in part
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
bring state law up to that exact same
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
standard yes well it's already the case
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
that under under the uniform extradition
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
act that the governor has of the
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
extraditing state has the authority to
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
not extradite somebody for whatever
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
reason thank you I I think the the
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
confusion that we're getting at here is
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
what's controlling um federal law is not
 
02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
controlling of state government state
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
law is controlling of state government
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
so if we were to bring state law in
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
conformity in that manner by prescribing
 
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
that process for the governor there
 
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
would be no conflict there with the
 
02:09:57.149 --> 02:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
federal law from what I'm understanding
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of clarity for the
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee um representative Sher is it
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
your position that current federal law
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
says that any governor who's a party to
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
the agreement can refuse extradition for
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
any reason that's both federal law and
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
state law and in the state law and in
 
02:10:14.549 --> 02:10:14.559 align:start position:0%
the state the uniform extradition act
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
which is the federal law well it's it's
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
a law agreed to by all the states it's a
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
compact if you will yeah okay so but the
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
current Statute in New Hampshire does
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
not specify that the governor can refuse
 
02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
not specify that the governor can refuse
does

02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
it I haven't read that but that's that's
 
02:10:34.510 --> 02:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the governor has
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
always had that power okay all right
 
02:10:40.589 --> 02:10:40.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Newman wait
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
hold on a second representative
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:47.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm looking at
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
the line nine can you just it might
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
already be a process that I'm that I'm
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
not aware of what would it look like or
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
how would this work where it says
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
affirmed by the majority vote of the
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives how how would
 
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
that how would that be
 
02:11:08.189 --> 02:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
executed thank you for that question so
 
02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
it prescribes two methods by which
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
somebody could be uh receive essentially
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
receive Asylum under under state law uh
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
one method would be the governor the
 
02:11:19.709 --> 02:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
other method would be a majority vote of
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
the house and that would be a simple
 
02:11:24.589 --> 02:11:24.599 align:start position:0%
motion in the house to move and a vote
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
take thank you for the
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
followup so H how How would how would
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives become
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
aware like become aware of this would
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to obviously make a
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
motion but I'm confused on is that
 
02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
person contacting say you and then
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
you're bringing the motion to the
 
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
floor thank you it it just like um the
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
the privilege that exists under our
 
02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
current rules and Mason's rules any
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
member would would simply be able to
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
bring a motion to that effect and have
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
on I this just made me think of a
 
02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:05.350 align:start position:0%
on I this just made me think of a
question

02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
so if we were to enact this and if every
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
other state were to enact this obviously
 
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
it would lead to bedum so what is the
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
what is your goal at that because
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere there's a goal to get someone
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere to say okay something has to
 
02:12:20.079 --> 02:12:21.790 align:start position:0%
somewhere to say okay something has to
change

02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't know that it would
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
it would lead to bedum because I as has
 
02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
already been made very clear this is a
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
provision that exists in federal law
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
that can be refused and it's not very
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
often utilized this is really
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
forward-looking it's not looking at
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
anything that has is occurring right
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
this moment it's forward-looking based
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
on the current legal environment where
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
there is law fair being pursued outside
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the bounds of what we would consider
 
02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
normal constitutional law especially for
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
things like speech crimes where we've
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
seen people persecuted for so-called
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
misinformation which is just things that
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
people disagree with on the internet
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
stuff like that thank you representative
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
Newman I don't have a question thank
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
you represent n thank you Mr chair and
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things as we're going
 
02:13:14.109 --> 02:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
through um what you know line four and
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
five we're actually deleting um the fact
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
that this would be um subject to the
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Constitution of the
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
United States controlling and I think
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
this is kind of addressing something
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
that has already been addressed so the
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh constitutionally
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
protected activity would be uh what it's
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
based on but then it's not subject to
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
the pro provisions of the um this that
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
same Constitution so um given that and
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
then also that the governor can do this
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
already um but now what we're adding in
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
is a vote of the House of
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives is it your contention
 
02:13:47.549 --> 02:13:47.559 align:start position:0%
that in that case it is making it uh
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
over making it more or less uh politic
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
Al motivated because I I think you know
 
02:13:55.870 --> 02:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
even in the example you used I think a
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
lot of people would probably disagree on
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not that was right
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
so if it's not protected by the Baseline
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution and yet uh it would
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
be subject to the House of
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives which
 
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
sways thank you for the question
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
actually I think there's a couple
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
questions in there I'd like to break out
 
02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
individually so first there's a question
 
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
of the deletion of the the that little
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
line in here about the provision of
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution and acts of Congress you
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to have anything referring to
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution in New
 
02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law for the United States
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution to be controlling it just
 
02:14:31.629 --> 02:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
it just is so that wouldn't actually
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
have any direct effect it's really more
 
02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
important that we look the acts of
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
Congress part because as we've um
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
already seen with a little bit of
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
controversy that has occurred between
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
state and federal law state law controls
 
02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
for what is occurring in the state not
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
federal law so it creates a little bit
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
of a weird situation where presently the
 
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:52.559 align:start position:0%
language in statute is confusing because
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
it suggests that acts of Congress
 
02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
enacted in pursuance thereof therefore
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
it gives the authority to Congress for
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
the state extradition but at the same
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
time it prescribes a duty underneath it
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
that really eliminates the possibility
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
of a governor declaring somebody in any
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
not for extradition so it's confusing as
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
it currently exists that would simply
 
02:15:17.229 --> 02:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
clarify things so that we're showing
 
02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
we're demonstrating that it's not going
 
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
to be federal law that controls state
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
law state law is going to control state
 
02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
law and we're going to outline exactly
 
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
how it's going to work um beyond that
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the the next question comes to the
 
02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's political well
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
clearly yes there is a political element
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
here because we're looking at somebody
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
who may be politically persecuted uh in
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
one of the other
 
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
states however it's not an easy bar to
 
02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
meet the threshold of a majority vote of
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
the house under most conditions so it's
 
02:15:48.549 --> 02:15:48.559 align:start position:0%
not like it's not like any random person
 
02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:50.559 align:start position:0%
is just going to be winding up being
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
receiv Asylum it's going to have to take
 
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
a real movement to secure that kind of a
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
vote actually it would be much easier
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
under most circumstances to convince the
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
governor to declare that which under
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
federal law as we've heard the governor
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
already has the authority to do and this
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
just makes it a little more clean in
 
02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:08.310 align:start position:0%
just makes it a little more clean in
terms

02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
terms
 
02:16:11.549 --> 02:16:11.559 align:start position:0%
of where we're looking for our Authority
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
follow up real quick follow up so when
 
02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about taking out this
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
this part where it says the provisions
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution of the United States
 
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
controlling so you said that that is
 
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
that is understood right that's already
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
understood but you chose to take it out
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
anyway so I'm just wondering you know
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering why you include you
 
02:16:33.309 --> 02:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
could have said in any all acts uh in
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
any and all acts of the Constitution and
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean the I'm sorry any and all acts of
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
Congress enacted in the pursuance
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
thereof which you know I think actually
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
falls under that because otherwise it
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
would be challenged by the Constitution
 
02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
we would understand that but um if you
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to just take out that part why
 
02:16:50.509 --> 02:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
didn't you just take out that part
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
instead of also taking out thank you for
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
the question and it was just a matter of
 
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
making it as clean and as simple and as
 
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
short as possible because the con you
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't you just never have to say
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution controls because under
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
under law Constitution always controls
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the more important part was eliminating
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
the acts of Congress part because that
 
02:17:09.389 --> 02:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
gives direct authority to the federal
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
Congress to control New Hampshire state
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
law and extradition which is confusing
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
when we also have elements of state law
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
controlling for extradition so it was
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
really just a matter of shortening it
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
gotta thank you you I I would Hazard to
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
say that you you could write a law that
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
says um we're we're not going to obey
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it would mean nothing
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
because nothing trumps the Constitution
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
um any other questions see none thank
 
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Stephen andw
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'm an assistant County attorney in
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
Marram County uh I I do think this bill
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
is problematic as well as attorney Sher
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
said there is a state law which is the
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
uniform criminal extradition law it's
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state law it's New
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA
 
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
612 it's a uniform criminal extradition
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
law in the that all the states have
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
something similar to RSA
 
02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
612 individual states have amended the
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
language slightly so there's there's
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
certain you know little tweaks in it but
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
each state has some version of a
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
uniformed criminal extradition law the
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
way it normally works is if a person say
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
commits a crime in Virginia and flees to
 
02:18:48.030 --> 02:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there's a warrant for
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
their arrest from Virginia and they come
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
to the attention of law enforcement in
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they'd be arrested as
 
02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
what's normally referred to as a
 
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
fugitive from
 
02:18:59.950 --> 02:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
Justice uh when you're arrested as a
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
fugitive from Justice You're normally
 
02:19:03.389 --> 02:19:03.399 align:start position:0%
held there is a provision for you to be
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
released on bail but there it the
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
statute does talking about holding the
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
person and they're generally held I
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
think it's for 30 days with the option
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
to renew it for another 60 although I'm
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
not 100% sure those time frames but I
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
think all in all it gives you 90 days to
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
hold the person during that 90 day time
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
frame where the person's held they can
 
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
choose to either wave extradition and
 
02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
essentially agree to go back to the
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
demanding state or they can fight their
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
extradition if a person decides they
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
want to fight their extradition then the
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
governor of the demanding state which in
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
this case would be
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
Virginia um writes to the governor of
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and essentially files a
 
02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
requisition and says I am asking that
 
02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
you return this person to the state of
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
Virginia the governor of New Hampshire
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
does have the opportunity under
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
6124 um to investigate the crime RSA
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
6124 says the governor May investigate
 
02:20:07.870 --> 02:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
case when a demand shall be made upon
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
the governor of this state by the
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
executive authority of another state for
 
02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
the surrender of a person charged with a
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
crime the governor may call upon the
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general or any Prosecuting
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
officer in this state to investigate or
 
02:20:21.870 --> 02:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
assist an investigating the demand and
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
to report to him the situation and
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the person so demanded
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
and whether he ought to be
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
surrendered so that statute currently
 
02:20:33.389 --> 02:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
exists in New Hampshire law if the
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
governor does decide that they want to
 
02:20:37.309 --> 02:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
send the person back to the demanding
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
State the issue was referred to as a
 
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
Governor's warrant the governor's
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
warrant is then served on the person
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
who's generally incarcerated at that
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
point they're then brought in front of
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
the court they're told under RSA 61210
 
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
that they have a right to he hius Corpus
 
02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
in um the superior court and that if
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
they are not picked up in a reasonable
 
02:21:01.950 --> 02:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
amount of time by the demanding State
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
they can again petition a superior court
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh for review of their custody
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
status so that's sort of the way it it
 
02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
status so that's sort of the way it it
normally

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
normally
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
works what this statute does is allow
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to become a sanctuary
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
state for people that are claiming that
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
they're being politically
 
02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:24.630 align:start position:0%
they're being politically
prosecuted

02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
um I Heard the gentleman indicate that
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
the governor of New York has recently
 
02:21:32.429 --> 02:21:32.439 align:start position:0%
declined to extradite someone that case
 
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
is a little different because in that
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
case my understanding is that it's a
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who's in New York already who
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
prescribed medication to a person in
 
02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and again from my brief
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what this is is this is case
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
where a New York doctor um prescribed an
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
abortion drug to a woman in
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
Louisiana so that doctor didn't
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily commit a crime in Louisiana
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then flee to New York that doctor
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
was in New York the whole time and his
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
actions committed a crime in Louisiana
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
which makes it a little different under
 
02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
the uniform criminal extradition law
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
because this is dealing with people who
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
commit a crime in one state and then
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
flee to a second
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
state um this is the whole extradition
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
thing is based in the United States
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 4 section 2 of the
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
US Constitution is the extradition
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
clause the US Supreme Court has
 
02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
case excuse me it's Puerto Rico versus
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
banstead banstead is r a n s a d the
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
case can be found at 483 US
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
219 and it's a 1987 case again that's
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
483 US 219 1987 case if anyone's
 
02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
interested and essentially the US
 
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in that case said that uh
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
Governors don't have the discretion
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
to um ignore a demand that when a
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
governor receives a demand from another
 
02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:21.070 align:start position:0%
governor receives a demand from another
governor

02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
that it must be honored the US Supreme
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
Court says its mandatory language
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
furthers its intended purposes to enable
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
each state to bring offenders to trial
 
02:23:32.349 --> 02:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
as swiftly as possible in the state
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
where the alleged offense was committed
 
02:23:36.190 --> 02:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
and to preclude any state from becoming
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
a sanctuary for fugitives of Justice
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
from another state what happened in uh
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico versus banstead
 
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
is an
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
individual I don't remember what state
 
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
it was I want to say it was in the
 
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
midwest somewhere was accused to have
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
committed I believe it was a murder in
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico and they left Puerto Rico
 
02:23:59.550 --> 02:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
went back to whatever state they were in
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the midwest Puerto Rico tried to
 
02:24:03.790 --> 02:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
extradite the individual back to Puerto
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
Rico the state refused to surrender them
 
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
and Puerto Rico actually sued the state
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
in a in federal court and said you don't
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have the authority to not
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
surrender them and and again that was
 
02:24:19.269 --> 02:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
upheld so I think that as this bill is
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
written um in in addition to my my own
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
opinion being that not really a great
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
idea to set ourselves up to be a
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state for criminals from other
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
states to come here um I think it would
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional under the current US
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank you um given that
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case doesn't it make all
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
the the language in in the uniform
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
agreement or uniform law moot I mean
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
you say the person can petition the
 
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
governor and they can also behaved into
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
court where they can also argue it's all
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
mood if they have to honor isn't it I
 
02:25:02.429 --> 02:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
mean if the con if the scotus already
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
said youve got to honor these I I think
 
02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
it is that original provision that I
 
02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:07.349 align:start position:0%
it is that original provision that I
read

02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:25:10.830 --> 02:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
6124 um was passed in 1937 and again
 
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
that was part of the original uniform um
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
criminal extradition law
 
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
before um Barnstead banstead was okay
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
was decided in
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
1987 there was case law I believe from
 
02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
1987 there was case law I believe from
the

02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
1860s that talked about um fugitive yeah
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
fugitive slaves and essentially whether
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
or not those laws could be enforced the
 
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
federal government initially said no we
 
02:25:42.590 --> 02:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
can't do that yeah and in banstead they
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
changed their mind and said No in fact
 
02:25:48.429 --> 02:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
we can enforce extraditions
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay also with regard to this um you
 
02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
brought up the New York case so
 
02:25:56.830 --> 02:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
according to Brad that's clearly
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and illegal um or are
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
is there the suggestion that be I mean
 
02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
isn't there something called a long arm
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
principle yeah the long arm is generally
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
a civil thing what the difference is
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a difference between if I
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
go to Vermont commit a crime in Vermont
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
and flee to New Hampshire or whether I
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
commit a crime in Vermont from my house
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and there's certain
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
ways I could do that whether it's say
 
02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
for example identity theft or that type
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
of thing um if I've committed the crime
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
physically in Vermont I don't think the
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
governor has a choice about whether or
 
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
not to extradite me into Vermont but if
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
I've never left my house in New
 
02:26:43.269 --> 02:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think the governor does have
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
a choice of whether or not to extradite
 
02:26:48.429 --> 02:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
me to Vermont if I've never been there
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
before or if my crime occurred in New
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this argument would have to
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
take place clearly in US District Court
 
02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
based on the Supreme Court case to the
 
02:27:00.910 --> 02:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
extent there was a lawsuit to force the
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
extradition would be in federal court
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
Sher as a part of the extradition
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
process uh uh there's the hearing that
 
02:27:14.190 --> 02:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
the person being that the the other
 
02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
state is demanding state is asking to be
 
02:27:20.349 --> 02:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
extradited there's a hearing at which uh
 
02:27:20.359 --> 02:27:22.150 align:start position:0%
extradited there's a hearing at which uh
uh

02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
um some
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
entity often the local prosecutor has to
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
right so I have not encountered that um
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
I you can de you can essentially say no
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not the person they're looking
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
for um and we would have to make a
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
showing that in fact you are the person
 
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
they're looking for but that generally
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
is limited to identification not
 
02:27:59.309 --> 02:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily the elements of the crime
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't there have to be a showing that
 
02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:03.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't there have to be a showing that
there's

02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
a pending valid charge in the demanding
 
02:28:13.389 --> 02:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
State yes um and follow up I'm sorry I
 
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
apologize um I if you just want to ask
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
isn't there a a string of basic things
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
that have to be proven before someone is
 
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
just handed over is that where we're
 
02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:27.750 align:start position:0%
just handed over is that where we're
going

02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah is that what you're asking uh
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of what I'm asking
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um and and I do have a follow on
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the combination of the Constitution
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the uniform criminal extradition act
 
02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:53.230 align:start position:0%
and the uniform criminal extradition act
um

02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
empowers the executive Authority in the
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
demanding State and in the potential
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
sending state to take certain actions to
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
render the uh individual into
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
custody looking at the the the the bill
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
as written it seems to involve the uh
 
02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
State Legislature in that process uh
 
02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
that's the proposal uh as one
 
02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:20.670 align:start position:0%
that's the proposal uh as one
alternative

02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
is there are there potential separation
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
of powers concerns about bringing the
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
legislature into that process given the
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
development of the extradition
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
clause I I do think that you would face
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
separation of power issues
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
um because prosecution is a purely
 
02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:42.670 align:start position:0%
um because prosecution is a purely
executive

02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
executive
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
function thank
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
you if you're aware does the
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution of New Hampshire provide
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
any method or mechan mechanism for the
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
clemency I I don't think it does
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
um and I I know that they generally look
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
at it in the opposite way that the
 
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislature can't find someone guilty um
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't know I think clemency is a
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
purely executive function as well within
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's office I think normally I
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
would agree but I something in the back
 
02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
of my mind is saying because we used to
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
be the court General Court there may be
 
02:30:23.710 --> 02:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
some old things kicking around that I I
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
need to look at it um thank you further
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a quick question
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
about 612 Co colon 4 in the last few
 
02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
sentences s indicate that there is a
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
report um as to whether he ought to be
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
surrendered surrended or not I suppose
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
is is implied so that so that is what
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
gives the authority to the governor to
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
make a determination on whether they
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
will um actually apply uh reply to the
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
demand or E extradite the person is that
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
I think that is implied in
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
6124 although I think under current case
 
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
law that would be unconstitutional for
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
them to not agree to exate the person
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
follow would would would that be New
 
02:31:17.269 --> 02:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law New Hampshire state
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
law makes this unconstitution or federal
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
state law federal law would make um RSA
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
6124 I think
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional thank
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else anyone else wishing to
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill who hasn't done so
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none here by Clos the public

now for any of you who are new and
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
weren't on the committee last year uh
 
03:34:21.750 --> 03:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
let me explain the Open Fields doctrine
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
that this is trying to fix 100 years ago
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court made a ruling during
 
03:34:28.590 --> 03:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
prohibition to give the government full
 
03:34:30.269 --> 03:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
and unfettered access to people's
 
03:34:32.110 --> 03:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
private property except for their actual
 
03:34:34.189 --> 03:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
dwelling in the immediate curtilage so
 
03:34:35.710 --> 03:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
that they could go in and start smashing
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
Stills and taking people's uh moonshine
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
operations um that has stood for 100
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
years so that even your
 
03:34:47.950 --> 03:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
right next to your house is not
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
inviolate from authorities coming in
 
03:34:52.110 --> 03:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
without a warrant and without your
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
permission to post cameras or to look
 
03:34:57.429 --> 03:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
for evidence or do what have you without
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
your permission even if you've got it
 
03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
fenced off and posted and what have you
 
03:35:04.269 --> 03:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
um the reason is because we haven't been
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
able to get a court a case up in front
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the Supreme Court that has standing
 
03:35:08.910 --> 03:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
to have it
 
03:35:11.229 --> 03:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
overturned there were a lot of erroneous
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases uh ruled on that
 
03:35:16.030 --> 03:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
have been overturned over the years and
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
this is one that's just constantly been
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
missed because nobody's brought a case
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
withstanding so states are one by one
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
closing the loophole locally uh and
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
basically giving people back the privacy
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
of their lands as long as they are
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
fenced or posted the government agency
 
03:35:31.680 --> 03:35:32.469 align:start position:0%
fenced or posted the government agency
should

03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
have landowner permission or a warrant
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
before they enter that property and with
 
03:35:39.189 --> 03:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
that I'll take any
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative um so
 
03:35:44.790 --> 03:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
with the new change I'm I'm a I'm just a
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
little concerned that we may have um
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
thrown out the baby with the bath water
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
so to speak if it says they can go
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere any agency can go anywhere as
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
Allowed by law if the current state of
 
03:36:00.510 --> 03:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
the law would allow them to do it um
 
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
would that in other words have we just
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
not really done anything
 
03:36:08.590 --> 03:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
then I will leave that distinction to
 
03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
then I will leave that distinction to
the

03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
professional that knows about this a lot
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
better than I am I I do um the language
 
03:36:19.469 --> 03:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
is intended to state only as provided by
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
our state law in our passages not to
 
03:36:25.189 --> 03:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
refer to the current ruling of the
 
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court law and I'm not sure if
 
03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
that if you're what you're asking is
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
actually delineated by that comment yeah
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think there's a distinction
 
03:36:36.990 --> 03:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
I think once the Supreme Court rules it
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
is the law of the land but uh Prof uh
 
03:36:42.990 --> 03:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sher if you don't mind
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
um a couple questions um
 
03:36:49.229 --> 03:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
the current state of the law with from
 
03:36:53.950 --> 03:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court is that you need a
 
03:36:57.189 --> 03:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
warrant to go onto somebody's property
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
that is characterized as the curtilage
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
that is the property on which their
 
03:37:04.710 --> 03:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
houses that they do Daily Business so
 
03:37:07.630 --> 03:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
it's not the case that the the people
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
can go on the police can go on any of
 
03:37:15.150 --> 03:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
your property um part one part two was
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
that a question question or I'm getting
 
03:37:21.950 --> 03:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.269 --> 03:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
so do you want this bill
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
to overturn the US Supreme
 
03:37:34.389 --> 03:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
Court current
 
03:37:38.189 --> 03:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
policy that uh the police can go on
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
let's call it the back 40 without a
 
03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
warrant the intent is to keep them off
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the back 40 if the back is posted or
 
03:37:49.030 --> 03:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
fenced without a warrant or landowner
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
permission and that would be and fair to
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
say that would contradict the current US
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court law correct but all it's
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
doing is telling our state officials
 
03:38:02.910 --> 03:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
that our state policy is you must get a
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
a warrant or permission before you do it
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
so it's been passed already in this
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
manner in I don't know 13 states or so
 
03:38:12.870 --> 03:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
again it's a number I don't have exactly
 
03:38:17.710 --> 03:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.720 --> 03:38:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
Newman I'm just wondering if that law
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
which talks about fenced and otherwise
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
enclosed in H or in part to exclude
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
intrudes was that is that different from
 
03:38:34.950 --> 03:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
what was in the bill last time no okay
 
03:38:34.960 --> 03:38:37.469 align:start position:0%
what was in the bill last time no okay
thank

03:38:37.469 --> 03:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you I have to get back to my
 
03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:44.429 align:start position:0%
you thank you I have to get back to my
own

03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:57.389 --> 03:38:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
McHugh thank you Mr chairman good
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the
 
03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
committee nice to see nice to see you
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
today thanks for running on time my
 
03:39:08.309 --> 03:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee is hours behind so this is
 
03:39:10.990 --> 03:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
great that you guys are right on time um
 
03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here today for House Bill 206 and I
 
03:39:15.550 --> 03:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
know you've heard most of this before
 
03:39:17.590 --> 03:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
and my colleague from Rockingham
 
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
District 2 explained it adequately I'll
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
just give a couple examples why I'm here
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
to support it I know we passed it last
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
year and it did make it through the
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
Senate uh maybe I can help with that
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
this year couple of my colleagues uh
 
03:39:34.510 --> 03:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
senators inis and genin and uh will
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully help out as well uh let me
 
03:39:40.070 --> 03:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
just Begin by saying that um we're not
 
03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
here to put obstacles in front of our
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
law enforcement this is really about
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
protecting some of the cor Val first of
 
03:39:47.229 --> 03:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
all I'm Senator Tim MCU I represent
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
marac uh marac Milford ammeron Wilton
 
03:39:52.110 --> 03:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
which is Senate District 11 sorry for
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
not introducing myself but we're not
 
03:39:55.630 --> 03:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
here to put obstacles in front of our
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement we're here to protect
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
some of the core values that are
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
enshrined right in our constitution
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
since we passed that Constitutional
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment guaranteeing our right to
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
privacy if you don't happen to remember
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
um last year the very first bill the
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
governor signed was the digital Privacy
 
03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
Act it was sent a bill 255 and I was one
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the co-sponsors and I know this isn't
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
about digital privacy but it is about
 
03:40:18.510 --> 03:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
privacy it's about simply asking our law
 
03:40:20.429 --> 03:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement to get a warrant if you want
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
to go on the back 40 and a lot of states
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
have done it it's not a radical idea not
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
a radical idea Montana for instance the
 
03:40:29.309 --> 03:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
courts enforced requirement of obtaining
 
03:40:31.389 --> 03:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
obtaining a warrant a warrant uh
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
Montana's Supreme Court I like to think
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're a little like a little like
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
Montana in terms of respecting freedom
 
03:40:39.070 --> 03:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
and liberty and State versus bulock in
 
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
1995 that was quite a long time ago
 
03:40:43.710 --> 03:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
Tennessee did it in 1997 State versus
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
prior um so we have a long history of
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
respecting property rights and I think
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
this bill goes a step uh in doing that
 
03:40:52.510 --> 03:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the technical correction
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
that was made in this draft will make it
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
through both bodies and I hope I can
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
help uh do that I think it's pretty
 
03:40:59.710 --> 03:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward and fair it provides
 
03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
some clear guidance making any evidence
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
obtained in violation of these rules in
 
03:41:06.189 --> 03:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
admissible in court it reinforces the
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
property owner's rights uh and
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
simultaneously it allows the necessary
 
03:41:12.990 --> 03:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions in cases of consent uh or
 
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
exent circumstances it allows our Law
 
03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Act officers to act
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
decisively if they have an emergent
 
03:41:21.790 --> 03:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
threat to life or Public Safety these
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
are critical things I'm a paramedic
 
03:41:26.910 --> 03:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
myself uh so we know you know if we can
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
look through the window or if we hear
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
signs of distress that we can make uh
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
make an entrance make an entry uh when
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
we need to do so um so importantly this
 
03:41:39.389 --> 03:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
is not a blanket restriction on any
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
government or regulatory agency um and
 
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
it does uh distinguish um conservation
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
officers and Fishing Game Commission
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
officers while preserving their
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
Authority in protecting our wildlife and
 
03:41:55.550 --> 03:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
natural resources uh under uh 206 so I'm
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
urging you guys to support uh the
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to support this
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
particular draft and I hope when it
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
makes to the other body that I can help
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
it all the way through the process so
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time uh I'm
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
by no means an expert I know there's
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
some experts behind us in law
 
03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I'm happy to try and take
 
03:42:14.550 --> 03:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll probably defer to
 
03:42:17.229 --> 03:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
some of the experts behind us well thank
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%

close this Open Fields loophole that
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Spain and Senator
 
03:43:19.590 --> 03:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
McHugh were just talking about I'm going
 
03:43:22.149 --> 03:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
to be very clear what does this bill do
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is a private property
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
protection bill it is not an anti-law
 
03:43:27.870 --> 03:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement bill is not an
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
anti-government bill this protects the
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
back 40 this protects the woods behind
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
your home the the the field in front of
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
your home from government intrusion
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
unless the government agent has a
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
warrant uh an exception to the warrant
 
03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
like an ex um excuse me an exigent
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
circumstance if somebody needed help if
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
they saw somebody destroying evidence
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
that might be relev relevant to a crime
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
being committed um or criminal
 
03:43:56.670 --> 03:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
prosecution they can enter the property
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
um or they can go of course and walk
 
03:44:01.630 --> 03:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
onto the land and get the land owners's
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
consent uh to uh look around and
 
03:44:08.149 --> 03:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
investigate on the property um why is
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:44:12.269 --> 03:44:12.279 align:start position:0%
needed uh several other states around
 
03:44:15.389 --> 03:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
the country have uh including U Vermont
 
03:44:19.590 --> 03:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
and New York uh have already uh extended
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
this Open Fields loophole protection to
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
their citizens um we are not seeing j is
 
03:44:26.670 --> 03:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
not seeing any sort of evidence from
 
03:44:28.189 --> 03:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
those states that law enforcement
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
activities are significantly frustrated
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
or that government cannot execute its
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
important functions because of this uh
 
03:44:36.990 --> 03:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
this change and this heighten protection
 
03:44:39.070 --> 03:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
that is afforded uh this is about
 
03:44:41.950 --> 03:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
protecting people's property rights and
 
03:44:45.269 --> 03:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
um making sure that people are secure in
 
03:44:47.590 --> 03:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
their property and have that
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
privacy um just briefly I want to be
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
very clear too what does this bill not
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
do it does not
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
prevent uh anybody from going any
 
03:44:57.550 --> 03:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
government agent from going up to
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's house just like a somebody
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
selling Girl Scout cookies or a you know
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
salesman can go up to somebody's house
 
03:45:04.990 --> 03:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
knock on the door and say hey I'm here I
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
want to take a look around can I get
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
your consent or make contact or do a
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
welfare check this does not prevent
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely not prevent any other state
 
03:45:17.149 --> 03:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
agency from uh investigating uh you know
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
or regulating Banks or hospitals this
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
only applies to private land that is
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
posted on somebody's private property
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
does not apply to a a business premises
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
like a building or otherwise so with
 
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
that I would strongly uh encourage you
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
and respectfully ask you to uh support
 
03:45:37.710 --> 03:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
this bill and I am here to answer any
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have thank you so
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you um I'd like to ask the
 
03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
question I asked the um sponsor
 
03:45:49.590 --> 03:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
this addition to kind of alleviate the
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
worries that some people had with regard
 
03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
to government agents being able to do
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
their non-law enforcement related jobs
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
is there no concern from your agency
 
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
that this might be too
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
broad um the intention behind that
 
03:46:07.990 --> 03:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
language was to make it clear that other
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
premises meaning not secured premises or
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
not private land um would not be subject
 
03:46:16.030 --> 03:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
to the scope of this bill this bill
 
03:46:19.389 --> 03:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
really only applies to Simply private
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
land that is posted um it does not apply
 
03:46:23.710 --> 03:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
to Banks it does not apply to schools it
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
does not apply to hospitals um if uh
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
chair Roy you think that language is is
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
too broad I would venture a guess and
 
03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
say that rep Blain would be uh open to
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
amending it to clarify it um in a way
 
03:46:38.990 --> 03:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable but um again
 
03:46:40.349 --> 03:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
the purpose is just to make it clear
 
03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
that this is very limited in scope
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
understood and further question
 
03:46:48.750 --> 03:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative share
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
um let's assume the property is posted
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
and fenced in uh what about
 
03:46:57.439 --> 03:46:58.990 align:start position:0%
and fenced in uh what about
flyovers

03:46:58.990 --> 03:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
flyovers
 
03:47:01.189 --> 03:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
um would they need a warrant for a
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
flyover under this
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill like a helicopter flying over and
 
03:47:09.469 --> 03:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
looking down uh with enhanced uh
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
binoculars looking down on the property
 
03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
no let's assume they know the property
 
03:47:14.600 --> 03:47:16.910 align:start position:0%
no let's assume they know the property
is

03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
posted that is a good question I do not
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
believe it would I mean we're talking
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
about the entry into somebody's private
 
03:47:27.670 --> 03:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
property on on land um I guess it sort
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
of begs the question though what the
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of the fly if it's just a
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
helicopter flying over or if somebody's
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
trying to uh do surveillance yeah it
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be surveillance I mean there's
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
plenty of cases out there where uh the
 
03:47:44.189 --> 03:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
police uh suspect a person is growing
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
marijuana on the back 40 you know some
 
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
of these cases are a lot of them are
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
from California and and um and
 
03:47:55.950 --> 03:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
they hi uh get a helicopter or a plane
 
03:47:58.510 --> 03:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
and fly over the property and take
 
03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
pictures with enhanced uh vision for
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
lack of a better way of putting it um so
 
03:48:05.550 --> 03:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
it would be for surveillance again let's
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
assume they know the property is posted
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
how does this address that at all or
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
should this address
 
03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
that not to give a frustrating lawyer
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
answer but it does sort of depend right
 
03:48:18.030 --> 03:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
I mean if they're flying over with the
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of looking into somebody's home
 
03:48:22.149 --> 03:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
or curage or that activity is included
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
in that fly over that would be subject
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
to wellestablished pre-existing
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections for
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's home if it's somebody's
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
private land um I I suppose it would be
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
hard not to push back on the
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
hypothetical to know whether it's posted
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
or not but I think uh this
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
would I would have to get back to you to
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
give you a more fome answer on that sir
 
03:48:46.990 --> 03:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that because these are
 
03:48:50.590 --> 03:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
these are the hard cases um you know I
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
there's are you aware of the cases that
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
that that say that you know they can
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
look at somebody's curtilage for example
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's a case with there a greenhouse
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
that's got some broken windows in it and
 
03:49:05.790 --> 03:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
they which is part of the curtilage and
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
they Overlook it and US Supreme Court
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
has said that's fine that's not a Fourth
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment violation you aware that case
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
yes sir that's right I mean if something
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
is in plain view then it is not as
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's an exception to the Fourth
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment Doctrine right but if it's
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
something that is a part of like a
 
03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:24.750 align:start position:0%
something that is a part of like a
surveillance

03:49:24.750 --> 03:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
program um or using drones to fly over
 
03:49:30.990 --> 03:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's property uh that would
 
03:49:33.710 --> 03:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
implicate more constitutional concerns
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
as it relates to like a surveillance
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
drag net right so it it it does matter
 
03:49:39.990 --> 03:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
the intention of the officers or the
 
03:49:41.229 --> 03:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
people surveilling whether they're
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
government agents or just private
 
03:49:45.030 --> 03:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
citizens I think we've establish this
 
03:49:47.229 --> 03:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't cover drones um and I
 
03:49:48.750 --> 03:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
believe there's a case that talks about
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
how many feet above your house is your
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
own property and not so um I think that
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be covered in a totally
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
different bill that's right but I would
 
03:49:57.790 --> 03:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer those uh additional
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have sir yeah
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
further questions see a none thank you
 
03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you very
 
03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Stephen erson
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'm an assistant County attorney in
 
03:50:29.070 --> 03:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
marac County um I I am opposed to this
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill the the difficulty is we already
 
03:50:34.510 --> 03:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
have a Constitution and the Constitution
 
03:50:36.750 --> 03:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
already says if law enforcement is
 
03:50:37.870 --> 03:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
entering a place where there's an
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy they need a
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
warrant or an exception to the warrant
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
requirement So based on that I guess I
 
03:50:47.590 --> 03:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
don't really see necessarily the purpose
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
for this and I I start to get a little
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
confused when we start talking about the
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
back 40 and and what that means so to me
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
the back 40 means I own 40 acres of
 
03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
property that is not posted in any way
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire if I own the back 40
 
03:51:11.830 --> 03:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
meaning I own a giant piece of property
 
03:51:14.149 --> 03:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's not posted in any way members of
 
03:51:16.590 --> 03:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
the public are free to enter my property
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
to hunt to cross country ski to ride
 
03:51:21.870 --> 03:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
mountain bikes to do whatever type of
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
recreation they want to do unless I
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
specifically post my property to
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
say you can't enter you can't hunt that
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
type of
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
thing so I have a difficult concept with
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
the idea that the back 40 is open to
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state except law
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I this bill refers to
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
posted land it it well it refers to
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
secured premises but then it also refers
 
03:51:53.830 --> 03:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
to private
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
land so line 12 defines secured premises
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
meaning land which is
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
posted and it says unless authorized by
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
law the government shall not enter to
 
03:52:08.590 --> 03:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
secured premises well that's already the
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
state of the law is if you have an
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy in your property
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can't enter it without a
 
03:52:17.550 --> 03:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
warrant I believe the Open Fields
 
03:52:20.189 --> 03:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
Doctrine specifically says regardless if
 
03:52:22.510 --> 03:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's posted or not a warrant's not
 
03:52:25.309 --> 03:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
required I to me it comes down to
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's an expectation of
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
privacy in that property if you build
 
03:52:31.630 --> 03:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
defense around your property I think
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that the police
 
03:52:37.630 --> 03:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
need a warrant to enter that property um
 
03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
then it refers to further down just
 
03:52:39.560 --> 03:52:40.510 align:start position:0%
then it refers to further down just
private

03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
private
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
land which I guess private land is
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
somehow different than a secured
 
03:52:48.389 --> 03:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
premises I would assume private land is
 
03:52:51.510 --> 03:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
land owned by anybody upon ENT and it
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
requires upon entering private land that
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
you notify the landowner but again in
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you can enter private land
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
for recreation purposes for hunting
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
purposes without notifying any land
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
owners and then it says
 
03:53:11.070 --> 03:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
that you have to show your search
 
03:53:12.870 --> 03:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
warrant upon entering private land but
 
03:53:14.189 --> 03:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't necessarily need a search
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
warrant to enter private land that's not
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
a secured
 
03:53:19.710 --> 03:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
premises um and
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
then again all of these statutes have
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
these exclusionary rules within them uh
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
six and seven say any evidence obtained
 
03:53:32.910 --> 03:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
pursuant is inadmissible meaning you
 
03:53:34.750 --> 03:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
would exclude all that evidence and
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
section seven talks about arrests
 
03:53:40.189 --> 03:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
made would be
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
invalid um again we have a
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional theory of excluding
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
evidence for constitutional violations
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it always strikes me as
 
03:53:54.910 --> 03:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
um as hard for me to accept that we have
 
03:53:54.920 --> 03:53:55.870 align:start position:0%
um as hard for me to accept that we have
the

03:53:55.870 --> 03:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
same the same remedy for a statutory
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
violation as we would for a
 
03:54:02.750 --> 03:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation meaning that
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
the government um loses all of their
 
03:54:09.149 --> 03:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
evidence and then with reference to the
 
03:54:13.229 --> 03:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
arrest being um invalid I don't know
 
03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that necessarily makes sense
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
because an arrest is merely a way to get
 
03:54:19.229 --> 03:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
a person into
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
court I believe it would be the fruit of
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
the poisonous tree by what you found on
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
during the arrest incident the arrest
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
but you could certainly just issue a
 
03:54:29.349 --> 03:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
second arrest warrant or arrest them at
 
03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
a different
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
time so I don't see um suppressing the
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
arrest as
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
being M making any sense to me but I'm
 
03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer questions as
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
well did you did you oppose this last
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
um taking the Open Fields
 
03:54:56.590 --> 03:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
Doctrine as it stands in assuming for
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
the sake of discussion that the the
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire have expressed
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
through their support of the recent
 
03:55:05.149 --> 03:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment for their their
 
03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
will for privacy against the government
 
03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
what would be an appropriate way to
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
express that to keep law enforcement
 
03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
from disregarding the person's wishes
 
03:55:20.910 --> 03:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
for privacy in light of the Open Fields
 
03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
Doctrine how how in other words if it's
 
03:55:24.790 --> 03:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
fencing that's an awful expensive thing
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
to make somebody have to do to keep
 
03:55:29.469 --> 03:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
their private their property
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
private so whether or not you have a
 
03:55:33.429 --> 03:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy in a
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
place is is sort of a twofold inquiry
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
the first is whether or not you've
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
expressed a reasonable expectation of
 
03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
privacy in that area and the second is
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a expectation
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
that's Society is willing to
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
accept so I think certainly if you
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
posted your land in a way that showed
 
03:55:52.830 --> 03:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
you had a reasonable expectation of
 
03:55:55.229 --> 03:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
privacy within that land and that was
 
03:55:57.910 --> 03:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
something that Society had was willing
 
03:56:02.189 --> 03:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
to accept you you reach the point of the
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
government we need a warrant to enter
 
03:56:03.720 --> 03:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
government we need a warrant to enter
that

03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
location further questions
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sher um I finally found
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
the case I was looking for are you aware
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
of Oliver versus United States where the
 
03:56:20.510 --> 03:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
police entered posted and fenced
 
03:56:23.910 --> 03:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
property and the Court held that the uh
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
the property owner did not have a
 
03:56:29.189 --> 03:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy which
 
03:56:32.429 --> 03:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
is it's the kind of uh the current Open
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
Fields Doctrine case it's a 1984 case um
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
I can't say I'm familiar with it thank
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
you yeah that that's the actual the case
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Open Fields Doctrine case
 
03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:48.429 align:start position:0%
the Open Fields Doctrine case
representative

03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
Newman I just have a question about one
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that you mentioned and it
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
had to do with the
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
fence and it talk it says um which is
 
03:56:59.950 --> 03:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
fenced or otherwise enclosed and H or
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
apart so as to exclude
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
Intruders um I'm wondering whether that
 
03:57:08.910 --> 03:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
means that if they put a fence up to
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
keep some cattle in out on their back 40
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere um it how did is that fit is
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
that is that to exclude Intruders or is
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
it to keep the cattle inside or or is
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
that an issue for this bill also it just
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
fenced part of it right I think that's
 
03:57:27.469 --> 03:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
it certainly an arguable point about
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of the fence
 
03:57:32.189 --> 03:57:32.199 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further
 
03:57:38.550 --> 03:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair calls representative
 
03:57:41.120 --> 03:57:49.110 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair calls representative
gon

03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:49.120 --> 03:57:52.590 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair honorable
 
03:57:57.030 --> 03:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh something that the last
 
03:57:59.070 --> 03:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
testimony mentioned kind of got my
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
attention this is with regard to
 
03:58:03.750 --> 03:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
Uniformed government officials acting in
 
03:58:07.030 --> 03:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
an official capacity like I own a small
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
parcel of land that is not marked no
 
03:58:12.149 --> 03:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
trespassing and I understand reasonably
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
that I may go out back and see
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know somebody hiking somebody cross
 
03:58:19.710 --> 03:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
country skiing a dirt bike prudent use
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
non-damaging of that of that land
 
03:58:23.550 --> 03:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not posted what I do not
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
expect to go into my backyard and see is
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
uniformed government officials or law
 
03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in an official
 
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
capacity now if there is an off-duty
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
police officer hiking on my land or
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
cross country skiing I would never know
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
that and that wouldn't bother me anyway
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
but this protects the private property
 
03:58:42.510 --> 03:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
owner from government coming onto the
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
property in an official capacity without
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
a warrant whether it's a prudent search
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
or not and collecting evidence
 
03:58:51.990 --> 03:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
intentionally or accidentally without
 
03:58:54.389 --> 03:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
without um activating the proper
 
03:58:57.309 --> 03:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
protocols so at fundamental basis this
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
is a property rights and an individual
 
03:59:01.469 --> 03:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
rights Bill and one of the things I try
 
03:59:03.790 --> 03:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
to remind people when I testify is it is
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
the duty of this body to protect the
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
rights of the people and this is one of
 
03:59:10.110 --> 03:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
those things thank
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
you we appreciate you reminding them us
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
our duty any questions
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
Sergeant thank you Mr chairman members
 
03:59:38.269 --> 03:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:59:41.070 --> 03:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Eric Sergeant I
 
03:59:43.149 --> 03:59:43.159 align:start position:0%
am the Serv as Department
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
transportations min administr for the
 
03:59:47.070 --> 03:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of rway for those of you who may
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
not know the main function of the rway
 
03:59:50.790 --> 03:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
bureau is to acquire lands for proposed
 
03:59:53.309 --> 03:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
Highway projects some of the early steps
 
03:59:54.910 --> 03:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
in this process is to establish the
 
03:59:57.469 --> 03:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
limits of the public right of way to
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
accomplish this department must conduct
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
field surveys which may require entering
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
into private lands abing the
 
04:00:06.229 --> 04:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
highway I would like to make clear that
 
04:00:08.189 --> 04:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
these surveys are not to investigate any
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
crime or the property owner themselves
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
they are simply to locate boundary
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
monuments such as Granite bounds iron
 
04:00:16.510 --> 04:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
pins fences and stone walls which is
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to determine the limits of the
 
04:00:21.149 --> 04:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
RightWay additional features such as C
 
04:00:24.429 --> 04:00:24.439 align:start position:0%
stange uh cover driveways buildings that
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
may be impacted by the proposed
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
improvements are also located to be
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
accurately plotted on Highway plans I
 
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
should note that there is no need to
 
04:00:35.189 --> 04:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
enter the buildings but only locate the
 
04:00:35.199 --> 04:00:36.229 align:start position:0%
enter the buildings but only locate the
outside

04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
outside
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
perimeters the Department's current
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
practice is to notify the budding
 
04:00:41.309 --> 04:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
Property Owners within the project
 
04:00:42.990 --> 04:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
limits 10 days prior to the upcoming
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
survey work
 
04:00:47.309 --> 04:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
contact information is also provided if
 
04:00:48.870 --> 04:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
the butter has any
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions Authority for these surveys is
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%

04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
33 the proposed language of this bill
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
makes exceptions for fishing game and
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
their authority to enter private lands
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
but no other agency Our concern is this
 
04:01:06.269 --> 04:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
may be construed as no agency other than
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
fishing game may enter private lands
 
04:01:10.229 --> 04:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
without a search warrant therefore we
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee consider
 
04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
language being added to include the
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
authority Grant to the Department of

Transportation under RSA
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
22833 I do have that language here which
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
we have shared with the sponsor who sees
 
04:01:28.349 --> 04:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
no issues with it have you do you have
 
04:01:32.229 --> 04:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
the latest version of the bill with um
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
section nine starting on line 11 that
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this section shall be
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
construed to limit restrict or impair
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
the access of any governmental or
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency to buildings
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
businesses or other premises as provided
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
by law that sounds like it's tailor
 
04:01:51.550 --> 04:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
written for you yes I I I am aware of
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
that sir thank you and it was only be
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
again because fishing game themselves
 
04:01:58.030 --> 04:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
were called out and so no but so you're
 
04:01:59.790 --> 04:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
okay with that current language then yes
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
okay good all right I thought you were
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
asking for something else too well we
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
did have some proposed language to add
 
04:02:07.830 --> 04:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
to add the exception to include dep
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation as well I
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
wonder if we start naming departments
 
04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
specifically instead of broadly we're
 
04:02:15.309 --> 04:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
going to start getting a long list as
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
long as you feel like this covers you
 
04:02:19.469 --> 04:02:19.479 align:start position:0%
and specifically since
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
22833 provides you access by law this
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
seems to cover your agency um so I think
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
we we'll be fine with that any further
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for what
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
now you have one yeah go ahead yes I'm
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Newman do you know of
 
04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
any other agencies that had that do that
 
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
kind of surveying work that that you and
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
it would cover all of you I think that's
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm not aware of a
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
specific that does
 
04:02:51.149 --> 04:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.110 --> 04:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.429 --> 04:03:08.439 align:start position:0%
Goldstein sir did did you join the
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
priesthood you still in the law
 
04:03:12.670 --> 04:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement I know you retired but I
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know you went
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
caller there we go for the record my
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
name is David Goldstein I'm presently
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
the retired Chief recently retired Chief
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
from Franklin Police Department I've
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
been a police officer for 46 years I'm
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
presently employed part-time by the
 
04:03:41.149 --> 04:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
Rockham County Sheriff's Office uh as a
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
part-time deputy and I coordinating them
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
mental health and wellness uh efforts uh
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
however I also chair the chief's
 
04:03:51.070 --> 04:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and that's why I
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
appear before you here today in
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
04:03:57.870 --> 04:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
bill you've heard uh some very eloquent
 
04:03:59.309 --> 04:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
testimony especially from the county
 
04:04:01.990 --> 04:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
attorney's office and I won't uh spend
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
some time over that but I do think that
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's important and I have to agree with
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
Socrates in that we learn best by asking
 
04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
questions and getting answers to those
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
questions so I'm going to try to provide
 
04:04:15.149 --> 04:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
a few examples that might help put some
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
of this in perspective first and
 
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
foremost and perhaps most importantly is
 
04:04:20.189 --> 04:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
exactly what was said a little bit
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
earlier we have prohibitions we have
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
paradigms we have guidelines by which we
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
as law enforcement have to function I
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
can no more walk into your house without
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
a reason um whether it be under court
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
order or for exigent circumstances than
 
04:04:37.950 --> 04:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
anything it just does not happen
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
especially here in New Hampshire so to
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
fear government at least uniformed
 
04:04:43.159 --> 04:04:44.149 align:start position:0%
fear government at least uniformed
government

04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
I think is going a little bit of far of
 
04:04:49.550 --> 04:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
what this would intend to do uh we feel
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a very wide sweeping type
 
04:04:54.149 --> 04:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
of Bill and perhaps it's even an answer
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
in search of a question uh again because
 
04:04:58.429 --> 04:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
of the guidelines that we have to
 
04:04:58.439 --> 04:04:59.790 align:start position:0%
of the guidelines that we have to
function

04:04:59.790 --> 04:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
function
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
under for 23 of my 46 years in law
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement I spent with the New
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police for approximately
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
15 of those years I spent with the
 
04:05:11.149 --> 04:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
narcotics intelligence unit which is now
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
the narcotics int uh uh invest ation
 
04:05:16.750 --> 04:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
unit and the major crime unit uh while
 
04:05:18.510 --> 04:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
with the major crime unit I was strictly
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
crime scenes I have investigated over
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
100 homicides in the state been involved
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
in those
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
investigations um and attorney Shar and
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
I go way back to the early 90s with that
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
um that included having to to do these
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
to apply for search warrants
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
Etc but here are some of the questions
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we have to answer that we have to
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
look at uh the potential for this build
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
May restrict the ability to enter onto
 
04:05:47.149 --> 04:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
post of property for the service of
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
civil process as a member now of the of
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
a sheriff's department I understand
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
something that as a member of Municipal
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
policing which was earlier in my career
 
04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
and as a member of State policing we
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
were prohibited from doing civil process
 
04:06:02.429 --> 04:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's up to the Sheriff's Office to take
 
04:06:04.950 --> 04:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
care of that so if a deputy walks up
 
04:06:06.670 --> 04:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
onto a front porch where there's a no
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
trespassing sign is he or she in
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
violation uh would that mean that the
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
deputy would then have to go back to the
 
04:06:15.070 --> 04:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
office apply for a search warant in
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to deliver that civil process uh
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
this may seem a little bit far a field
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
but quite frankly we don't believe that
 
04:06:21.239 --> 04:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
but quite frankly we don't believe that
it

04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
is the uh timely service of protection
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
orders uh this is something that we take
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
very seriously and these orders protect
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse and by forcing law
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement to go through these
 
04:06:34.830 --> 04:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
additional steps are we then denying
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
people uh the opportunity to be
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
protected by the courts and by law
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement especially with a no
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
trespassing sign pursuing a fleeing
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
suspect does this prohibit me from doing
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
so or does this come under the excy
 
04:06:50.910 --> 04:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
component of um not having to have a
 
04:06:53.149 --> 04:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
warrant but again if we pursue this
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
individual onto a posted property under
 
04:06:58.750 --> 04:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
this bill are we then in violation and
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
if that individual opts to throw away
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
some evidence as he or she is running
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
away from us what happens to that I
 
04:07:06.510 --> 04:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
can't seize that evidence perhaps
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
without a warrant and that may be short
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
lived evidence the reason I brought up
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
investigating homicides is the fact that
 
04:07:15.149 --> 04:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General office many many
 
04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
years ago gave us permission in crime
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
scene to go to the dead body and seize
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
that evidence because what's known as
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
short lived evidence this is stuff that
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
we have to take into account if there's
 
04:07:29.309 --> 04:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
something burning maybe we might want to
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
put out the fire if it's evidentiary in
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
nature we can think of many many
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
examples that go along with this and
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
finally the restriction on any
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
government uh agents entry into posted
 
04:07:42.030 --> 04:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
property would would would restrict
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
other areas uh fire inspectors the um
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
the Fire Marshals office is law
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement they are sworn Law
 
04:07:52.109 --> 04:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers they carry guns so
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh they come under this building
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
inspection DCF uh investigations along
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
with a host of other stuff we have an
 
04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
excellent system of checks and balances
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
in this state I've been a product of
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
those I've involved myself with those
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
for over four decades I understand the
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions that we have as do many
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
many of my colleagues if not all of my
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues so what we would ask is to
 
04:08:16.349 --> 04:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
please itl this bill I'm happy to answer
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
have thank you Chief um I I think the
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's intent and and they're
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
free to correct me if I'm wrong is that
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
if if I post my property no
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
trespassing and the police want to come
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
on they should have to get a warrant if
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
they see the no trespassing sign and I
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that's unreasonable because
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
that expresses an uh a a um expectation
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
of privacy this is mine it's not open
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the public if it's open for the
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
public I agree that law enforcement
 
04:08:49.149 --> 04:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
should be able to go and I think the
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
examples you gave with regard to a
 
04:08:52.750 --> 04:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
fleeing suspect that that would clearly
 
04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
fall under the excy um as would the
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
evidence um and at the very least you
 
04:08:59.309 --> 04:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
could seize the entire property pending
 
04:09:02.590 --> 04:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
a warrant but and the Fire Marshals
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
being law um law enforcement officers
 
04:09:06.750 --> 04:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
that is an interesting one however I
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why they'd be out in the
 
04:09:10.990 --> 04:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
woods behind my house um but I I'm
 
04:09:13.630 --> 04:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is how could we do this
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
in what is the current policy then in
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you if there is a no
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
trespassing sign are officers required
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
by law to get a warrant or can they just
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
ignore that and go
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
on my expectation would be yes get a
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
warrant without any of the other
 
04:09:31.149 --> 04:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
exceptions right we can certainly look
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
at past case law uh that addresses this
 
04:09:37.309 --> 04:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
in a number sometimes yes sometimes no
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
certainly uh I agree with you but again
 
04:09:42.109 --> 04:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
let's use the back 40 example is that
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
merely a fence to keep the cows in or is
 
04:09:46.830 --> 04:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
that a fence to keep people out yeah I
 
04:09:49.229 --> 04:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's no and if there's
 
04:09:51.070 --> 04:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
not a no trespassing sign does that mean
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
then I have the authority to go over
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
that fence you I heard the uh question
 
04:09:58.830 --> 04:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
about uh aircraft Etc yes when I was in
 
04:10:02.109 --> 04:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
NIU I was trained by the DEA to look
 
04:10:04.670 --> 04:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
from aircraft to try to spot in those
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
days marijuana grows um is that again I
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
would say that that's fair and open uh
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
fair and open that there is already if
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh incorrect there is already
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
some case law that addresses aerial uh
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
surveillance today in the AE day and age
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
of uh drones certainly we have certain
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions but again if I'm going to
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
prepare aearch warrant I'm going to send
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
a drone today over that residence or
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
that area in order to to protect the
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that are then going to
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
exercise that warrant if that makes
 
04:10:42.109 --> 04:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
sense in the old days what we would do
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
is we drive up we'd go stealthy we'
 
04:10:46.229 --> 04:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
sneak around we take pictures we bring
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
it back for the affidavit today we don't
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
need to worry about that we have the
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
mechanical ability to do that I drone so
 
04:10:55.389 --> 04:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
I think that this is something that the
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and the executive branch are
 
04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
going we can debate it all we want but
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
it will eventually come down to the
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
judicial uh leg of the three-legged
 
04:11:07.030 --> 04:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
stool yeah I I I mean it's unfortunate
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
if it has to I think that we could
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
probably find Common Ground um with
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
regard to the drones again I think that
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
would have to be a totally separate
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
issue but I I I believe the the oldest
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
case I can remember is they said the the
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
court said you could what you could see
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
with your naked eye or with use of
 
04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
binoculars was fine as long as it wasn't
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
into someone's home where they had an
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy but they drew the
 
04:11:32.590 --> 04:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
line at what you could hear you weren't
 
04:11:35.229 --> 04:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to enhance your hearing so it's
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
complicated and difficult for the
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
average citizen to understand uh thermal
 
04:11:40.830 --> 04:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
for example you can go up with a drone
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you be find somebody whereas you
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see them just flying
 
04:11:47.870 --> 04:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
in a helicopter so is that enhanced so
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer we just stick to no
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
trespassing again the plan View Doctrine
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
would would come into play as well yeah
 
04:11:56.670 --> 04:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you further
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions see you none thank you for
 
04:11:58.680 --> 04:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
questions see you none thank you for
your

04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
testim um chair calls The Honorable
 
04:12:16.109 --> 04:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
to the committee for taking my testimony
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
I am here representing the New Hampshire
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association which is a
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit voluntary
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
membership organization um every
 
04:12:31.389 --> 04:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
municipality voluntarily and City the
 
04:12:33.790 --> 04:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is a member um
 
04:12:37.149 --> 04:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying we are neutral on House
 
04:12:40.349 --> 04:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 206 but we do have some concerns
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
and reservations that we'd like to raise
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
to the committee um um the first is the
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
definition of quote you know government
 
04:12:52.269 --> 04:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
agent which says on line seven and8 of
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
page um I believe it's page one of the
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill yeah page one is um says means any
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
local or state official except where
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise noted who is employed or
 
04:13:05.149 --> 04:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
contracted by a government body in this
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
state and
 
04:13:10.030 --> 04:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm we're concerned because that
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
would include Municipal officials and it
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
would be very open and um there already
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
are as many people before me have
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know there's requirements
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
that you have to knock on the door ask
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
permission to go on the property If you
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
deny permission you can't go any further
 
04:13:27.109 --> 04:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
than the curtilage of the property um
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is very much a concern of the
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
assessors right and they are following
 
04:13:31.950 --> 04:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
these rules to the best of their
 
04:13:33.109 --> 04:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
abilities when they're trying to do
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
property assessments which they're
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
regularly doing across the state as
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
required by Statute um our concern is
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
that there is already a process for you
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
know those specific government agents
 
04:13:47.710 --> 04:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
like an assessor maybe some other kind
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
of um Municipal um employee to get an
 
04:13:55.149 --> 04:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
administrative warrant under RSA
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
595b and we think that
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
um that there might be confusion about
 
04:14:02.109 --> 04:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
what process they would go and which
 
04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
statutes they'd be following um so
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's that is our concern um maybe our
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
concern is inaccurate but that's what's
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
been flagged to us when we reviewed it
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
with our legal we kind of shared those
 
04:14:16.030 --> 04:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
similar concerns I want to bring it
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
forward to the rest of the committee um
 
04:14:20.189 --> 04:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
as you work on this bill moving forward
 
04:14:22.189 --> 04:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
during the legislative session and I
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
will take any
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative share um do you have the
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you I do could you read
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral nine um and and and
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
tell me whether you think the conduct of
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal officials as you've described
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.469 --> 04:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
you want me to read it to you no I I got
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
it in front of me okay sorry I have it
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
in front of me you asked me to read it I
 
04:14:52.269 --> 04:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want me to read it out
 
04:14:54.429 --> 04:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
read it to read it to yourself and tell
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
me whether it it included in that is the
 
04:15:00.670 --> 04:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
conduct of assessors and other Municipal
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
officials performing their functions be
 
04:15:05.710 --> 04:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
it with administ gr Warren or
 
04:15:09.070 --> 04:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
not um we did discuss that internally
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
and yes but there was um I feel as if
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
there was another section Bill though
 
04:15:21.550 --> 04:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
mistaken we did discuss that so nothing
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the section shall be construed to
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
limit restrict or impair access of any
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
governmental or regulatory agency to
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
buildings businesses or other premises
 
04:15:35.229 --> 04:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
as provided by law but again our Our
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
concern is that there already is
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
existing statute and there already is
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
existing case law and other statutes
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
that restrict
 
04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
you know those Municipal agents and when
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
they are restricted by the private
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
property owner there's a process for how
 
04:15:51.389 --> 04:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
they go get a warrant and so we kind of
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
find this in some ways duplicative and
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want our assessors to be
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerned that somehow they're violating
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
the law for doing their job and by and
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
by abiding by other statutes so it's
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
less of a you know I see your technical
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
point but it's more of a when we are
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislating um you know some of these
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
issues and it seems like it's already
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
pretty well established case law our
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
local officials um because not all of
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
them are experts in criminal justice
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
matters they do get concerned about how
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
they're able to do their
 
04:16:23.229 --> 04:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
jobs I would assume that after we change
 
04:16:25.149 --> 04:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
the law the municipal Association could
 
04:16:27.630 --> 04:16:27.640 align:start position:0%
inform them all how to do their jobs I
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
think that if there's already a statute
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
in place that covers assessors they
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
would follow that statute there's
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that would say otherwise
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
in fact I think nine kind of directs
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
them to do that but of more concern is
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's um so many other people besides
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
assessors that have to go onto people's
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
property for various reasons which is
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
why we have to write it a little broader
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
than than one would hope to cover just
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
the folks you're worried about so I'm
 
04:16:57.630 --> 04:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
not sure that we would be able to
 
04:17:01.469 --> 04:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
address both the the privacy concerns of
 
04:17:05.550 --> 04:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
the residents and um the assessors
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
beyond what we did here unless you have
 
04:17:08.830 --> 04:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
some language
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
suggestions was oh he did okay go ahead
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
first you can go um I mean ours so after
 
04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
hearing so part of my testimony was
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
going to be that we thought this bill
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
was more directed towards law
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement but clearly after what the
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
um sponsor has cited that his intent was
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
not just to um limit the search powers
 
04:17:35.469 --> 04:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
of um and to make it more explicit what
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
their powers are in statute for law
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement that it is intended for this
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
to be more broad so we actually thought
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
it might be a mistake the definition of
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
government agent and for that to be a
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more narrow but um it sounds
 
04:17:51.389 --> 04:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
as if the committee likes the
 
04:17:53.790 --> 04:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
expansive term or the expansive
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
definition for government agent which
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
again we're neutral on the bill um you
 
04:18:00.189 --> 04:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
know we do kind of agree I we would have
 
04:18:02.670 --> 04:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of Education um but we like
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
to avoid ambiguities where we have to
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
educate a lot of Municipal officials
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
across the 232 towns in the state of New
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um when we can avoid that it
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's a benefit to our legal department
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
so but
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
um we'll look at that language represent
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
sh you had a follow-up question I didn't
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
see okay uh representative
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
Newman do you have a reference for the
 
04:18:31.469 --> 04:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
the bill that that you say covers this
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
already and they might be in conflict
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
with each other based upon this
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
definition so we would be able to
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
compare and match what need we need to
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not every aspect of what's been
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
touched upon today but I think the
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
overall process for how an
 
04:18:46.590 --> 04:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
administrative warrant is procured um
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's covered under RSA
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
595b so you know if if an assessor feels
 
04:18:54.429 --> 04:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
as if someone is being dishonest or
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of modification that
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
they can't confirm to their property
 
04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
that they need to make a an accurate
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
assessment just throwing that out in as
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
an example because we're discussing
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
assessors they would go through that
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
process so um you know I know a lot of
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
people don't like when the assessors
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
show up to their property and want to
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
reassess and um so that's part of the
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
you know when when we have additional
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
statutes that assessors you know feel as
 
04:19:20.189 --> 04:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
if constituents that they're serving
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
whether you know people in their
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
residence that they're in the towns
 
04:19:25.950 --> 04:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
where the residents have to have their
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
property reevaluated um you know if
 
04:19:30.990 --> 04:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
people start citing statutes that might
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
not be applicable to them um because not
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
every person in the state of New
 
04:19:36.389 --> 04:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to have the same
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of the law um it does make
 
04:19:39.550 --> 04:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
their jobs much more difficult
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
especially when they're statutorily
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
followup I would just make make a
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
comment about the committee doesn't make
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
well I'll make a comment to you the
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't make it I mean our
 
04:19:56.990 --> 04:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions are not an indication
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily of how we feel about the
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill one way or the other thank you okay
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
no I yeah to your point I I hope
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
not sometimes we just don't know I we're
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
here also to learn too that's why I sat
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
through the hearing because I thought we
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
thought that this was supposed to be for
 
04:20:15.109 --> 04:20:15.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and you know now we're
 
04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
like oh it is for everyone so I'm not
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily sure that's correct either I
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear that um myself so we may
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
have heard different things um having
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
said that I think that's all the
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you very much and if
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
we need anything else we know how to get
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
a hold of you appreciate
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um thank you uh for
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony uh chairman Roy in
 
04:20:51.630 --> 04:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
the committee um as you know my name is
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh bill brigh I a major with the state
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
police um I currently oversee our
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau um I I
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
came here as well to learn uh more about
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
what the uh the testimony how this how
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
this bill was perceived um by the by the
 
04:21:08.349 --> 04:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
committee and by the uh everybody
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
testifying the the sponsors of the bill
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth um I think we've heard uh
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
plenty of uh testimony so uh both
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
perspective of law enforcement
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh prosecutors um as well as
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know the reasons why this bill is
 
04:21:26.429 --> 04:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
brought forward so I won't hash over uh
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
much of that and I only uh the reason
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
that I did decide to um testify today
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
was to just offer up a couple more
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
points to consider one that I think uh
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
we should at least consider is that it
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
was testified earlier that um there have
 
04:21:45.070 --> 04:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
been no cases to challenge uh in the
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um on this issue
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
um at least that's what I heard I don't
 
04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
know that for a fact myself but that's
 
04:21:53.309 --> 04:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
what I heard today um I think we need to
 
04:21:55.389 --> 04:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
at least consider if the reason that
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is the case is because of the way
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement does their job in this
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
state already as it um relates to the
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
Open Fields Doctrine um so it's the
 
04:22:09.149 --> 04:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
standard practice of the New Hampshire
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
State Police especially but law
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement in general in the state of
 
04:22:15.070 --> 04:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that if property is posted
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's private property that in
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
order to enter that property to continue
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
an investigation unless there's exigent
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances or one of the other uh
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
exclusions to um you know to the
 
04:22:30.429 --> 04:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
evidence rules uh we would still need to
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
either get permission from the landowner
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
or obtain a warrant to enter that
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
property so that is that's common
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
practice um aside from the US uh Supreme
 
04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
Court case law that was
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
um referenced here today
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't have knowledge of of
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
that case um or how that would currently
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
apply to New Hampshire law but I do know
 
04:22:56.590 --> 04:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
that uh in New Hampshire law enforcement
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
currently would need to seek a warrant
 
04:23:00.269 --> 04:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
or get permission from the landowner to
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
enter posted property now the issue of
 
04:23:05.830 --> 04:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
the unposted property uh if a law
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer was furthering their
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
investigation and they they came across
 
04:23:11.950 --> 04:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
evidence on unposted property it would
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
still be our practice before that Pro
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
before that evidence was seized to seek
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
permission from a landowner so we we
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
come across crimes all the time
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
especially U my experience with the the
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
major crime unit investigating homicides
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
if we had a scene um in a public area if
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
we could determine who a landowner was
 
04:23:37.389 --> 04:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
for that uh location we still seek out
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
um either um uh we still seek their
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
permission to be there and if we can't
 
04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
obtain that permission to be there um we
 
04:23:47.309 --> 04:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
would seek a warrant for that even
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
though it was in a public place where we
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
had the legal right to be um that's
 
04:23:54.269 --> 04:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
common practice of the way we do
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
business now um so I just wanted to
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
offer those things up uh one thing I did
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
notice in the
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
statute uh it's section 7 Roman numeral
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
7 about uh arrests um being invalid um I
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
would just like to offer up that I think
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
that that's that may be dangerous
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
because um somebody may be an arrest may
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
be made based on evidence outside of uh
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
just this evidence that could be
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
excluded based on uh you know the the
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
entering of posted property so if there
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
was other evidence uh that gave probable
 
04:24:33.109 --> 04:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
cause for an officer to make an arrest
 
04:24:36.109 --> 04:24:36.119 align:start position:0%
besides that evidence that was obtained
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
um I would hate to see somebody have an
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
arrest be made invalid even though there
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
was uh evidence properly obtained in a
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
case I see what you're saying so in
 
04:24:49.630 --> 04:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
other words it should just say any
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
evidence seized pursuant to that arrest
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
should be invalid not necessarily the
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
actual arrest invalid because if there
 
04:24:58.830 --> 04:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
was inevitable Discovery or something
 
04:25:00.910 --> 04:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
else the person should still be charged
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
not get off free because the because
 
04:25:05.550 --> 04:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
this says the whole evidence exactly
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
um what you said earlier about the state
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
police um requiring a warrant if it's if
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
it's um posted that's policy correct
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's it's not a regulation or law it's
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
just well that's that's the Constitution
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
and Rules of Evidence our uh we may have
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
policy that says the same thing that
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
covers the the same things that are in
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
the the Constitution but and the Rules
 
04:25:33.149 --> 04:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
of Evidence um so yeah it is backed up
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
by policy most likely I can't I don't
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
have it off the top of my head but my my
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
fear would be that I would lose that
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
evidence if I didn't do it properly and
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
get the either seek permission or get a
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
warrant well that goes to what you said
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
earlier about if it's in a public place
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
you still get it that's a belt and
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
suspenders just so that later on you
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't lose your evidence in a
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
suppression hearing because of something
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
stupid that's correct but it's not
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
currently the state of the Constitution
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
um according to that case if I post my
 
04:26:04.229 --> 04:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
property and the police go on it and
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
discover something and they didn't get a
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
warrant for us it's admissible because
 
04:26:10.469 --> 04:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
they said Open Fields doctorine says if
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have an expectation of privacy
 
04:26:13.710 --> 04:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
just because you put up a a no
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
trespassing sign which seems strange to
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
me but it's the current state of the law
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
um representative Sher you had a
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
question yes are you aware of a a case
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
called uh State versus Smith which is a
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
2012 case which uh cites with approval
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh Oliver of the United States and holds
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
under the part one Article 19 of the New
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution that that the
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
Open Fields Doctrine is a valid Doctrine
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that case no thank you
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah if if you could look up that
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
case and give me your opinion based on
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
the state police interpretation of that
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
case later just because that's that's
 
04:26:54.429 --> 04:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
key um because that's in the Hampshire
 
04:26:57.309 --> 04:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
case okay it was testified earlier that
 
04:26:59.229 --> 04:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
there weren't cases challenging this and
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I testified that way what was
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
the case law state versus Smith okay uh
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
the citation is 163 New Hampshire
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.359 --> 04:27:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
represent

04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:27:20.590 --> 04:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
question do you have any um comments
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
about the secured premises definition
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
where it includes
 
04:27:31.950 --> 04:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
fencing um meaning that even if it's not
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
posted somehow fencing mixes into the
 
04:27:39.109 --> 04:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
mix and may require the same thing as
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
posted fencing might yeah I mean I don't
 
04:27:43.950 --> 04:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
have any specific comments to make about
 
04:27:47.070 --> 04:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
that but I but if in in my opinion if uh
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
property is fenced I would consider that
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
as curtilage of um of the of the
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
residents of that property owners um
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
which would in my opinion fall under uh
 
04:28:02.189 --> 04:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
the rules of evidence that I would need
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
to either get permission or a search
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
warrant to enter that property
 
04:28:11.349 --> 04:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
followup you mentioned uh some concern
 
04:28:14.670 --> 04:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
about uh article 7 on page two do you
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
have any concern about the article above
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
it that that doesn't talk about arrest
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
but it talks about evidence well I I
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
mean I think that's the issue at hand
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
right I mean according to the way that
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is written I mean it seems
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
like the intent is that well if if
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
somebody violates this uh this law then
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
they'll then the evidence will be lost
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
for a criminal case so I mean I
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
understand why that is there I pointed
 
04:28:44.910 --> 04:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
out uh number seven just because I would
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
hate to have as the chair pointed out
 
04:28:50.269 --> 04:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
you know an arrest be made invalid when
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
there was proper evidence obtained to to
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
establish probable cause for that arrest
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
in addition to evidence that was
 
04:29:00.349 --> 04:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
obtained in uh you know on posted
 
04:29:03.630 --> 04:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
property that fell under this uh this
 
04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
very much for adding to the conversation
 
04:29:12.429 --> 04:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else wish to

House Bill 321 invite the prime sponsor
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%

Dan veu I represent Hillsboro 34 in
 
04:30:06.910 --> 04:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
Amherst thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:30:09.870 --> 04:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
present HB 321 a bill that provides
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
drivers with additional time to pay
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
fines for certain motor vehicle
 
04:30:14.830 --> 04:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
violations without requiring a court
 
04:30:17.309 --> 04:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
appearance or undue financial hardship
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is a practical fair and responsible
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
reform that recognizes the financial
 
04:30:23.349 --> 04:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
difficulties that financial difficulties
 
04:30:24.910 --> 04:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
should not push people further into a
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
cycle of debt and license suspensions
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
under current law individuals who plead
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
guilty or noo contendre to a driving
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
violation must pay their fine within 30
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
days or risk further penalties including
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
license suspension HB 321 allows these
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
individuals to request an extension of
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
up to 90 days from the DMV and if
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
necessary a second 90day extension with
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
proof of financial
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
hardship this bill does not eliminate
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
fines penal dismiss penalties or allow

it provides a reasonable payment window
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
to allow individuals to pay Their fines

be reserved for public safety violations

on time suspension suspending a person's
 
04:31:18.309 --> 04:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
license for an ability to pay creates a
 
04:31:20.189 --> 04:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
cycle of debt and hardship that makes it
 
04:31:21.950 --> 04:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
harder for them to work earn income and
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
pay the
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%

residents live paycheck to paycheck a

30-day deadline may be manageable for
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
some but for others a longer payment
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
window can make the difference between
 
04:31:39.030 --> 04:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
compliance and suspension this bill does
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
not excuse non-payment it only grants
 
04:31:44.349 --> 04:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.269 --> 04:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
this bill provides relief for those who
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
qualif who may qualify for reduced fines
 
04:31:50.109 --> 04:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
but can't afford to take time off from
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
work New Hampshire law allows some
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
individuals to qualify for reduced fines
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
based on financial hardship but they
 
04:31:57.630 --> 04:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
must appear in court to justify their
 
04:31:59.870 --> 04:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
income many low-income individuals
 
04:32:01.389 --> 04:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to take that time off from
 
04:32:02.910 --> 04:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
work and go through the process
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
especially if they work hourly jobs
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
where lost time directly impacts their
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
pay taking time off may also be a
 
04:32:09.550 --> 04:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
hardship for their
 
04:32:11.550 --> 04:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
employer as a result some people choose
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
to ple Guilty by mail and pay the fine
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
the full fine even when they might
 
04:32:17.830 --> 04:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
qualify for a reduction simply because
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to miss time from work
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
HP 321 gives the individuals a better
 
04:32:24.109 --> 04:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
option by allowing them to pay over time
 
04:32:27.189 --> 04:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
without taking time off from work uh
 
04:32:28.750 --> 04:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
reduces unnecessary Court appearances
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
right now individuals struggling to pay
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
fines must may may have to appear in
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
court to request an extension which
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
increases case loads for judges and
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
clerks by allowing drivers to request an
 
04:32:39.149 --> 04:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
extension directly from the DMV this
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill simplifies the process and reduces
 
04:32:42.750 --> 04:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
the burden on the judici
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
system uh there's a small Financial
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
impact of $36,000 a onetime upgrade to
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
the to the system uh otherwise there's
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
no long-term
 
04:32:56.269 --> 04:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
impact um in summary this bill prevents
 
04:32:58.510 --> 04:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
people from losing there ability to work
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
to simply because they need extra time
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
to pay a fine it reduces unnecessary
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
core involvement and streamlines DMV
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
procedures it helps low income
 
04:33:07.709 --> 04:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who qualify for reduced fins
 
04:33:09.189 --> 04:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
but cannot afford to take down off from
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
work and it has no long-term cost to the
 
04:33:13.869 --> 04:33:13.879 align:start position:0%
state and insurance fines are still
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
collected um thank you and I welcome any
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I I I'd like to
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
spill thank you for bringing it to us um
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
mind couple quick questions the first
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
90-day extension there's no discretion
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
for the DMV to say no to but the second
 
04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
it says they have to provide proof is
 
04:33:34.590 --> 04:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
that correct I believe that's correct
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
yeah do do you know what the definition
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
of proof is I mean it it
 
04:33:41.789 --> 04:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
seems unless we have a standard it could
 
04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
change based on whoever the official is
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
at the moment looking at it right um I
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
kind of left that open to the ru making
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
process but if we should put some guards
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
on that that might be prudent okay uh
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative rhs thank you Mr
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
chair I turned it off um thank you Mr
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm not sure if you heard but
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman and I were kind of looking
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
at this and coming up with the same
 
04:34:04.719 --> 04:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
at this and coming up with the same
question

04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
um so you know you have the
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
step with would you have you given any
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
thought to instead of the step just
 
04:34:19.789 --> 04:34:19.799 align:start position:0%
being able to with the first request
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
maybe have have the proof at that first
 
04:34:24.750 --> 04:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
request and I definitely think we should
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
probably say what the proof needs to be
 
04:34:29.070 --> 04:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't change per person but just
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
extend it
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
out maybe like with a payment plan from
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
that first time out instead of having to
 
04:34:35.789 --> 04:34:35.799 align:start position:0%
go step steps I'm just thinking of the
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
person that they kind of think that
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're good they're in the clear and
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
now the next thing you know oops have to
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
go back and ask you know again do you
 
04:34:46.029 --> 04:34:46.039 align:start position:0%
think it maybe it would be easier to
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
just kind of go right to the right to
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
the full Monte the first time around
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
with the ex with the exception with the
 
04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
proof go straight to 180 days yes um
 
04:34:59.189 --> 04:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
something to consider up to
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
yes I I would consider that if if uh
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I kind of like the the step
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
process but okay you know I something to
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
work to think about yeah I'd work with
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
you on that okay thank you further
 
04:35:15.150 --> 04:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative share
 
04:35:17.949 --> 04:35:17.959 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question have
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
you had conversation with John morasco
 
04:35:22.109 --> 04:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
the director of Motor Vehicles about
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
this I did uh IAL talked with him and
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
some of his staff over the summer um
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
they don't have a position on this but
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
some of them have expressed that um this
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
is a situation that does come up and
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
people you know 30 days is just a little
 
04:35:38.310 --> 04:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
bit too short you give them a few more
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
days and and it's fine um otherwise they
 
04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
have to plead not guilty and go to court
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and request a reduced fee or a payment
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
plan uh this kind of takes that burden
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
off the courts and gets a little bit
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
more time and the DMB can handle it uh
 
04:35:55.949 --> 04:35:55.959 align:start position:0%
in their normal processes thank to to me
 
04:35:59.910 --> 04:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
it it the issue is what is the intent of
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
the law is it you get a fine and that
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
fine is to punish you for your behavior
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
but it can turn from punishment into
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
destroying your life if you if you lose
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
license and you lose your you can't pay
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
for your car now your car's gone you
 
04:36:17.470 --> 04:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a Snowball Effect right all
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
from a fine so I I think any attempt we
 
04:36:21.990 --> 04:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
can make uh we should take so thank you
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
further questions representative new
 
04:36:25.709 --> 04:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
my question um I also really like this
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm wondering one of the things
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned is that if you have
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
to go to court so I feel like all these
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions are in line but just to kind
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
of drill down a little bit further is
 
04:36:37.269 --> 04:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
that if you have to take a day off to go
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
to court then I mean that could be the
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
whole thing to pay the fine in some
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
cases um and so I'm just wondering I
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of this is to leave to
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
the DMV so that they can you know put it
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
together in a way that works for them
 
04:36:49.390 --> 04:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
but would you object to having something
 
04:36:51.390 --> 04:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
that specified that it was something
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
that could be done um remotely that the
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
process was something that could be
 
04:36:57.629 --> 04:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
remote because I think you
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
know what I would think is that uh you
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
would end up needing to go someplace to
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the proof right which would
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
be kind of taken away from the intent of
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
about thank you for that I I agree that
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking about that myself um
 
04:37:12.910 --> 04:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
should it be just a process where you
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
send in the envelope and check check a
 
04:37:17.869 --> 04:37:17.879 align:start position:0%
box it says I request the 90 days and
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
that first 90 days is automatic or you
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
know would would the DMV Envision a
 
04:37:24.429 --> 04:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
process where somebody has to take time
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
off from work and still go through the
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
same so maybe we should specify that the
 
04:37:32.670 --> 04:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
first round is more administrative and
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
thanks never as easy as it seems see you
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you you anyone else is
 
04:37:44.189 --> 04:37:44.199 align:start position:0%

04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
this bill who has not done so seeing
 
04:37:51.150 --> 04:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.949 --> 04:37:53.959 align:start position:0%
hearing I hereby open the public hearing
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
330 and invite the prime sponsor in just
 
04:38:30.109 --> 04:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.070 --> 04:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here wishing to testify
 
04:38:48.589 --> 04:38:48.599 align:start position:0%

on House Bill
[Music]

04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
330 yeah we just didn't have a sponsor
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I see a sea of orange placard does
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
everyone here against this bill
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
or yeah okay um seeing no one's here to
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
introduce it I don't think it's
 
04:39:06.429 --> 04:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
necessary to hear all the fours if there
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
I mean against if there's no four um
 
04:39:12.429 --> 04:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
having that having said that I'm going
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
to uh I I don't want to I don't want to
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
have you all testify with without
 
04:39:16.680 --> 04:39:19.109 align:start position:0%
have you all testify with without
hearing

04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
somebody about why we need the bill in
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
place and well to my chrin I I see my
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
name as a co-sponsor and I don't recall
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
ever discussing this bill with
 
04:39:30.240 --> 04:39:33.629 align:start position:0%
ever discussing this bill with
anybody

04:39:33.629 --> 04:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would support the chair uh
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill so we can
 
04:39:42.590 --> 04:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
cross-examine the chair right I think um
 
04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
I will introduce the bill but I will not
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:40:20.350 --> 04:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative Roy Rockingham 32 I'm
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 330 on behalf of
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
Representative ol who whatever reason
 
04:40:28.920 --> 04:40:28.930 align:start position:0%
could not be here this
 
04:40:28.930 --> 04:40:31.628 align:start position:0%
could not be here this
[Music]

04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon based on my review of this
 
04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
bill it's discussing the privacy of
 
04:40:41.948 --> 04:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
and the dissemination of information
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
retained their form um for scanning
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
although now that I I read it I do
 
04:40:51.550 --> 04:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
recall discussions
 
04:40:53.788 --> 04:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
regarding when people purchase
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and things of that nature
 
04:40:57.788 --> 04:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
their license is often scanned and the
 
04:40:57.798 --> 04:40:59.230 align:start position:0%
their license is often scanned and the
question

04:40:59.230 --> 04:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
comes what happens to the information
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
that's captured from that scan where
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
does it go and why is that necessary
 
04:41:07.670 --> 04:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
versus just looking at it and seeing the
 
04:41:07.680 --> 04:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
versus just looking at it and seeing the
dates

04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
dates
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that we open that up
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
for discussion and hear from these fine
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
folks behind us are going to tell us why
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
it's a great
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
Weston yeah yeah the the clerk has asked
 
04:41:36.750 --> 04:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
if um anybody is here to F if if you
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
wish to testify if you could fill out a
 
04:41:41.628 --> 04:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
pink card now so that we're not um in a
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
last minute situation that would be
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you take my coffee are you
 
04:41:45.600 --> 04:41:47.708 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you take my coffee are you
leaving

04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
gone good afternoon members of the
 
04:42:07.390 --> 04:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mora Weston uh I am
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of the New England
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
connectivity and Telecommunications
 
04:42:13.868 --> 04:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
Association and we are here in
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
330 um necta members in New Hampshire
 
04:42:22.590 --> 04:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
include breez line Charter
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
Communications and
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
Comcast together necta members service
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 485,000 customers and
 
04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
offer their services to more than
 
04:42:31.958 --> 04:42:33.788 align:start position:0%
offer their services to more than
695,000

04:42:33.788 --> 04:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
695,000
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
locations in 185
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
communities uh necta is absolutely
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
committed to protecting personal
 
04:42:43.350 --> 04:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
information of customers and employees
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
but we are concerned about potential
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of the
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislation before
 
04:42:52.350 --> 04:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
you it appears to us that the languages
 
04:42:54.990 --> 04:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
drafted would prohibit businesses from
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
collecting and even reviewing basic
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
identifying information which is really
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
necessary uh for public safety for
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
example this could restrict the common
 
04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
practice of using a driver's license as
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
an employment credential for employees
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
who for example operate a motor vehicle
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
on behalf of their
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
employer employers or thirdparty vendors
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh can verify driver's license
 
04:43:24.310 --> 04:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
information with
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
DMV um and in fact as the way this is
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
drafted it appears that using the
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
information itself would create a
 
04:43:35.788 --> 04:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
compliance issue even if images were not
 
04:43:35.798 --> 04:43:37.750 align:start position:0%
compliance issue even if images were not
necessarily

04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
retained also it's important for us to
 
04:43:42.750 --> 04:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
note that employers uh often require and
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
retain proof of a valid license
 
04:43:49.390 --> 04:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
especially in the case where for example
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's operating a motor vehicle
 
04:43:52.350 --> 04:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
might have had a suspension of their
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
license in in the
 
04:43:56.670 --> 04:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
past we also believe that this raises
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
issues with preventing identity
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
theft couple of quick examples with
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
mobile phone accounts driver's licenses
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
or other government documents are used
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
to verify
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
identification If This Were to become
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
law businesses may need additional
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
information for identification which is
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
referred to as knowledge-based
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
authentication it adds cost time
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
aggravation for consumers and and
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
basically creates challenges for
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
businesses to determine who's a
 
04:44:29.390 --> 04:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
fraudster versus a a legitimate uh
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
customer um driver's licenses are also
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
used to confirm identity in the case
 
04:44:37.390 --> 04:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
where fraudsters covertly swap SIM cards
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
or port phone numbers without having the
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
actual device the FCC actually requires
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
secure methods of authenticating a
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
customer before redirecting a phone
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
number and and this bill would prevent
 
04:44:54.270 --> 04:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh us from being able to do that uh
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
additionally a lot of the terminology is
 
04:44:59.948 --> 04:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
simply vague and um we urge the
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend this bill and
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
expedient uh to legislate based on the
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
forgoing reasons and I'm happy to answer
 
04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
questions to the extent that I can thank
 
04:45:08.320 --> 04:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
questions to the extent that I can thank
you

04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much vague language is
 
04:45:18.910 --> 04:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
usually concerning um representative
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
Sher again in the interest of full
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
transparency Miss Weston is a former
 
04:45:28.750 --> 04:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
student don't hold that against
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
me I I think we're good on the
 
04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
disclosures for from now on it
 
04:45:37.150 --> 04:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
entertains me exactly so we're going to
 
04:45:40.030 --> 04:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
move on from that not really the person
 
04:45:41.550 --> 04:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
sitting there as much
 
04:45:41.560 --> 04:45:43.150 align:start position:0%
sitting there as much
so

04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
um I I I appreciate the value of
 
04:45:50.310 --> 04:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses as uh uh for
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
businesses uh in terms of their use for
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
identification purposes if this bill
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
were modified to limit the use of
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses for B by businesses
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
for identification purposes would that
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
cause uh you less
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
concern I I would um I I think I'd like
 
04:46:12.910 --> 04:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
to say that I think that the bill needs
 
04:46:15.788 --> 04:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
more work than that we have terms for
 
04:46:17.310 --> 04:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
example scann is
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
undefined the uh use of the word
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
government documents is overly broad um
 
04:46:26.510 --> 04:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
finding information kept on a license
 
04:46:30.030 --> 04:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
other than a name um that's private is
 
04:46:31.590 --> 04:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
awfully narrow for example a street
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
address is not necessarily private
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
information so I we believe that the
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
bill has significant issues and we'd be
 
04:46:40.350 --> 04:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
happy to work with stakeholders if
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
there's a desire to work on it but um we
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
think that the issues are many um would
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
it be fair to say that the followup I'm
 
04:46:50.670 --> 04:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
sorry would it would it be fair to say
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
that uh uh best you can tell the concern
 
04:46:58.670 --> 04:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill tries to reflect
 
04:47:03.070 --> 04:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
is uh private citizens showing their
 
04:47:06.190 --> 04:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and the information on
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
them being used for much broader
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
purposes than just identification
 
04:47:12.510 --> 04:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
purposes that's the concern behind this
 
04:47:15.868 --> 04:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
bill sure we understand the privacy
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
concerns and we work to ensure the
 
04:47:20.590 --> 04:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
privacy of our customers and employees
 
04:47:23.230 --> 04:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
we certainly understand that desire
 
04:47:26.350 --> 04:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.510 --> 04:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
you nobody
 
04:47:33.230 --> 04:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:44.350 --> 04:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Bankers Association represents
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
40 member banks that employ roughly
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
6,000 employees here in New Hampshire um
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the opportunity to come
 
04:48:06.270 --> 04:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
before you today to express our
 
04:48:09.390 --> 04:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
opposition on House Bill 330 which
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
proposes significant restriction s on
 
04:48:13.390 --> 04:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
the use and handling of driver's license
 
04:48:16.270 --> 04:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
information by private entities while we
 
04:48:18.830 --> 04:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of privacy and
 
04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
protect and the protection of personal
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
information this bill creates
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
significant uh conflicts with the
 
04:48:27.868 --> 04:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
existing federal law and regulations and
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
imposes excessive penalties um would
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
severely disrupt routine banking
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
operations that are critical for serving
 
04:48:36.190 --> 04:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and would expose
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
Banks and their customers to increased
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
risks of fraud um I'll first start with
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
the conflicts uh with federal law the
 
04:48:45.310 --> 04:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
proposed prohibition on scanning
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
retaining of or copying of driver's
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
license information directly conflicts
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
with Federal Regulation that requires
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
Banks to collect retain and retain
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
identification documents for compliance
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
purposes which are largely uh largely
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
addressed at combating fraud and money
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
laundering uh for example us Patriot Act
 
04:49:08.590 --> 04:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
mandates financial institutions to
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
verify the identity of customers as as
 
04:49:12.910 --> 04:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
part of anti-money laundering
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
requirements this includes collection
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
and retention of government issued
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
identifications such as driver's license
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
to confirm customer identity and prevent
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
fraudulent activity there's also the
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
bank uh Bank secrecy act requires
 
04:49:28.628 --> 04:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
similar uh recordkeeping to detect uh
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
and prevent Financial crimes uh
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
preventing Banks from retaining copies
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
of driver's license would undermine
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
their ability to meet these Federal
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
obligations and could result in
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
penalties for non-compliance
 
04:49:42.590 --> 04:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
these Federal requirements could put New
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banks in untenable position of
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
choosing between violating state law and
 
04:49:50.670 --> 04:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
federal law further it's unclear to us
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
whether the passage of this bill would
 
04:49:54.548 --> 04:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
result in National preemption meaning
 
04:49:56.430 --> 04:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation likely would not apply
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
to nationally chartered Banks doing
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
business here in New Hampshire if this
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
is in fact the case it would result in
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
an unlevel playing field for our New
 
04:50:06.430 --> 04:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Charter Banks and put them at
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
a unfair disadvantage when competing for
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
business uh it also poses some
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
operational challenges for uh our
 
04:50:16.750 --> 04:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
members um prohibiting the retention of
 
04:50:18.868 --> 04:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
scanning driver's license would severely
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
disrupt routine banking operations that
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
rely on these practices to protect
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
consumers and ensure the Integrity of
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
financial transactions some examples are
 
04:50:30.590 --> 04:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
opening accounts uh banks are required
 
04:50:32.350 --> 04:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
to retain identification records to
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
verify the identity of new customers um
 
04:50:37.628 --> 04:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
fraud prevention as I mentioned earlier
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
retaining copies of identification
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
documents is a essential in
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
investigating fraud or unauthorized
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
transactions and then finally loan
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
processing driver's license information
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
is often retained as part of loan
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
documentation uh to ensure compliance
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
with identity verification and
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
underwriting requirements without the
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
ability to retain this information Banks
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
would face significant operational
 
04:51:03.070 --> 04:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
challenges leading to delays increased
 
04:51:06.830 --> 04:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
costs and potential risk to
 
04:51:09.310 --> 04:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
customers um as far as the penalties
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
that are in the bill um the imposition
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
of fines starting at $100,000 along with
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory lifetime identity theft
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
protection for affected individuals is
 
04:51:22.350 --> 04:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
excessive and we feel disproportion uh
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
disproportionate these penalties would
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
create significant legal and financial
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
risks for financial institutions even in
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
cases where compliance with Federal Law
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
requires retention of
 
04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
identification documents I think in New
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're very fortunate to have a
 
04:51:39.390 --> 04:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
strong and healthy economy supported by
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
a robust and banking industry including
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
the creation of new Banks which is not
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
common in many other states the threat
 
04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
of severe penalties and criminal
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
liability would discourage Banks from
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
operating in New Hampshire or offering
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
certain Services ultimately harming
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
consumers and businesses in the state if
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
P pass HP 330 would undoubtedly have a
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on our economy taking
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
away from the New Hampshire
 
04:52:08.830 --> 04:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage um so in conclusion while
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
well- intended hb33 conflicts with
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
federal law imposes impa impractical
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions on routine banking
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
operations and creates excessive legal
 
04:52:20.548 --> 04:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
and financial risks these issues would
 
04:52:23.150 --> 04:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
not only harm financial institutions but
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
also hinder the ability to effectively
 
04:52:27.548 --> 04:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
serve the residents in businesses of New
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and before I finish um I would
 
04:52:32.830 --> 04:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
like to also point out that in Commerce
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
they are dealing with a similar bill um
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 77 that deals with um the
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
sale of alcohol and tobacco products um
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
there there is an amendment um that
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
passed the committee last week that uh
 
04:52:51.628 --> 04:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
that prevent that would um uh prevent
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
the storing and retention of information
 
04:52:57.548 --> 04:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
held on licenses and simply allow for
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
scanning as an age
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
verification um um tool and I'd also
 
04:53:05.310 --> 04:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
like to point out the legislature passed
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
a bill last year Senate Bill 255 that
 
04:53:11.470 --> 04:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
establishes state level privacy statute
 
04:53:13.868 --> 04:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
um that requires uh businesses in the
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
state to protect personal information so
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
I feel that this issue is being
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
addressed and has been addressed um so
 
04:53:23.230 --> 04:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
in closing for these reasons New
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Banker strongly opposes House
 
04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 330 and urges the committee to
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
reject the Bill thank you for your time
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much could you just um I
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
was trying to write down as quickly as I
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
could what was the Senate bill that
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
passed last year Senate bill Senate Bill
 
04:53:43.868 --> 04:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
250 55 I believe it was retained from
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
the prior year and I believe it was the
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
first bill the governor signed last year
 
04:53:52.270 --> 04:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much welcome rep
 
04:53:52.280 --> 04:53:53.708 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much welcome rep
representative

04:53:53.708 --> 04:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
Sher uh you are not a former student of
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
mine I am
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
not um same question as I asked uh uh
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
Miss Weston
 
04:54:07.150 --> 04:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh what if the bill were to include
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
language something akin to use for uh a
 
04:54:14.750 --> 04:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
permitted uh for identification use for
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
identification purposes only and use as
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
required by federal law if those two
 
04:54:24.190 --> 04:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
things were in the bill and limited it
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
accordingly uh would you have any
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
remaining problems with the
 
04:54:31.110 --> 04:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill I I think with anything the you
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
know we always like to say the devil's
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
in the detail but I think you know given
 
04:54:38.590 --> 04:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
what you've just laid out um we I think
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
it would we we could
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
um take a neutral position on that but
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to work with this with
 
04:54:46.830 --> 04:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
the committee and any other stakeholder
 
04:54:49.590 --> 04:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it doesn't conflict with
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh federal law and that uh for our Point
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
our banks could still do business
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
without the concern and the fear of
 
04:54:58.548 --> 04:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
violating federal law when trying to
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
comply with federal law thank you you're
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
very welcome representative
 
04:55:07.470 --> 04:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
Muse thanks for taking my question not
 
04:55:08.830 --> 04:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
everybody in New Hampshire has a
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
driver's license so so what happens to
 
04:55:15.390 --> 04:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
people who don't when they come to a
 
04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
bank and they want to take out a loan or
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
they want to go through you know
 
04:55:20.670 --> 04:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
initiate one of the processes that
 
04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
you've talked about yeah thank you for
 
04:55:24.670 --> 04:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
your question it's and it's a great
 
04:55:27.628 --> 04:55:27.638 align:start position:0%
question you know banks have so it's
 
04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
governmen issued ID however Banks um and
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
we are actually we've been working with
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
for an example um Department of Health
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
and Human Services um to work on banking
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
foster children that don't have an adult
 
04:55:43.948 --> 04:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
in their life they can't sign um you
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
know they can't sign that contract to
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
open up that bank account um so if they
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a government issued ID they
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
um can use other forms of ID for example
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
library cards student or um uh school ID
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking they'd have to
 
04:56:01.868 --> 04:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
bring multiple forms of ID to verify
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
they are who they say they are um so
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
there are ways and policies it it really
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
depends on the financial institution and
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
Al you know
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
and going back to working with um DHHS
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
and banking foster kids I know our
 
04:56:17.310 --> 04:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
members have worked with their regulator
 
04:56:21.310 --> 04:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
as well the FDIC um to confirm the
 
04:56:22.990 --> 04:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
policies that they have in place are
 
04:56:28.750 --> 04:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
requirements so it's fair to say that if
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't have a driver's license
 
04:56:35.910 --> 04:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of additional steps and
 
04:56:37.270 --> 04:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of additional work that need to
 
04:56:39.150 --> 04:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
happen on your end to verify their
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
identity I I I I would say that as a
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
correct statement thank
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
you right seeing no further questions
 
04:56:52.590 --> 04:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
guy great thank you madam chair members
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
is Tom prol uh from Demmer prol and
 
04:57:09.910 --> 04:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas I'm here today representing the
 
04:57:12.910 --> 04:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
new Hampshire retail association and as
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
the other uh folks behind me have
 
04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
indicated we are also opposed to this
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um the retailers of all
 
04:57:24.030 --> 04:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
sizes use uh scanning and driver's
 
04:57:26.670 --> 04:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
licenses as a way to protect age
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
restricted items such as alcohol and
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco and as Ryan had mentioned
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
previously we have worked with the house
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee on amended language
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
to allow for the scanning of driver's
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
licenses in those specific age
 
04:57:42.910 --> 04:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
restricted item uh situations however it
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
prevents the retaining and sharing of
 
04:57:47.350 --> 04:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
that information however retailers do
 
04:57:49.750 --> 04:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
use uh driver's licenses for a number of
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
other issues um you can go to Best Buy
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
and get a Best Buy credit card um I
 
04:57:57.390 --> 04:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
think those instances would fall under
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
what uh Ryan mentioned with the bank
 
04:58:02.590 --> 04:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
secrecy act um and also many of you have
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
been to a um a home improvement retailer
 
04:58:08.350 --> 04:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
where they offer the ability to rent a
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh a truck or tools um and they
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
need to use driver's licenses to verify
 
04:58:17.070 --> 04:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh the person's allowed to drive a
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle and uh they are who they say
 
04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
they are um again also as Ryan mentioned
 
04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
he really hit a lot of good points Ryan
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
um uh cill 255 also outlines a number of
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
privacy protections including um
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
requiring uh businesses of certain sizes
 
04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
to have a mechanism for someone to reach
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
out and have whatever information that
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
was provided uh removed so we think
 
04:58:42.628 --> 04:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
there's adequate protections already in
 
04:58:45.070 --> 04:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
place based on the wisdom of uh this
 
04:58:47.788 --> 04:58:47.798 align:start position:0%
legislature in previous years and uh we
 
04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't think the bill is needed and uh we
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
would ask that you find it in expedient
 
04:58:51.320 --> 04:58:53.190 align:start position:0%
would ask that you find it in expedient
to

04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:58:55.470 --> 04:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislate thank thank you very much
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative sheer uh same question
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
I've asked M Weston and Mr hail uh if
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
the bill were amended to include
 
04:59:08.270 --> 04:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
language such as use for permitting use
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
for identification purposes on
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
and use as required by federal law would
 
04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
that uh that eliminate most of your
 
04:59:17.548 --> 04:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
objections to the bill you know I'm not
 
04:59:19.788 --> 04:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
sure I'd have to see what what that
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
language looks like and how it
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
interplays with other sections of law um
 
04:59:27.868 --> 04:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
and and what the uses would be for that
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to see it before I make a
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
decision um follow up followup um I
 
04:59:38.350 --> 04:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
think particularly with retailers uh
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
might it be the case that those who uh
 
04:59:43.390 --> 04:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
who are concerned about their privacy
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
are concerned that retailers are going
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
to use uh the information on the
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses for purposes other
 
04:59:53.470 --> 04:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
than identification and those required
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
by federal law for example uh start
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
sending the mail
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
um you do you do you appreciate that
 
05:00:05.628 --> 05:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
concern I I do appreciate that concern
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why we were fine with
 
05:00:10.430 --> 05:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
the passage of Seno 255 which we felt
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
addressed adequately addressed uh
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
consumer concerns in that
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
area last followup follow up um and as I
 
05:00:22.430 --> 05:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
read uh Senate Bill 255 it puts the onus
 
05:00:27.788 --> 05:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
on the consumer to to uh take initiative
 
05:00:31.350 --> 05:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
to protect uh the use of the information
 
05:00:33.548 --> 05:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
uh Beyond its use for identity is that
 
05:00:36.190 --> 05:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
right that's my understanding nothing
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
forther thank
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%

representative

05:00:59.788 --> 05:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
Muse are you aware of any retailers who
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
use data that they gather from licenses
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh for anything other than
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
identification purposes you know I I'm
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's so many retailers out there that
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
use this for so many different areas I
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh would hesitate to offer a broad
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
statement or response to
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much you yes you are
 
05:01:33.788 --> 05:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
free to go we certainly don't want to
 
05:01:35.708 --> 05:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
stting to a to a to a challenge that's
 
05:01:35.718 --> 05:01:37.868 align:start position:0%
stting to a to a to a challenge that's
for

05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
by share rhs committee members for the
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
record I'm Rick Fabrizio senior director
 
05:01:58.990 --> 05:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
of advocacy and public affairs for the
 
05:02:00.990 --> 05:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association of New
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are the Statewide Chamber
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
of Commerce uh I'll be brief and not uh
 
05:02:09.390 --> 05:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of what we've heard um Bia
 
05:02:09.400 --> 05:02:10.430 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of what we've heard um Bia
does

05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:02:12.030 --> 05:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh this bill because it would bro
 
05:02:13.708 --> 05:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
broadly restrict and
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
complicate um the collection of basic
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
information for routine industry
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
protocols in doing so if this bill were
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
to pass it would remove the individual's
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
right to Grant consent for the use of
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
their information for its stated
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
purpose uh it's important to point out
 
05:02:35.070 --> 05:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
that these routine business Protocols
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
are in fact uh permitted under the New
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver Privacy Act which is
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 260 col 14 it restricts the ability
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
to sell rent or transfer motor vehicle
 
05:02:49.750 --> 05:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
records for any unauthorized use as Ryan
 
05:02:51.990 --> 05:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
had mentioned it could also run a foul
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
of the federal drivers protect privacy
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
protection act which also allows
 
05:02:58.750 --> 05:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate business needs in
 
05:03:01.150 --> 05:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
transactions initiated by the individual
 
05:03:03.548 --> 05:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
to verify accuracy of personal
 
05:03:06.430 --> 05:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
information now Bia understands the per
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
the importance of safeguarding the
 
05:03:10.030 --> 05:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
personal information of New Hampshire
 
05:03:13.390 --> 05:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
residents we LED efforts to pass the New
 
05:03:16.110 --> 05:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire data Privacy Act which was SP
 
05:03:19.230 --> 05:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
255 but is now RSA
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
507 um it's the state's first
 
05:03:24.190 --> 05:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive consumer data proection uh
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
Protection Law um and I would add that
 
05:03:30.670 --> 05:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
the most troubling part uh for bi's
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
consideration is the fine structure for
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
this um at1 th000
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
$100,000 it dwarfs uh what is already in
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 260 colon 14 which allows $2,500 for
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
each violation of selling renting or
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
transferring the information with that
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sher same question that
 
05:04:01.030 --> 05:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
I've asked before I want you could no my
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
my concern would be the existence of the
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal law which this would
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
conflict with even if you were to start
 
05:04:09.750 --> 05:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
to allow for certain banking
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
transactions but you'd be ending up
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
having so many car votes that I don't
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
know what you'd have left for a law
 
05:04:18.910 --> 05:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
there was a similar more Focus Bill uh
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
before Transportation last session and
 
05:04:23.788 --> 05:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
different groups came in and said hey
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
could we get this for insurance can we
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
get this for banking how about for test
 
05:04:30.670 --> 05:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
drives of cars and it just didn't
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
Advance because there were too many
 
05:04:32.910 --> 05:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
things to
 
05:04:35.470 --> 05:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
adjust if there was a way forward on
 
05:04:38.510 --> 05:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
that I still think a major issue is the
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
what I see as access liability exposure
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
for uh businesses those the $100,000 is
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty staggering
 
05:04:49.948 --> 05:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any further questions
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
05:04:58.270 --> 05:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
you is this 330 is there anybody else
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
with us um that would like to testify
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
for house bow 3:30 that has not turned
 
05:05:04.830 --> 05:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
in a pain card seeing none I will close
 
05:05:07.230 --> 05:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
the public heing
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
3:45 nobody panic I know it's hard to
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
believe that I made a mistake I'm being
 
05:05:25.868 --> 05:05:25.878 align:start position:0%
sarcastic as I make one every time I'm
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
here and I'm looking at times um I was
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking at house bow 338 to being the
 
05:05:34.910 --> 05:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
one that we just did so um I will now
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing for House Bill
 
05:05:42.230 --> 05:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
338 and and welcome the prime sponsor to
 
05:05:50.910 --> 05:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
know thank you to the chairman and to
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
all committee
 
05:05:57.548 --> 05:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
members if you just want to hold on one
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
second we have a lot of moving Parts
 
05:06:00.150 --> 05:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
behind you we're not going to be able to
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
hear you which won't be very fair to you
 
05:06:03.270 --> 05:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
so let's just give everybody one second
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
to settle down I didn't realize we were
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to have so many moving Parts after
 
05:06:10.990 --> 05:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
I asked you to come up well apparently I
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
came into the table and I cleared the
 
05:06:15.150 --> 05:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
room sorry about that you really did
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
look what's
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
happening onone on the bright side I
 
05:06:20.750 --> 05:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
will be very brief because it's a very
 
05:06:22.510 --> 05:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill for the record my
 
05:06:24.030 --> 05:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
name is Daniel popovic Miller I
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
represent wiam Rockingham 17 and I'm the
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bipartisan
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
Bill basically the bill does exactly one
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
thing it tries to align the standards
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
needed for various um law enforcement
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
branches to um stop and search people
 
05:06:47.230 --> 05:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
and it does so by bringing the
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
conservation officers to the same
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
probable cause standard that every other
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency that I'm aware of
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
is um subject to the intent is to just
 
05:07:00.670 --> 05:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody's rights are
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
protected equally regardless of which
 
05:07:05.708 --> 05:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency they happen to
 
05:07:09.310 --> 05:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
encounter and it is um something that I
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
want worked with with boobin this um
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
Bill there was a similar
 
05:07:19.548 --> 05:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
Bill the previous term that went much
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
further than this that required warrants
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
warrants to stop anybody and whatnot and
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
that obviously didn't get anywhere
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
05:07:31.590 --> 05:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable I do believe that this is a
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
very reasonable reasonable approach to
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
that problem and I'd be happy to answer
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee thank
 
05:07:39.120 --> 05:07:42.510 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee thank
you

05:07:42.510 --> 05:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:46.110 --> 05:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if if I missed it but what
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
exactly does this bill what does the
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
bill do I don't unless I missed that it
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
changes the uh standard required to stop
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
and search people from reasonable and
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion to probable cause
 
05:08:01.390 --> 05:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's really all it does it does need
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
to do that in three separate paragraphs
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
but it's the same changes carried
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
through and again the intent is to align
 
05:08:09.070 --> 05:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
that with a probable cause that is
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
required of every other law enforcement
 
05:08:17.910 --> 05:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
agency I remember now fishion game Bill
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
there repres representative saor saor
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
sha thank you madam chair close enough

and representative Pap v m thank you for
 
05:08:38.430 --> 05:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question sir um this only
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
applies to New Hampshire
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh does this only apply to New Hampshire
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
state fish and game officers it applies
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
to conservation officers yes they are
 
05:08:50.910 --> 05:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
conservation officers so yeah it is
 
05:08:53.788 --> 05:08:53.798 align:start position:0%
meant to apply to fish and game Law
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers
 
05:09:01.548 --> 05:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
yes followup and that's state level law
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement yes they are a state agency
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
and uh you know they derive their
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
Authority from the state and again I'm
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure that people
 
05:09:12.750 --> 05:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to flip through a thick
 
05:09:14.430 --> 05:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
lawbook to see what the rights are
 
05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
yes y you good thank any anybody else
 
05:09:27.868 --> 05:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
have any questions NOP seeing none thank
 
05:09:32.350 --> 05:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon um thank you for
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
having me here um my name is Kyle Baker
 
05:09:53.548 --> 05:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
I am with the Wrath and Pignatelli firm
 
05:09:55.150 --> 05:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of the New
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Federation the
 
05:09:58.548 --> 05:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wildlife Federation is a
 
05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
92-year-old nonpartisan nonprofit
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates for Hunting
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
Fishing and trapping as well as the
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
protection of and conservation of land
 
05:10:09.430 --> 05:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
access in New Hampshire um we are
 
05:10:10.910 --> 05:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to this piece of
 
05:10:14.190 --> 05:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
legislation um we have some um we are
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
the regulated community in this sense uh
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have a membership of over 55,000
 
05:10:21.788 --> 05:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
Affiliated members 55 different fishing
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
game clubs the bear hunters the Trappers
 
05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
Association um the bass fishermen um if
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
you can do it outside um they're
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
involved with our organization um unless
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
it has a motor that's a different
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
organization so um uh we are the regular
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
community in this um in this um sort of
 
05:10:41.230 --> 05:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
matter and we see this as you know is
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
not a problem that we're facing um this
 
05:10:45.270 --> 05:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
is the I think the 11th time a piece of
 
05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
legislation in or around this particular
 
05:10:50.070 --> 05:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
topic has come forward and we have
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
annual meetings and banquets and monthly
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
meetings um with all of our delegates
 
05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
from all the various clubs around the
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
state and never once has anyone shown up
 
05:11:00.750 --> 05:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
to one of our meetings saying they felt
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
that their rights were limited by a
 
05:11:04.830 --> 05:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
conservation officers um the sportsmen
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are lucky to have a
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
very close relationship with our
 
05:11:10.350 --> 05:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
conservation officers um they are
 
05:11:12.110 --> 05:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
members of our communities members of
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
the the the sports and passions we
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
undertake um we also have concerns that
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
this would make New Hampshire a bit of
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
an island um when it comes to poaching
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
um this would be a different standard
 
05:11:23.548 --> 05:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
for conservation officers in New
 
05:11:25.948 --> 05:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than what our uh Partners on
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
both Vermont Maine and in Massachusetts
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
maintain um so we're worried that this
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
might make New Hampshire even bigger
 
05:11:36.190 --> 05:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
magnet um for poaching activities um
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um again um this is
 
05:11:39.990 --> 05:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know the expanded powers that
 
05:11:41.948 --> 05:11:41.958 align:start position:0%
conservation officers have are held for
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
very limited circumstances um and I
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
think you know the colonel will get into
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
the specifics on where they can and
 
05:11:49.110 --> 05:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
can't have extended circumstan uh search
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
Powers but again um just to be brief um
 
05:11:53.190 --> 05:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
we don't see this as a problem that
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed and we have concerns
 
05:11:56.590 --> 05:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
about unintended consequences if
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
something were to move forward so happy
 
05:12:00.510 --> 05:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions representative
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
brhs thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:12:05.948 --> 05:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you give us uh
 
05:12:05.958 --> 05:12:06.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you give us uh
just

05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
basically the the reasons why or why
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
it's so
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
important that the that the reasons that
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
you guys have the I guess the special
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
power that you
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
do uh sure so one example I've used is
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to shellfish right um
 
05:12:24.270 --> 05:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
if if a conservation officer has a
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable articul suspicion that I'm
 
05:12:27.390 --> 05:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
over the limit in the amount of
 
05:12:28.670 --> 05:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
shellfish I've taken out of the Great
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
Bay or on the coast um if they're able
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
to stop and have that expanded search
 
05:12:36.750 --> 05:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
Power um they may not have actively seen
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
me put you know X amount over the limit
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
into a cooler but if I've been there for
 
05:12:43.868 --> 05:12:43.878 align:start position:0%
you know four or five hours and I'm
 
05:12:45.750 --> 05:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
lugging a heavy cooler around they have
 
05:12:47.310 --> 05:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
a reasonable articulable suspicion that
 
05:12:48.910 --> 05:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
there's more than a you know a bushel or
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
half a bushel of oysters in my bucket so
 
05:12:53.628 --> 05:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
um the ability for them to then stop me
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
question me check my fishing license and
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
inspect my catch um if I am over the
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
limit allows that conservation officer
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
the ability to return those oysters back
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
into the environment or another instance
 
05:13:08.190 --> 05:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
may be um if I were to harvest a deer or
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
poach a deer um I can break down that
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
deer have it broken down in a relatively
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
short order and it can be frozen wrapped
 
05:13:18.750 --> 05:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
and tucked away um relatively quickly um
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
and time is sort of of the essence in a
 
05:13:22.868 --> 05:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
poaching case so having the ability of
 
05:13:25.070 --> 05:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
an officer to see you know they might
 
05:13:27.868 --> 05:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
see uh you know me they might see
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
antlers sticking out of the back of my
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
truck or something along those lines
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necess rise to the level of
 
05:13:33.670 --> 05:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
probable cause but gives them that
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable and articulable suspicion
 
05:13:37.310 --> 05:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
that they would have to prove in court
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
that they had that in order to make that
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
stop far to challenge their their
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
conviction so um time is sort of of the
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
essence uh when you're dealing with you
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
know live animals or harvested animals
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
so um that's why it's important to
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
us thank thank you I apologize I didn't
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
mean to say you as as and you were the
 
05:13:57.070 --> 05:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
actual officer so thank
 
05:14:03.390 --> 05:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
oh what additional Hoops would an
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
officer have to jump through to meet a
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause standard why don't we
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
wait for the officer to testify to that
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay perfect thank you see you no
 
05:14:14.760 --> 05:14:16.110 align:start position:0%
okay perfect thank you see you no
further

05:14:16.110 --> 05:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
wurn uh thank you for uh having me here
 
05:14:37.150 --> 05:14:37.160 align:start position:0%

commercial fisherman I I do have a
 
05:14:56.590 --> 05:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
written statement and I'd like to share
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
a few other things did did you come two
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
years ago for this I sure did I I
 
05:15:03.868 --> 05:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
thought I recognized you y change they
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
sure did uh this proposed change changes
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
under house bill HB 338 threatens to
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
devastate both the commercial and
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
recreational fishing industries by
 
05:15:18.030 --> 05:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
undermining the ability of conservation
 
05:15:20.708 --> 05:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
officers to effectively enforce
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
regulations fishing is a heavy heavily
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
regulated activity and inspections are
 
05:15:28.990 --> 05:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
crucial in preventing Marine Resources
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
from f for future Generations limiting
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
officers to act upon probable cause
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
would waste valuable time allowing
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
violations to go unchecked in depleting
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
our ecosystem federal and state laws
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
currently work in harmony to ensure
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
sustainable resources and management but
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
this change would create damaging legal
 
05:15:52.830 --> 05:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
conflicts fishermen who depend on these

resources to support our families
 
05:15:57.628 --> 05:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
understand the value of inspections and
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
will willingly
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
submit to them to protect our

05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%

economy time is money and waiting for
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
offices secure warrants would not only
 
05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
hurt enforcement efforts but financially
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
 hardwork and fishermen we cannot
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
afford to strip away the tools necessary

for sustainable fishery
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire fishing game conservation
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
officers we we have a tremendous
 
05:16:55.150 --> 05:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
relationship it's been that way for
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
decades as long as I can
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
remember um I've never want I've been
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
boarded many times through the years
 
05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
they basically drive up to our boats ask
 
05:17:08.430 --> 05:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
us how we're doing and they as they they
 
05:17:10.868 --> 05:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
ask they can uh do an inspection of our
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
catch and usually you know it's not like
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
they tie us up for a long time they they
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
go through a couple lobsters they check
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
some stuff out make sure we're whale
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
compliant make sure our trap has a tag
 
05:17:25.150 --> 05:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
estate tags in it and they go along they
 
05:17:25.160 --> 05:17:26.030 align:start position:0%
estate tags in it and they go along they
proper

05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
proper
 
05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
venting and they go along their way and
 
05:17:32.190 --> 05:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much it and all my time of
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing I've never once ever
 
05:17:36.270 --> 05:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
felt like my constitutional rights were
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
in violation it's just not how it is
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
we work with them as much as they work
 
05:17:44.430 --> 05:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
with us and this bill would
 
05:17:47.230 --> 05:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely um put a strain on that for
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
one they would have to pull up to us and
 
05:17:51.150 --> 05:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
this is my understanding how this bill
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
would actually work they would pull up
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
to say my
 
05:17:57.628 --> 05:17:57.638 align:start position:0%
vessel um request permission to do an
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
inspection once that happens they have
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
to stop I have to stop
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
fishing and they have to type in a an
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
electronic email to a judge at the
 
05:18:14.350 --> 05:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
courthouse and are my day is over and we
 
05:18:17.070 --> 05:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
have to wait for the judge to issue the
 
05:18:19.948 --> 05:18:19.958 align:start position:0%
warrant it is when we leave the dock
 
05:18:21.548 --> 05:18:21.558 align:start position:0%
today dependent on the vessel in the
 
05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
guwi hall every day we go to seea it's a
 
05:18:28.110 --> 05:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
minimum of $600 worth of bait to a th000
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
depending on how much gear we're going
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
to all that would be very costly to
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
fishermen um I urge you to oppose this
 
05:18:42.070 --> 05:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill it does nothing but hamper our New
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commercial fisherman and the
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing game department
 
05:18:50.190 --> 05:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um you said that you
 
05:18:52.990 --> 05:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
represent the the commercial fisherman
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
is that like a an organization of how
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
many how many members you have we we are
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
a uh New Hampshire commercial fisherman
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
is a 501c3 we are an organization in the
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
state um our we have
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
300 approximately 300 commercial fishing
 
05:19:11.390 --> 05:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state now they're not
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
all active and I don't know the exact
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
number of of exact members but we we are
 
05:19:19.390 --> 05:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
a strong
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
organization to that point you um you
 
05:19:24.670 --> 05:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
generally don't necessarily always
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of the government and
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
in fact the federal government um
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
infringed on on your rights quite a bit
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I understand you guys spoke out
 
05:19:34.150 --> 05:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
about it quite vociferously is that true
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
that's very true that was on a lsig
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
gauge increase and and as commercial a
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
fisherman we felt as though that our
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
data what what we see in the state and
 
05:19:46.830 --> 05:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
federal data is not correct they're
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
seeing different things than we are and
 
05:19:51.750 --> 05:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
um we came together and we stood up and
 
05:19:54.390 --> 05:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
we actually uh we had a success we got
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
success from the from our governor thank
 
05:20:00.190 --> 05:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
you Kelly aot she was big help to us and
 
05:20:02.590 --> 05:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
um it was a it was a big deal to be able
 
05:20:05.910 --> 05:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
to do that and um and this is the
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing industry is always
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
under the gun whether it's whales
 
05:20:11.150 --> 05:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's windmills whether it's
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
gauge increases and now now this this is
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
my second time up there this week uh
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
testifying on trying to protect us as
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
fishermen and um well the point of my
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
question is you're uh you're no pushover
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
your group and if you didn't like this
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
bill you wouldn't be down here telling
 
05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
us how great it was it absolutely so um
 
05:20:35.070 --> 05:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it is there anything um any
 
05:20:37.948 --> 05:20:37.958 align:start position:0%
other questions for the captain that's
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.510 --> 05:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
title um my question has to do with your
 
05:20:46.910 --> 05:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
statement about a warrant and it's it's
 
05:20:49.548 --> 05:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
my observation that
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
that without a warrant is lined out and
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think a warrant is put back in
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere but it does raise it to the
 
05:20:59.788 --> 05:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
highest degree of uh of evidence that
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
they have to prove so I'm not sure how
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
much of delay that would be to you now
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to have to probably
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
investigate that further to see
 
05:21:10.590 --> 05:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
what that
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
is and do you agree with
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
that state that question again please
 
05:21:18.750 --> 05:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a little
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
confused it doesn't appear that the a
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
warrant is required in the bill but
 
05:21:24.390 --> 05:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss that it probably okay has
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
it been removed it's been deleted it
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
without a warrant is deleted and I don't
 
05:21:33.548 --> 05:21:33.558 align:start position:0%
see anything here that says a warrant
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
and it was my understanding that it's
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to have a warrant to on our
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
boats if this is passed and I'm here to
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
speak against that that would be very
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
bad for the New Hampshire commercial
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
fisherman thank you very much the fact
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we we clear that up exective when
 
05:21:50.430 --> 05:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
you the current state of the law is they
 
05:21:52.510 --> 05:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
can board without a warrant scratching
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
that out means they would now need a
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
warrant to get it to go on their boats
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
and to apply for a warrant takes a long
 
05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
time Argo he's here to tell us why
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
that's not a good
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
idea um and and and ultimately you know
 
05:22:12.030 --> 05:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
the us fishermen are stewards of the sea
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
and we want to protect our resource and
 
05:22:15.670 --> 05:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
and this
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
is it may not seem like it but it you
 
05:22:22.150 --> 05:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
know working with wardens but it it
 
05:22:23.788 --> 05:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely protects our resource it
 
05:22:26.110 --> 05:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
keeps everyone and check they' be if
 
05:22:27.628 --> 05:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
they're stuck with me all day they may
 
05:22:29.548 --> 05:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
not be checking somebody else that's
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
05:22:33.430 --> 05:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
compliant or saving somebody they saving
 
05:22:33.440 --> 05:22:34.350 align:start position:0%
compliant or saving somebody they saving
somebody

05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you uh see you no
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you for your
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
testing oh sorry Matt go ahead um um
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I do not believe
 
05:22:44.910 --> 05:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
that the intent of this bill was to
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
require um you know the the author of
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
the bill that was not intending to
 
05:22:50.470 --> 05:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
require warrant I believe that the
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
phrase without a warrant is scratched
 
05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
out to further illustrate that the
 
05:22:56.190 --> 05:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
authors of this bill do not want there
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
to be a warrant for for boarding I
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
believe that is the intent of the
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill would you believe
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I I don't I I would
 
05:23:10.910 --> 05:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
we take a vote
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah if if I may address yeah
 
05:23:19.470 --> 05:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
um to require a warrant it needs to say
 
05:23:22.590 --> 05:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
the word warrant by saying it basically
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
now says to Star and search and to
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
examine you have to have probable cause
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say you have to have a
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
warrant oh I see so I I don't think it
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
does require a warrant I think
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Saban
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
theier is correct well to get a warrant
 
05:23:42.190 --> 05:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
you you need probable cause so it it's
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's raising the the the standard to the
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
level of you might as well get a warrant
 
05:23:46.798 --> 05:23:47.868 align:start position:0%
level of you might as well get a warrant
no

05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
well here's the difference uh probable
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
cause is the standard to get a warrant
 
05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
but do not have to get a warrant it it
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's a lot shorter true but the develop
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
probable cause based on a boat that you
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
can't yes it is a higher stand yeah it's
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
a higher standard okay I just wanted to
 
05:24:08.590 --> 05:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
clarify the way it's written says is
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
that you do not need a warrant to stop
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
but you must have probable cause to stop
 
05:24:17.628 --> 05:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
which is an increase in the the what how
 
05:24:20.590 --> 05:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
the evidentiary rules are yeah so it
 
05:24:22.990 --> 05:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
does not include a warrant I saw the
 
05:24:25.230 --> 05:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor shaking his head back yeah for
 
05:24:28.270 --> 05:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
the record mat is right yeah yeah but he
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
already rested his case once I many
 
05:24:33.788 --> 05:24:33.798 align:start position:0%
times he needs to do so now now as a
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
fisherman I'm a little confused with
 
05:24:37.628 --> 05:24:37.638 align:start position:0%
what's going on here oh yeah let me let
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:42.990 --> 05:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
let me just break it down um they don't
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
need to Warrant If This Were have passed
 
05:24:46.150 --> 05:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to have a warrant but
 
05:24:48.470 --> 05:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
they would have to have probable cause
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
so that would just mean that their the
 
05:24:52.670 --> 05:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
standard that they would need to look at
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
your catch would be higher than they
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
would previously um so right now they
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
need reasonable and articulable
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
suspicion which means I they could say
 
05:25:04.590 --> 05:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
well um I saw this and this I thought
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
those were suspicious so I wanted to
 
05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
look in the boat to probable cause means
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's um almost more likely than not that
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
you've committed a crime and I've
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
developed that information based on I
 
05:25:15.868 --> 05:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're supposed to
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
develop that information based on
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
considering they're in the middle of the
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
ocean and but we'll we'll find out when
 
05:25:23.350 --> 05:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
we hear from the colonel and I I would
 
05:25:25.990 --> 05:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh encourage to keep the law the way it
 
05:25:28.590 --> 05:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
is it works well for us it works well
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
for fishing game and I'll I'll leave it
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
at that thank you we appreciate you
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
coming down again thank you
 
05:25:40.670 --> 05:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
thanks chief uh excuse me the um CH
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:55.070 --> 05:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
Enders good afternoon my name is Steven
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
ERS I'm an assistant County attorney in
 
05:25:59.548 --> 05:25:59.558 align:start position:0%
Marat County I also opposed the bill and
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
would asked to be found in expedient to
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislate um it sounds like a problem
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist and I agreed that
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
striking the words without a warrant
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
creates ambiguity as to whether or not
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
you would need a warrant um if it if you
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
don't need a warrant I don't understand
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
what the difficulty with keeping the
 
05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
language without a warrant would create
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
I think that would clear up that
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
ambiguity I think the fact that these
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
are referred to as conservation officers
 
05:26:30.868 --> 05:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
is is telling in and of itself that
 
05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
these are people who are trying to
 
05:26:34.750 --> 05:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
conserve the resources of the State of
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there's a certain
 
05:26:38.590 --> 05:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
balance between conser serving New
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's resources and sort of your
 
05:26:44.670 --> 05:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
individual freedom to go about doing
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
whatever you want when it comes to
 
05:26:48.510 --> 05:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hunting Fishing whatever and it seems to
 
05:26:51.030 --> 05:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
me that Reasonable Suspicion would be
 
05:26:52.628 --> 05:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
the proper standard and it sounds like
 
05:26:54.190 --> 05:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
that is in fact a standard that's
 
05:26:56.590 --> 05:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
working I would note that if this were
 
05:26:59.910 --> 05:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
to pass to stop a person you would need
 
05:27:01.788 --> 05:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
whereas in sort of regular everyday law
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement law enforcement can stop a
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
person based on reason able suspicion so
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
this would create a scenario where for
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
example the gentleman who spoke before
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
me it would be easier to stop him
 
05:27:18.030 --> 05:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
driving his car on the way to the dock
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
than it would be to stop his commercial
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
fishing boat which makes very little
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
sense to me I'm happy to answer
 
05:27:28.548 --> 05:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
questions based on your experience
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
trying cases is it not your experience
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
that probable cause is often developed
 
05:27:36.868 --> 05:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
based on conversations and
 
05:27:38.350 --> 05:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
investigations that started with
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion absolutely um
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion is a lower standard
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
than probable cause and these standards
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
are sort of squishy to begin with when
 
05:27:49.948 --> 05:27:49.958 align:start position:0%
it's not like a light bulb lights up
 
05:27:51.628 --> 05:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
when you go from probable Reasonable
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
Suspicion to suddenly you now have
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
probable cause but I think generally
 
05:27:59.310 --> 05:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
you'd find that probable cause is more
 
05:28:01.150 --> 05:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
of an objective basis to believe that a
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
crime has been committed whereas
 
05:28:06.190 --> 05:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion is a sort of
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
feeling based on reasonable articulable
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
facts that in fact there is a crime of
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
foot we're we're kind of focused on on
 
05:28:16.990 --> 05:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
the ocean here but this also affects the
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
land so with regard to Hunters um in the
 
05:28:25.070 --> 05:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
woods to require probable CA to stop a
 
05:28:28.070 --> 05:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
hunter who's walking
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
um probable cause that they have
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
committed are about to commit a
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
crime can you think of any way that they
 
05:28:37.350 --> 05:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
could possibly do that without first
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
engaging the
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
or just from seeing I mean even if they
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
were carrying a deer is that prob cause
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
that that they've poached it right no
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely not it would be very
 
05:28:50.310 --> 05:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to to stop someone based on
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
probable cause which is I think why
 
05:28:54.910 --> 05:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
generally law enforcements able to stop
 
05:28:57.708 --> 05:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
a person based on Reasonable Suspicion
 
05:28:59.548 --> 05:28:59.558 align:start position:0%
so you have that sort of Terry stop
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
based on Reasonable Suspicion which
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
allows you to detain a person and ask
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
them a moderate number of questions to
 
05:29:09.590 --> 05:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
um you you know confirm or supel your
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
suspicions and that's Terry versus Ohio
 
05:29:14.190 --> 05:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
not Terry chairman of the board here
 
05:29:17.230 --> 05:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
just in case you're wondering um further
 
05:29:18.590 --> 05:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the

Jordan I do have some testimony Sir with
 
05:29:42.430 --> 05:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.440 --> 05:29:43.310 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon jamond Roy and members of the
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
criminal justice I feel sorry for this
 
05:29:49.470 --> 05:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee I come in here quite often and
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
watch your long days you have some of
 
05:29:52.750 --> 05:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
the longest days of all the people in
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
the house so thank you for your service
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
very much we have been here uh I think
 
05:30:01.548 --> 05:30:01.558 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 times on this um it is very
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
confusing for folks that don't
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
understand it I we spend uh first of all
 
05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying my name um um I
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
am here in opposition to House Bill 338
 
05:30:14.590 --> 05:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
after uh having a vote from my entire
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
Fishing Game Commission my name is Kevin
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
Jordan I'm the current chief of law
 
05:30:20.230 --> 05:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement New Hampshire fishing game
 
05:30:21.708 --> 05:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
I've served in the Colonel's position
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
for the past decade now and I am
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
entering my 34th year serving in law
 
05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I've had a little bit of
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
experience in stopping and
 
05:30:31.320 --> 05:30:32.910 align:start position:0%
experience in stopping and
searching

05:30:32.910 --> 05:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
searching
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll start by saying this
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
before you make a decision regarding
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
this it needs to be I think a clear
 
05:30:41.310 --> 05:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
understanding and I really appreciate
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
the County Attorney coming in because I
 
05:30:45.868 --> 05:30:45.878 align:start position:0%
he hit on some very important points
 
05:30:47.030 --> 05:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion and probable cars
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh probable car in on New Hampshire and
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'll compare it to New Hampshire
 
05:30:55.030 --> 05:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
roadways because I think that's what
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
people are most familiar with and try to
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
bring you back to how we stop people so
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
if you were stopped on your on your in
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
your car on the roadway that stop was
 
05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
based primarily mostly on articulable
 
05:31:09.310 --> 05:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
suspicion it's virtually impossible if
 
05:31:11.070 --> 05:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
you want to end motor vehicle stops
 
05:31:12.430 --> 05:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
create this law for the police
 
05:31:14.110 --> 05:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
departments and motor vehicle stops will
 
05:31:16.110 --> 05:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
come to a screeching halt because you
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
just can't develop probable cause
 
05:31:19.150 --> 05:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
watching a car go down the road it's
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
just not enough so you stop the car and
 
05:31:23.590 --> 05:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
then you get to the driver and you check
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
the license which is a search by the way
 
05:31:27.628 --> 05:31:27.638 align:start position:0%
the minute you ask for that driver's
 
05:31:30.270 --> 05:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
license by our court findings that's a
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
search uh and then you would work to
 
05:31:34.670 --> 05:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
develop probable cause if in fact there
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
is there is a crime a foot prob cause is
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
a standard that is 51% or higher likely
 
05:31:44.708 --> 05:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
that a reasonable and prudent person
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
would uh be of the opinion that a crime
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
has been committed or about to be
 
05:31:51.150 --> 05:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
committed or that evidence of a crime
 
05:31:53.708 --> 05:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
exist and exactly where that evidence is
 
05:31:55.830 --> 05:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
located that's a lot that's a pretty
 
05:31:58.430 --> 05:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
high standard and our attorney general's
 
05:32:01.868 --> 05:32:01.878 align:start position:0%
office as well as our courts without
 
05:32:04.270 --> 05:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
many exceptions have said to us in law
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement when you have probable
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
caruse you will apply for a search
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
warrant and they only give us a very few
 
05:32:12.510 --> 05:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
number of exceptions of when you don't
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
have to do that and they're all
 
05:32:16.750 --> 05:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
involving Exogen circumstances things
 
05:32:19.470 --> 05:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
like chasing a a felon who has just shot
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
at someone and has run into a building
 
05:32:22.590 --> 05:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
they will allow you to go in there and
 
05:32:26.030 --> 05:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
search for them um the the car being a
 
05:32:28.750 --> 05:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
mobile unit and that's gone both ways
 
05:32:30.670 --> 05:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
but a lot of times that's decided that
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's exigent but but other and domestic
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
and some levels of domestic violence but
 
05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
other than that you are required by New
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law 595 to get a warrant and
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
this law even though I think the
 
05:32:47.548 --> 05:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
representative really tried to um
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
to write this so that we wouldn't have
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
to get a search warrant I I would never
 
05:32:54.590 --> 05:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
bring a case into a courtroom with
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
probable cause and no search warrant and
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
no excy because I would get it bounced
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
out I can tell you I've had them bounced
 
05:33:02.350 --> 05:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
out over the years so those two things
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
go together and the second part of this
 
05:33:09.548 --> 05:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
bill starting on line um
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
is is most concerning when it comes to
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
the commercial fishing industry starting
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
on line 13 under marine species search
 
05:33:18.990 --> 05:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
and seizures under RSA 21175 to board
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
any boat which is on a public water
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
Waters under the jurisdiction of the
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
state if the conservation officer has
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
probable cars that essentially means we
 
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be stopping boats I can't go on
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
a boat I'm not going to be able to
 
05:33:32.510 --> 05:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
develop probable caruse on a boat with a
 
05:33:35.070 --> 05:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
pair of binoculars at 50 yards I can't
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
measure lobsters using a gug age unless
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
I board the boat and physically take the
 
05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
Lobster in hand to measure it I can't
 
05:33:43.830 --> 05:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
tell if it's a female egg bearing
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
Lobster which is so crucial to the state
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
and to the fisherman law demands that we
 
05:33:49.868 --> 05:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
release it immediately we can't even
 
05:33:51.470 --> 05:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
hold it for court I have to take a
 
05:33:53.548 --> 05:33:53.558 align:start position:0%
picture of it and release it back into
 
05:33:55.548 --> 05:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
the waters that's how critical it is to
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
our habitats I can't do that from a
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
distance with a pair of binoculars so we
 
05:34:02.830 --> 05:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
would not be able to stop boats in state
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
waters however 3 miles out federal law
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
would allow me to do all of those things
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
so the Federal law this would conflict
 
05:34:11.070 --> 05:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
with federal law they allow us to do it
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
because the federal authorities so the
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
government has and many other most other
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
states have have long debated this and
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
decided that these resources are
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
important they're critical to the to the
 
05:34:25.708 --> 05:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
survivability of the resource that we
 
05:34:28.110 --> 05:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
allow that on a limited basis I'm going
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
to tell you something I run a tight
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
 I love my people I'm very proud of
 
05:34:35.150 --> 05:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
every single one of men and women that
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
we have now but I run a tight ship and I
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
in America and I don't want to be
 
05:34:41.548 --> 05:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
searched uh illegally any more than any
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
of you do and we have very carefully
 
05:34:45.548 --> 05:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
instruct our officers on how to do that
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I really like hearing from people
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
like Ward who tolerates this regularly
 
05:34:52.990 --> 05:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
and he's one of thousands of people that
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
we board boats and that we encounter in
 
05:34:56.548 --> 05:34:56.558 align:start position:0%
the woods and I really like the fact
 
05:34:59.230 --> 05:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
when he says that this is brief the the
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
officers are polite they they do what
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do to check for
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
these compliance and they let these
 
05:35:06.590 --> 05:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
folks go along their merry way because I
 
05:35:09.190 --> 05:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
can assure you if a warrant is required
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
for us the other thing that's unique for
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
us again Troopers and and when I was a
 
05:35:15.788 --> 05:35:15.798 align:start position:0%
patrolman on the highway I was on a I
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
was on a roadway I was close to town or
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
close to my PD those days are long gone
 
05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're in the woods I'm in the woods five
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
miles back sometimes or further on these
 
05:35:26.110 --> 05:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
remote ponds I'm not sure how I would
 
05:35:28.590 --> 05:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
check a fisherman on a remote Pond that
 
05:35:30.750 --> 05:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
we air stock because I can't get a truck
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
in there if I get to the point where I
 
05:35:33.948 --> 05:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
got to get probable cars and I got to go
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
go get a warrant he's going to go for a
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
hike with me for the day until we get a
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
warrant is it or more likely my officers
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
are just going to ignore it they're not
 
05:35:43.868 --> 05:35:43.878 align:start position:0%
going to do it and and they're going to
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
ride around and drink coffee which is a
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
shame and so our resources will be raped
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
and it will not take long to do that uh
 
05:35:52.750 --> 05:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
on opening day any opening day of
 
05:35:55.430 --> 05:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
fishing you find 50 to 100 fishermen on
 
05:35:58.030 --> 05:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
a on a stock trout pond and I've got one
 
05:36:00.030 --> 05:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
officer trying to watch those folks he
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
can't possibly see them all and he's got
 
05:36:03.628 --> 05:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
to see him catch an over limit to
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
develop probable cause and then go get
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
his warrant hopefully we'll have cell
 
05:36:09.670 --> 05:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
phone coverage or we'll have Wi-Fi or
 
05:36:12.190 --> 05:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
Internet coverage which again is spotty
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
at best uh throughout our
 
05:36:15.240 --> 05:36:16.830 align:start position:0%
at best uh throughout our
state

05:36:16.830 --> 05:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
um this law has been on the books this
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
is very important I think this law has
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
been on the books since 1930 so we have
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
had 90 years of judicial review 90 years
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen of defense
 
05:36:32.948 --> 05:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys and prosecutors and judges who
 
05:36:35.708 --> 05:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
have heard this law or heard this start
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
of an investigation based on theth ities
 
05:36:40.510 --> 05:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
provided in this law I am very confident
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
when I say to you that if any of this
 
05:36:44.230 --> 05:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
violated anyone's rights we would have
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
heard about it some time ago and it
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
would have changed it has been appealed
 
05:36:51.430 --> 05:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly three times to the New
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court first case was
 
05:36:55.270 --> 05:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
State V Kimble and it involved a bob
 
05:36:56.788 --> 05:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
house with one of my officers going into
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
a bob house based on articulable
 
05:37:02.030 --> 05:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
suspicion that case was upheld by our
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as being constitutional
 
05:37:05.910 --> 05:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
the their ability they looked
 
05:37:08.670 --> 05:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
specifically at this particular statute
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
20626 the next case was State V
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
bman I find it interesting that Justice
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
Lynn affirmed this decision he was on he
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
was in the Supreme Court and he held
 
05:37:20.270 --> 05:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
that this law was constitutional in that
 
05:37:22.990 --> 05:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
particular case I think that's important
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
um that and we prevailed in that case
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
that was where an officer uh entered a
 
05:37:29.470 --> 05:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
piece of property uh and the defendant
 
05:37:31.470 --> 05:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
claimed he had no right to be there and
 
05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
and so 20626 was reviewed and affirmed
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
as being constitutional the third case
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
was in 19 1973 it involved a lobster
 
05:37:41.230 --> 05:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
fisherman a gentleman by the name of
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
Marone no relation I don't believe to
 
05:37:46.350 --> 05:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
the current Marone family down there and
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
again that involved uh boarding a boat
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
checking for lobster catches um all of
 
05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
those objections were raised um uh about
 
05:37:56.110 --> 05:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
us being able to board a boat and the
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court again upheld that this law
 
05:38:01.030 --> 05:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
was constitutional that it is necessary
 
05:38:02.990 --> 05:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure the rights of all citizens to
 
05:38:04.990 --> 05:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
enjoy these resources and that these
 
05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
stops are brief uh these people are
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
engag enging in activities uh uh based
 
05:38:13.708 --> 05:38:13.718 align:start position:0%
on uh choice not privilege not rights uh
 
05:38:15.788 --> 05:38:15.798 align:start position:0%
and so if they feel it is a violation of
 
05:38:16.990 --> 05:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
their constitutional rights you can
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
simply not participate in it um I don't
 
05:38:22.830 --> 05:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
know how I would enforce you folks Chang
 
05:38:25.070 --> 05:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
the law for us a number of years ago
 
05:38:27.150 --> 05:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
involving lead tackle to protect our
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
environment you can't fish using lead I
 
05:38:31.110 --> 05:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to check for that we
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
have to physically look at the tackle to
 
05:38:34.948 --> 05:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
see that I wouldn't be able to check for
 
05:38:37.628 --> 05:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
steel shot and a shotgun we we determine
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
that shooting lead on the water fou over
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
our waterways poisons our Waters and our
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
loons um the only way I can tell if
 
05:38:46.350 --> 05:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
someone shooting a lead shot going off
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
in a shotgun sounds identical to a steel
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
shot the only way I can tell the
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
difference between lead and steel is to
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
check it with a magnet so the officers
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
go out on during duck season and check
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
rounds with magnets we wouldn't be able
 
05:38:58.788 --> 05:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
to do that if we needed probable cause
 
05:39:01.070 --> 05:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
none of these things would occur another
 
05:39:03.430 --> 05:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
very important piece is we receive I
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
averaged it out for about 3 years we
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
receive almost a half a million dollars
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
from National marine fisheries uh no
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
um There You Go sir yes sir think I
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
should have signed you up for a witness
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
you've done a great job today um
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
National Marine
 
05:39:27.270 --> 05:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
atmospheric um Administration provides
 
05:39:28.830 --> 05:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
almost a half a million dollars to New
 
05:39:30.868 --> 05:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and so that is
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
used for my officers on the coastline
 
05:39:35.628 --> 05:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
and and they get that Grant because they
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
are down there checking Federal
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
compliance I for right whales for
 
05:39:41.708 --> 05:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
lobster traps as Mr bird very accurately
 
05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
described um if we were not able to do
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
that if we were restricted from doing
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
that which this law would now prevent us
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
from doing unless we had probable cars
 
05:39:51.708 --> 05:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
we would lose that funding we'd lose
 
05:39:53.150 --> 05:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
that half million dollar funding that
 
05:39:54.990 --> 05:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
saves the state a lot of money I buy
 
05:39:56.750 --> 05:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
equipment with it down there uh we use
 
05:39:58.590 --> 05:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
it for boats and it pays the officer
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
salaries working on the coast so that
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
would now fall to the state cence um I
 
05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
can go into I have those court cases if
 
05:40:07.310 --> 05:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
anyone is ever interested in seeing the
 
05:40:08.948 --> 05:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
quotes from them but the quotes are very
 
05:40:11.310 --> 05:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
similar to what I've said the reasoning
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
for um not ruling this as
 
05:40:17.230 --> 05:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and the final thing or
 
05:40:18.390 --> 05:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
one of the thing I want to leave you
 
05:40:20.590 --> 05:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
with is the uh State of California is
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
arguably and I don't I hope I don't
 
05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
offend anyone but arguably it is
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
probably the most liberal state in the
 
05:40:28.830 --> 05:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
country the state of California heard
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
this case involving a commercial
 
05:40:33.628 --> 05:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
fisherman based on an officer in Wild
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
the wildlife enforcement out there that
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
stopped a commercial fisherman searched
 
05:40:40.350 --> 05:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
or actually checked checked his catch
 
05:40:42.190 --> 05:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
much like we do on a daily basis found
 
05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
short lobsters convicted him of it and
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
it went all the way to the the
 
05:40:47.430 --> 05:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
California Supreme Court and they in
 
05:40:49.830 --> 05:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
fact held that this law was not
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that it was important
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
for fishermen and they gave very similar
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
reasons to our own State uh cases so uh
 
05:40:59.948 --> 05:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to to before you
 
05:41:01.788 --> 05:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
vote on this I would ask you to think
 
05:41:04.030 --> 05:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
about the last time that you heard a New
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire conservation officer being on
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the front page of any newspaper or any
 
05:41:10.510 --> 05:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
news article violating anyone's rights I
 
05:41:12.110 --> 05:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
will challenge you that that has never
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
occurred it certainly hasn't in my three
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
decade of service we have an exculpatory
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
list evidence list that I know you're
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with where officers are listed
 
05:41:22.910 --> 05:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
when they violate the law they violate
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
the rights of citizens again I've never
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
known of a New Hampshire Conservation
 
05:41:29.590 --> 05:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
office ever being on it um I I think
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing this right I think they're
 
05:41:32.830 --> 05:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
fair I think they're professional I'm
 
05:41:34.510 --> 05:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
very proud of them and I would ask you
 
05:41:36.670 --> 05:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
not to strip them of their powers which
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
is exactly ly what this bill would do
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
but to let us do our job the way been
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it and uh and I thank
 
05:41:44.468 --> 05:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
you for your patience and support that
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
I've always seen in this
 
05:41:50.230 --> 05:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Colonel um couple a
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
couple questions um we talk about
 
05:41:55.990 --> 05:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
fishermen we talk about hunters but what
 
05:41:58.390 --> 05:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
about just a regular Joe who's out there
 
05:42:01.310 --> 05:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
on his boat um who seems could
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
potentially get caught up in this yes so
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm out there just for the day on my
 
05:42:08.190 --> 05:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
on my boat and we're just out
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
sightseeing um I don't particularly care
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
about how long you take to search a
 
05:42:13.628 --> 05:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
lobster boat or anything like that I
 
05:42:15.548 --> 05:42:15.558 align:start position:0%
just want to enjoy the weather and sure
 
05:42:17.670 --> 05:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't necessarily want to consent
 
05:42:19.468 --> 05:42:19.478 align:start position:0%
to just being boarded for no particular
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
reason absolutely how do you handle that
 
05:42:23.070 --> 05:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
case so and I should have explained that
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
so give you some examples of how we how
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
we function so when I go out on a
 
05:42:29.070 --> 05:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
freshwater lake and it's fishing season
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
and i' I've got binoculars I'm watching
 
05:42:32.430 --> 05:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
people with binoculars before I approach
 
05:42:34.510 --> 05:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
them because I want to make sure that we
 
05:42:36.670 --> 05:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
are looking for fishermen and I see that
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
boat and I see a family on it which is
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
quite common and so the first thing you
 
05:42:42.030 --> 05:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
look for is do they have fishing gear on
 
05:42:43.708 --> 05:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
board are they fishing yeah if you don't
 
05:42:45.350 --> 05:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
see fishing gear then the next thing I
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
look for is I might check I might check
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
to see if the boats registered Marine
 
05:42:51.070 --> 05:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
Patrol normally does that but if I'm out
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
there and I'm looking for that I'll look
 
05:42:54.150 --> 05:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
for that I may look to see if we have
 
05:42:55.948 --> 05:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
children on board and if in fact those
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
children have life preservers other than
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to wave and wish you a
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
great day because I don't have that
 
05:43:04.868 --> 05:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion and that's what I
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
teach these guys another example is
 
05:43:10.350 --> 05:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
you you are watching Fisherman along a
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
along a brook fishing fisherman is there
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't you didn't see him catching
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
fish but he is now leaving by the time
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
you got down to him he is headed your
 
05:43:20.030 --> 05:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
way and he's got his fishing equipment
 
05:43:22.830 --> 05:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
in his hand and he has a backpack on and
 
05:43:25.150 --> 05:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
so you approach him things you you look
 
05:43:27.468 --> 05:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
you know he's fished I feel very
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable asking him for his license
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
my next conversation with him would be
 
05:43:32.070 --> 05:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
did you have any luck today you catch
 
05:43:34.230 --> 05:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
any fish and well yes I did I caught two
 
05:43:35.468 --> 05:43:35.478 align:start position:0%
brook trout can you mind if I take a
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
look at those brook trout and they'll
 
05:43:41.670 --> 05:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
present those 99% of the time if he says
 
05:43:44.270 --> 05:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
no I didn't catch any fish and he acts
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
suspicious he acts nervous or he you
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
know I have some sort of idea that maybe
 
05:43:51.628 --> 05:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
something is a miss here I might engage
 
05:43:53.390 --> 05:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
him in further conversation I might look
 
05:43:55.350 --> 05:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
at the backpack do I see water on it do
 
05:43:58.670 --> 05:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
I see it wet um I'm not allowed by this
 
05:44:01.990 --> 05:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
law to go tear off his backpack and
 
05:44:03.150 --> 05:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
unzip it and go through all the
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
compartments I mean I can do that you're
 
05:44:06.110 --> 05:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to use any of that
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
in a in a courtroom
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't give us you can't go
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
into the guy's front pockets when you're
 
05:44:15.070 --> 05:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
looking for a deer right um and people
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
have accused us you know you guys use
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
your powers to circumvent that no you
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
you've got to be able to articulate that
 
05:44:24.110 --> 05:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
you saw uh Blood on the trunk of a
 
05:44:25.750 --> 05:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle so you opened the trunk or you
 
05:44:27.190 --> 05:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
asked the individual to open the trunk
 
05:44:29.430 --> 05:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
or I saw I saw moisture in the backpack
 
05:44:31.510 --> 05:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
so I had a I had an idea there were fish
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
in there but that boater or someone's
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know we drive in boat launches all
 
05:44:38.190 --> 05:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
the time and and somebody guy standing
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
there with his date and he there's no
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
fishing gear I have a friendly
 
05:44:43.468 --> 05:44:43.478 align:start position:0%
conversation with them and I get out of
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
their hair I I have no right to ask them
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
anything so you have to have because you
 
05:44:50.868 --> 05:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
have to articulate that you know in a
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
courtroom you know that Jim androy that
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to explain in a
 
05:44:55.788 --> 05:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
courtroom and in a report what started
 
05:44:57.750 --> 05:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
this conversation and it better be solid
 
05:45:00.270 --> 05:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
because they'll they'll kick it um you
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
know today's courts I think are more in
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
tune to this than ever uh is my opinion
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
and we have uh great I don't know if you
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
were a defense attorney but I've
 
05:45:10.030 --> 05:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
listened to you and I have a feeling
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
that you are we have great defense
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys and and if there's a hole if
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
there well if there's a hole you're
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
going to have they're going to go into
 
05:45:19.628 --> 05:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
that hole and you're going to have to
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
explain that so yes we ignore that you
 
05:45:24.750 --> 05:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
ignore that and and if if by accident
 
05:45:26.030 --> 05:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
you encounter that and you don't see
 
05:45:28.110 --> 05:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
fishing gear you apologize and send them
 
05:45:30.708 --> 05:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
on their way on the contrary if you're
 
05:45:32.468 --> 05:45:32.478 align:start position:0%
talking to them and they act suspicious
 
05:45:34.468 --> 05:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
that you may develop based on they could
 
05:45:35.868 --> 05:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
have smuggled they could be full of
 
05:45:39.230 --> 05:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
fenel in in the whole at a boat yeah um
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't the other thing we
 
05:45:42.548 --> 05:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
don't do that we've been accused of
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
doing is is many times people have said
 
05:45:45.628 --> 05:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
that other agents we have good
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
relationships with other agencies and
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
they take they use us for these search
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
BS I absolutely prohibit that if this if
 
05:45:53.190 --> 05:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
it hasn't got something to do with
 
05:45:55.230 --> 05:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
fishing game don't call me out to 93 to
 
05:45:57.030 --> 05:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
search a trunk because you think I have
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
the authority and you don't that again
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is America I'm not going to to
 
05:46:03.310 --> 05:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to tolerate that and and
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
again you're not going to win that
 
05:46:05.548 --> 05:46:05.558 align:start position:0%
you're not going to win Court already
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
ruled on those a lot of things that we
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
are required to do by you by in statutes
 
05:46:12.548 --> 05:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
that you have created there's a lot of
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
commercial Fisheries laws that we have
 
05:46:18.270 --> 05:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
to do uh by holding things in our hand
 
05:46:20.350 --> 05:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
and and those are searches folks the
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
minute you do that and to base it all on
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
probable cause we can do that but you're
 
05:46:28.030 --> 05:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
going to limit if not eliminate the
 
05:46:30.868 --> 05:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to check these things and it
 
05:46:32.750 --> 05:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
won't take long for things to go right
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
or and Ward explained it pretty well if
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
you do develop that problem CA now I'm
 
05:46:38.830 --> 05:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to tie a fisherman up for the day
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
while I go get a warrant which is
 
05:46:45.230 --> 05:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
crazy if just for the so everyone
 
05:46:47.430 --> 05:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
understands the committee and who may be
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
listening what is the standard to make
 
05:46:50.638 --> 05:46:51.430 align:start position:0%
listening what is the standard to make
an

05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:46:53.990 --> 05:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
arrest to make an arrest you must have
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
probable costs so the the this bill
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
would require you to meet the standard
 
05:47:00.110 --> 05:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
you would have to meet to make an arrest
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
before you even found the evidence
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
before you could even check before you
 
05:47:06.030 --> 05:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
before you could even check evidence it
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
it it twist it around you're exactly
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah any further
 
05:47:15.310 --> 05:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
questions oh that I'm now I'm
 
05:47:17.310 --> 05:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
nervous see you no further questions
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank very much anyone else

05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
now here I open the public hearing to
 
05:49:37.150 --> 05:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the spill is um
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
343 343 and invite the prime sponsor to
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
introduce her Bill thank you Mr chair
 
05:49:45.190 --> 05:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
and honorable members of the committee
 
05:49:46.750 --> 05:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is alisandra
 
05:49:48.670 --> 05:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
Murray I represent Manchester Ward 9
 
05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 20 um and I am
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
reintroducing a bill that we passed um
 
05:49:58.190 --> 05:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
out of this committee 19 to1 last year
 
05:50:01.270 --> 05:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
it simply codifies into our existing
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
statute um specific data that we would
 
05:50:06.110 --> 05:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
like to see reported from the northern
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
border iance um I pulled up the most
 
05:50:13.628 --> 05:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
recent report they did for comparison um
 
05:50:15.548 --> 05:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
I might potentially bring forward an
 
05:50:18.030 --> 05:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
amendment before we exec on this just to
 
05:50:19.868 --> 05:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
align it a little bit better with what
 
05:50:22.990 --> 05:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
they're currently um already
 
05:50:26.190 --> 05:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
reporting but the piece I kind of want
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
to hone in on here is um collecting the
 
05:50:31.830 --> 05:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
data and Reporting the data on where
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
these individuals that are being
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
detained reside if you look at the
 
05:50:38.830 --> 05:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
activity that's been reported in the
 
05:50:41.788 --> 05:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
past quarter from the northern border
 
05:50:46.270 --> 05:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
Alliance they had over 1700 contacts
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
with individuals 668 motor vehicle stops
 
05:50:56.270 --> 05:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
608 warnings 68 citations 25 criminal
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
investigations 21 arrests and out of all
 
05:51:02.110 --> 05:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
that only four of them were individuals
 
05:51:04.830 --> 05:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
that were um detained for crossing the
 
05:51:07.868 --> 05:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
border illegally so so for
 
05:51:10.270 --> 05:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
me I would be interested in figuring out
 
05:51:11.830 --> 05:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
who the rest of these people are are
 
05:51:13.310 --> 05:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
they just individuals who live in that
 
05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
area and if so um I mean I think we can
 
05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
use the data to make better
 
05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
determinations and how we're allocating
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
this funding to this program again
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
especially going into such a tight
 
05:51:27.030 --> 05:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
budget year and in a different um
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
scenario we are now on the national
 
05:51:31.270 --> 05:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
level that I personally think maybe the
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
data will help us um you know better
 
05:51:37.468 --> 05:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
allocate um the funding and ensure that
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
um we're not just duplicating Federal
 
05:51:40.990 --> 05:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
efforts essentially especially since the
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
data seems to indicate um that the work
 
05:51:45.468 --> 05:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
they're doing is largely not what we
 
05:51:47.548 --> 05:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
intended them to do simply
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
circumstantially but that's about it
 
05:51:53.390 --> 05:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:56.230 --> 05:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
05:51:58.788 --> 05:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
Muse thanks for taking my question my
 
05:52:00.910 --> 05:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that some of this data
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
is already being collected it's just not
 
05:52:06.070 --> 05:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
being reported is that correct yes yes
 
05:52:09.190 --> 05:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
so we would essentially be asking for um
 
05:52:11.708 --> 05:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
when they have these citation forms or
 
05:52:12.670 --> 05:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know the reports that they're
 
05:52:14.510 --> 05:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
filling out when they have these stops
 
05:52:15.868 --> 05:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
just to provide the information that
 
05:52:17.230 --> 05:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
they're already collecting on those
 
05:52:19.590 --> 05:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
reports thank
 
05:52:22.030 --> 05:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
you you you said originally in your
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that um out of can you repeat
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
again the numbers of how many out of so
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
many were just that part if you don't
 
05:52:33.310 --> 05:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
mind yeah um so for ohrv and pedestrian
 
05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
contacts it's 1722
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah motor vehicle stops 668 yeah
 
05:52:40.440 --> 05:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
yeah motor vehicle stops 668 yeah
warnings

05:52:41.750 --> 05:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
warnings
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
608 citations and summons issued is 68
 
05:52:49.590 --> 05:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
25 criminal investigations 21 arrests
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
and out of all of that only four were
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who were cited for illegally
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
crossing the border cited or detained or
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
I mean four were assist to border patrol
 
05:53:02.750 --> 05:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't know really what that
 
05:53:02.760 --> 05:53:04.270 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't know really what that
was

05:53:04.270 --> 05:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:53:06.910 --> 05:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
mhm are you aware that during the
 
05:53:08.670 --> 05:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
previous administration they were not
 
05:53:11.590 --> 05:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to detain people they were just
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
given a summons and
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
released I wasn't but I do know that the
 
05:53:17.830 --> 05:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
program originally came from concerns
 
05:53:19.628 --> 05:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
like with how the federal Administration
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
previously was handling um the northern
 
05:53:24.750 --> 05:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
border um concerns around the northern
 
05:53:26.670 --> 05:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
border but I also think that those
 
05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
concerns are not um as valid considering
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
the new Administration no I'm curious I
 
05:53:32.670 --> 05:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
want to know if we can get more detailed
 
05:53:34.628 --> 05:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
information then just that doesn't tell
 
05:53:36.990 --> 05:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
me much no it literally just says yeah
 
05:53:41.708 --> 05:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
for assists to border patrol um and then
 
05:53:43.948 --> 05:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
they do have information here on what
 
05:53:46.590 --> 05:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
the other arrests were for but it
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about who those
 
05:53:51.270 --> 05:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
people were that were arrested so you
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
know there's one that's like aggravated
 
05:53:55.310 --> 05:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
driving while intoxicated one that's
 
05:53:57.468 --> 05:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
suspended on registration one that's on
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
a warrant for theft you know these are
 
05:54:01.510 --> 05:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
things that you know people should be
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
getting arrested for but probably by
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement not specially
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
deputized law enforcement agents that
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be patr border I believe
 
05:54:12.510 --> 05:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
the vast majority are state troopers and
 
05:54:14.350 --> 05:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
so they are they don't need to be
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
deputized yeah but they are acting as a
 
05:54:19.468 --> 05:54:19.478 align:start position:0%
force multiplier up in these areas where
 
05:54:21.390 --> 05:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's very sparse law enforcement just
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
because of it's so um it's so remote so
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
I know that that's there's there they're
 
05:54:27.990 --> 05:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get dual use out of it but I
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
would like more information um further
 
05:54:34.150 --> 05:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
you anyone else is there anyone else to
 
05:54:41.708 --> 05:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
so seeing none I he by Clos the public

there's serious safety
 
06:19:14.830 --> 06:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
concerns by our state police with regard
 
06:19:16.830 --> 06:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
to how drones are being operating who's
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
operating them um there's been an
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to add um a couple things one
 
06:19:25.708 --> 06:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
an exemption for our press cor so that

equipment

equipment
 
06:19:36.750 --> 06:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
because we saw what just happened in
 
06:19:38.510 --> 06:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
California with a drone flying into I
 
06:19:40.350 --> 06:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
believe some type of firefighting
 
06:19:43.990 --> 06:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
aircraft um other than that it's as it

note is it me or does every bill this
 
06:21:51.628 --> 06:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
year have a fiscal note miraculously for
 
06:21:55.230 --> 06:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
some reason um I we'll see what is it
 
06:21:59.708 --> 06:21:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
indeterminant yeah it seems like they
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
put notes on everything and said
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
indeterminate this year want us to hold
 
06:22:06.548 --> 06:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
it for the budget but that what that's
 
06:22:08.868 --> 06:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
doing is it's it's jaming fiscal all
 
06:22:10.468 --> 06:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
right um well I'm going to try and put
 
06:22:12.590 --> 06:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
it on consent and try and figure out why
 
06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
our bills are all being done this way um
 
06:22:17.548 --> 06:22:17.558 align:start position:0%

I open the executive session on House
Bill

06:22:21.750 --> 06:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:22:27.788 --> 06:22:27.798 align:start position:0%
196 oh whoops and I move ought to pass
 
06:22:30.548 --> 06:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
with Amendment an amendment number I
 
06:22:31.510 --> 06:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
offer is
 
06:22:36.590 --> 06:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative um Sher um uh
 
06:22:43.628 --> 06:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment when the bill was
 
06:22:46.468 --> 06:22:46.478 align:start position:0%
heard um was brought to us by um
 
06:22:49.110 --> 06:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler again this year
 
06:22:52.430 --> 06:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
um there were some concerns that one it
 
06:22:53.948 --> 06:22:53.958 align:start position:0%
was going to put an enormous workload on
 
06:22:57.430 --> 06:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
the court system and thereby creating a
 
06:23:02.070 --> 06:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
lot of expense as well um and the
 
06:23:05.310 --> 06:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
second concern
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
I think that was the biggest one that
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
was changed in this is really that um it
 
06:23:11.468 --> 06:23:11.478 align:start position:0%
but let me just speak to it briefly
 
06:23:12.910 --> 06:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit to like and a
 
06:23:14.430 --> 06:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
little bit to hate for everybody in this
 
06:23:16.510 --> 06:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill um which is probably makes it a
 
06:23:19.708 --> 06:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
good piece of legislation it it lets us
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
forgive mistakes made and useful and
 
06:23:23.830 --> 06:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
Discretions but it it doesn't go overly
 
06:23:26.510 --> 06:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
broad so it has to be a misdemeanor or a
 
06:23:28.788 --> 06:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
violation level offense it has to be a
 
06:23:30.670 --> 06:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
standalone offense so there's no
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on you know getting your
 
06:23:35.070 --> 06:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
your pot conviction reversed that was
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
part of a an armed robbery it had to be
 
06:23:39.670 --> 06:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
for the PO conviction um getting these
 
06:23:41.310 --> 06:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
things you may think well why why is it
 
06:23:42.510 --> 06:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
important to get rid of this is there's
 
06:23:44.350 --> 06:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of things you can't join the
 
06:23:46.430 --> 06:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
military as was raised um by one of our
 
06:23:47.830 --> 06:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
members and I didn't even think of this
 
06:23:49.510 --> 06:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
with this conviction on your record you
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
can't join the military so if you if
 
06:23:52.468 --> 06:23:52.478 align:start position:0%
this happened to you when you were 17
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and dumb or 18 you're you're done you
 
06:23:57.628 --> 06:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
can't ever join the military um Firearms
 
06:23:58.910 --> 06:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
can't own firearms you have drug
 
06:24:00.868 --> 06:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
convictions um you can't ever get a
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
security clearance so let's say all
 
06:24:03.510 --> 06:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
right I'm not going to go in military
 
06:24:06.070 --> 06:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
but I do want to work for the FBI no you
 
06:24:08.590 --> 06:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
can't so there's a lot as a society back
 
06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
during the Great War on Drugs we put a
 
06:24:13.708 --> 06:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
lot of emphasis on penalizing this but
 
06:24:15.190 --> 06:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's penalizing people for the rest of
 
06:24:18.270 --> 06:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
their lives when it not need not do so
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
so I think that um it's time we practice
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
what we preach and we exercise a little
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
forgiveness um and and I understand
 
06:24:28.390 --> 06:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
there are still some concerns about
 
06:24:30.150 --> 06:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
people who have made pled down and took
 
06:24:31.708 --> 06:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
the simple misdemeanor and it could have
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
been a felony um you know and and those
 
06:24:37.468 --> 06:24:37.478 align:start position:0%
are valid concerns but we I don't feel
 
06:24:41.590 --> 06:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
like we should retain this this um damic
 
06:24:43.110 --> 06:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
sword hanging over everybody for the
 
06:24:44.548 --> 06:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives because of the few
 
06:24:47.948 --> 06:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
that took a plea deal um and with that
 
06:24:49.190 --> 06:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your
 
06:24:51.310 --> 06:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
second representative share uh very
 
06:24:52.910 --> 06:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
least one I like your use of the word
 
06:24:57.468 --> 06:24:57.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:01.750 --> 06:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh um second uh it also uh uh a
 
06:25:05.510 --> 06:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana conviction can affect uh your
 
06:25:07.830 --> 06:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
accessibility of subsidized
 
06:25:11.708 --> 06:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
housing and potentially your family's
 
06:25:15.468 --> 06:25:15.478 align:start position:0%
accessibility to uh subsidize housing um
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
so another
 
06:25:20.708 --> 06:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
