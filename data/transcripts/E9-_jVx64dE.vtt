00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
it being 1:00 I'm going to go ahead and
 
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
open our work session on
 
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
s499 FN
 
00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh I think we set this up teed this up
 
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
so that Mr Ripple would start this
 
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
session by making sure we understood the
 
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because the fiscal note had
 
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
changed and it was more complex than
 
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
what I could
 
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
process sure uh and we did Issue a new
 
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note last week so just to make
 
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
sure everybody has the most current
 
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
version in front of them it should say
 
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.389 align:start position:0%
version in front of them it should say
amended

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
418 does everybody have that
 
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
one yes okay I have it um um so I guess
 
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'll preface this by saying I'm far from
 
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
an expert in education policy so there
 
00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
are some people here from doe to speak
 
00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
to this bill so as far as the details of
 
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
the programs themselves because there
 
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
are a number of
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
programs created by this bill or
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill um and they would
 
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
be in a better position than I am to
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
describe them in detail but I can at
 
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
least walk you through the fiscal note
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
and point you to the sections of the
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
build with the fiscal
 
00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 align:start position:0%
impact the estimated amount of that
 
00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
impact uh and whether the bill contains
 
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
an appropriation and what the source of
 
00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
that appropriation is so I'll first call
 
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
your attention to the
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
table that's in the fiscal
 
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
notes uh that shows FY 25 26 27 and a
 
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
out I I I see the table I I'm not seeing
 
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
words at each each subt to indicate
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
which part of the bill it's speaking to
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
so I can go through that as I go through
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note okay um we'll start off
 
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
with the positions so doe has estimated
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
that if all of the programs contained in
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
this bill are implemented uh they'll
 
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
need three new positions at a total cost
 
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 align:start position:0%
of 351,000 in the first year 345 in the
 
00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
second and 357 in the thir but I say so
 
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
I have to stop you again okay I because
 
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm I want to track so you said we're
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to start with the tables you're on
 
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
the table on the second page right of
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that's correct okay so
 
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
fy2 Physicians 351,000 that's correct
 
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
all right gotcha but I say that those
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
will be needed if everything is
 
00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
implemented because there's a chance
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
that not everything will be implemented
 
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
the reason this fiscal note was updated
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
last week is because the most recent
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment contained contingency
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
language uh saying that if the
 
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the various for three
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the provisions are insufficient uh
 
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
the department can delay implementation
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
of those programs um so that brings us
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
to the next component breakfast after
 
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
with section two of the bill on page one
 
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
starting on 19 addresses the breakfast
 
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
after the Bell program and the
 
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
statistics that need to be kept in order
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
to uh determine whether School District
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
should participate in that program okay
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
so you said section two line 19 I think
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh on page two or page one page one
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
believe and really the new language is
 
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
only on the bottom of page
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
one okay I'm just I'm just going really
 
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.350 align:start position:0%
one okay I'm just I'm just going really
slowly

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure and this is one of those instances
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
in which the contingency language added
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
by the Senate would apply so you'll
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
notice in the table under contains
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation it says there there's an
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
appropriation of $1 in general funds and
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
an open warrant for federal
 
00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.629 align:start position:0%
an open warrant for federal
funds

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
um so this table reflects the state
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
share of costs there's a related Federal
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
share but most of these appropriations
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
of federal funds assume the federal
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
funds will be able to cover the state
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
share in the event that that isn't
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
possible and it may not be uh the
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
department would be able to suspend
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
implementation of the
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
programs and I say it may not be
 
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
possible because generally speaking uh
 
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds can't be used to match
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
other federal
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
funds so this is one of three Provisions
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
that may not be able to be implemented
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
but again I'll let the department speak
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
so I just want to bring representative
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
flury up to
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
speed okay so we're on
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
499 and Mr Ripple has begun to walk us
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
through the the new fiscal note the new
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is a separate document as
 
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.350 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is a separate document as
amended

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.070 align:start position:0%
amended
18

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
18
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
April and we're on page two we're on
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
line two he was just talking about
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the bell and and I and I
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
already need to go back and correct
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
myself because breakfast after the Bell
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
actually is in section one not section
 
00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
two section one is it still line 19 or
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
is it a different line now it's from
 
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
line one through line
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
good okay wait a second um go ahead
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
question the the um the the first the
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
first box that says positions what what
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
section in the bill is that there is no
 
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
section those are the positions that Doe
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
estimates would be necessary to
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
implement the bill but the bill doesn't
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
actually authorize them okay thank
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
you so the actual number of positions as
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
I understand it representative Buco and
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm checking with Mr Ripple while I
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
say this is that that's kind of the
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
maximum number of positions that would
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
be authorized if the bill was fully
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
implemented in accordance with the
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
Senate language if for any reason any of
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
these sections are not implemented then
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
that position count would be reduced to
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
some number that we don't now
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
understand yes thank you is that right
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding but I'll let doe
 
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong okay go ahead
 
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
follow up what what are the number of
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
positions if it's fully implemented that
 
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
would be the three new positions uh
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
program specialist for labor grade
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
25 again they're not established in the
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
bill itself they're what the department
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
says they would need and they're that's
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
referenced in the paragraph above the
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
table in the fiscal note oh okay thank
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%

bill somewhere no okay so thank you for
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
pointing out that paragraph because
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%

statistics for breakfast lunch uh that
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
one beginning on line
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
19 okay page
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
one uh question Jr or representative H
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um so back to the table on
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
page whatever we're up to um if the
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell is currently
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
funded at a dollar but the cost was 3.7
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
million right is that going to be
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
changed to being 3.7 million because I
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
believe that's where the contingency
 
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
language would kick in the appropriation
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
would be insufficient and so the
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
department would not need to implement
 
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
you and same thing for the breakfast
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
program and the statistics you can see
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
again there's a dollar general fund
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation and an open warrant for
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds and the contingency
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
language would apply in this case as
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
well and and the basic explanation of
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
why the cost is in
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
terminable I'll I'll have to let the
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
department speak to that
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay so the next section in the table is
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit different because this is
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
the one doe piece that does contain a
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation uh this is
 
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
the reduced price lunch program and this
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
found on page two of the bill it's the
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
and this contains an open warrant for
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
the general funds needed to implement
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
the program and as you can see from the
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
table doe estimates that at just shy of
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
year okay so moving on to the next item
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
online applications and uh the community
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility provision for participating
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
on page two uh the online applications
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
are from lines 21 through
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
29 and the community eligibility
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
provision I'm sorry 20 lines 21 through
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
32 and the community eligibility
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
provision is from line 33 through
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
five and that Community eligibility
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
provision does have a pretty big
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
estimated cost of about 7.6 million per
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
year again this is one of those sections
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
with a dollar general fund appropriation
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
and an open warrant for federal funds
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
with the contingency language if the
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
okay this this table that you just
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
highlighted I think I think we're down
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
to just summarizing with the state share
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
total of 12 million 121 okay so um is
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
there something in the writeup that
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
describes how much of it is is kind of
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
like doe money versus DHHS money this is
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
all these are all doe programs the HHS
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
money is covered in the second table of
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal node this well this was the
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
second this was the third table we just
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
talked about so the second table is on
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
page one isn't it well which table you
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
so the table with the grade out section
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
in fy2 the longer one yeah that's the
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
doe piece got it and then on the final
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
page of the fiscal note there's a
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent hle thank you um I'm
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
not sure if this question is for you for
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
our chairman of Finance overall or for
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple so is it possible if we do
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
another one of these fiscal notes that
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
we identify the tables relative so we
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
can sure that great follow up and then
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
what happens in the event where we fund
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
these different programs at $1 and count
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
on federal money to come in we so we've
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
established something but have right but
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
we don't have the funds available has
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
the doe given us any insight on what
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
happens to that program is it installed
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
postponed what do we know I don't know I
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
think doe would be able to speak to that
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions are
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
are you do you need to do something
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
similar I'm sorry representative
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
Wier so there's also going to be a huge
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
cost for every local school district
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
it's indeterminant according to this
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's an indeterminable cost for local
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
school districts my understanding is
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
that that's mainly due to administrative
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
startup um but once again I would defer
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
to the department for a more in-depth
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
explanation there might be a school
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
district that doesn't do any breakfast
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
now and now we're telling them they must
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
do it that puts a whole new staff there
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
early and you know is that going to be
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
paid for by local taxpayers it's going
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
to be paid for through this bill which
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
is indeterminate which
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
could be three or four times the 12
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
million which I'm reluctant to to pay
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
for anything with that's so
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
indeterminate that who knows what it
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
would be especially when you go to the
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
summer uh feeding program there there's
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of loose ends in this as I see it
 
00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:19.629 align:start position:0%
a lot of loose ends in this as I see it
thank

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
you so so doe will come up next and
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
we'll plow into those details so so M Mr
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
Ripple on on the last page the DHHS
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
table M do do you see any need to um to
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
walk us through that or is that pretty
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory I don't think so it's
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
pretty self-explanatory this is a
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
combination of the two programs
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
established by the bill uh
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
the online elderly application uh so
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
this one contains an open-ended
 
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.590 align:start position:0%
this one contains an open-ended
appropriation

00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so as you can see HHS estimates the
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
state share at 1.2 million in the first
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
year and that would be covered by the
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation section I will just go
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
back to the doe table for a second and
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at the bottom line and
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the total cost is estim
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
if everything is implemented is
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
estimated at 12 million in fiscal 25 but
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
again the only piece that's actually
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
funded with a general fund
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation um is the reduced price
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
lunch component at just shy of a half a
 
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:37.710 align:start position:0%
lunch component at just shy of a half a
million

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
um representative em yes Mr Ripple are
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
these additive or is is HHS contained
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
within the doe HHS is not contained
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
within the doe they're separate but if
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
you look at the first page of the fiscal
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
note that
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
1.6 million general fund cost in fiscal
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
25 that's the combination of the two
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
you okay you just said it so I'm going
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
to frustrate you by asking you to repeat
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
yourself I think the the two the two
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
tables that are on page one with lots of
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
these sorry the the table that we
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
include in every fiscal note shows the
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
revenue expenditure and appropri ration
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
impact there's no revenue from any of
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
these Provisions uh but there would be
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
an estimated $1.6 million general fund
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
expenditure in 25 and that's the
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
combination of the doe and HHS
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
pieces um I say indeterminable federal
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
funds because again it comes down to
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
whether federal funds can actually be
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
used for the various new programs that
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
are established within
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
doe um and going down to the
 
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.829 align:start position:0%
doe um and going down to the
appropriation

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
box there's a general fund appropriation
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
equal to what 1.6
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
million all right do do you think that
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
concludes your review of the fiscal note
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
I do okay are there any okay so we're
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to first make sure we all
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
understand the fiscal note before we
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
start going onto the next level are
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
there any questions for Mr Ripple
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
regarding the fiscal
 
00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.510 align:start position:0%
regarding the fiscal
note

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
represent thank you chairman thank you
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions um would it be
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
fair to say that while fiscal fiscal
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
note reflects your best efforts to
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate there are still a lot of
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and unknown items
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
there I think that's true there are
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
quite a few unknowns thank
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chair so um again I'm
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
not sure who the question is for since
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
this is my just address it to the chair
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
then first first term on finance right
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
we're we're funding a program that
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
potentially is $12 million and with a
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's 1.6 million that
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
would be actually allocated toward
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
that and then how do how do the local
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
townships and schools and the state doe
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
and anybody else impacted by this
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
program know what to do what what's the
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
guidance to them at the state level if
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
we haven't funded the
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
program I I think that's going to be a
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
great question and I think we're going
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
to wait for doee and have you ask it
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
again sure okay right now we're just
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we understand the
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
the money piece of this and and I'm I'm
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
still frankly a little bit confused I'm
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
going to have to sit down later and just
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
go over it and try to figure out what
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
was just said but uh all this education
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
stuff I'm not smart
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
enough so thank thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you said that because there was
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple said that that the total the
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
doe box there was
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
12,188 right
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
and and then it was going to subtract
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
that 499,000 out of the reduced Launch
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
Box I I think it was the other way
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
around of of that 121 the only part of
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
it that is for certain at this point is
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the 500,000 the 499 and
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
change is that right yes that's correct
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
okay I had it backwards yeah well I got
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
it right I still don't understand it but
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh are any other questions
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
from the staff or excuse me from the
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
committee I just want to confirm go
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
ahead I just want to confirm these are
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
all incremental
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
correct all right uh not seeing any
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
other questions do our doe
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
and and I'll I'll start with a question
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
is is is is what you're going to tell us
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
is it um does does your
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner support this bill or are
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
you just here to provide information uh
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Melissa white division
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
director for learner support um the
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
department doesn't uh is neutral on the
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation we're just here to
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
provide the facts on what the
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
implementation would be and what we'd
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
actually be able to do um based on the
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
language that's proposed in this all
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
right so so now you're unhindered tell
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
us what you want us to know um so we
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that the programs
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
where there's a dollar of General
 
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.590 align:start position:0%
where there's a dollar of General
funds

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated we would not be able to
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
implement those programs at all so
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
putting them into legislation we would
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
need some clarification on how we're
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to move forward why wouldn't we
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
just delete those delete the lines so
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
that those dollar indeterminant wouldn't
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why they're still in
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
there do you understand there's a reason
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're still in there sure I'm not sure
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
as to why that is still in there but I
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
do want to be clear there all of the
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we have at our
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
disposal to utilize for any of our food
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
and nutrition programs are completely
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
being utilized and so uh a breakfast
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
after the Bell program that is a state
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
program we could not utilize our federal
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
funds to operate that because there are
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
no federal funds to operate that
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
particular program so I just want to be
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
clear that we would not be able to move
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
forward with that um with the other
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
um programs as far as the uh c as
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
well again we've given an estimate based
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
on if all of our schools that are
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
eligible participated and if they did
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state would be the 7.
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
six million but again there are no other
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
federal funds because the feds are
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
already paying for that other percentage
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
for those C programs so so as an
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
administrative note I I'm I'm I I open
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
this as the chairman it's a joint
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
session because we're into a policy area
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
I'm unfamiliar with I'm I'm going to
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
turn the gavl over to the chair of
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
division two and let him direct the
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
questions the handoff but the reduced
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
$499,450 system to identify those
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
students therefore it would be um much
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
easier for us to implement we wouldn't
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
need additional staff necessarily to
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
implement that piece of the proposed
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so just wanted to clarify
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
but for the other programs the breakfast
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
after the Bell the online application
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
program The Breakfast program statistics
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
for breakfast and lunch all of those
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
other pieces the C we would need those
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
three positions in order to be able to
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
implement those programs those are State
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
programs those are not federal programs
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
therefore we have to have state funded
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
positions in order to operate those
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
programs we couldn't use federal funds
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
for that so what we have here is a is
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a fruit
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
basket you know pick your which one you
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
want and we're either funding in or
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
we're not but this is all for summer
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
feeding program no I think this is for a
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
year round
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
the the DHHS portion with the
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
pebt that's kind of separate from what
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at with the Shaded table
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
that just has the doe component to it so
 
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm focusing on so this is
 
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.230 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm focusing on so this is
year

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
round um this is school year is my
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.830 align:start position:0%
 
year

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
yikes no really
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%

school year and the HHS piece is for a
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
continuation of those benefits during
 
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.230 align:start position:0%
continuation of those benefits during
the

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%

Clarity please continue I I'll try not
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you I wondered if you
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
could go back for just a minute and talk
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
about breakfast after the Bell don't we
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
all we we do serve breakfast in a number
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
of schools and are they reimbursed with
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
federal funds for those breakfasts that
 
00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.549 align:start position:0%
federal funds for those breakfasts that
are

00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
served thank you for the question um
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
just for reference Kelly Rambo Bureau
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
administrator for wellness and nutrition
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
at the department um that is correct
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
they are reimbursed by the um the
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
federal government for that there's also
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
some State funds that are that are paid
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
in that um there are currently 29
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
schools that do not operate um breakfast
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the um in the bill it is referencing
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell um so that's an
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
additional um means for students to
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
possibly get breakfast if they might
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
have been late school or um something
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
along those lines that they missed their
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity during when breakfast was
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
served so that's what the um that's what
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
that program is for um and so the bill
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
speaks to um the department reimbursing
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
for the equipment costs to start and
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
operate that um and the reason that um
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
we have included that in there is um for
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal note is so that the
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee is aware of how much that
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
could possibly cost um because currently
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
the department does not keep statistics
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
on who operates breakfast after the
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
so presently we do provide Lun breakfast
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
for for children in all but 29
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
schools we provide breakfast in
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
459 it's 29 that that do not partip
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
participate currently um in that program
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
correct okay and but we can't the
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
federal government won't allow us to
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
provide that me that lunch that
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
breakfast after school starts I mean is
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying is it just
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
because we call it this breakfast after
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
the Bell or if we called it something
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
different could it be reimbursed by the
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
federal government so just for
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
clarification those meals that are
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
served after the bill are reimbursed by
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government what is being
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
spoken about in this bill is to give
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
those locations that do not currently
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
have that program in place because
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a requirement um to give them
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
the the startup costs for the equipment
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to um reach students
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
that might not have been able to get
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
breakfast during the time that the um
 
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
breakfast during the time that the um
School

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
had designated for that okay so could
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
could I ask keep going you're you're
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
you're doing very well okay so what we
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
see in the bill is really the
 
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.029 align:start position:0%
see in the bill is really the
$3.7

00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
$3.7
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
million is for equipment that's correct
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's not for any sorts of meal for the
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
child it's not buying food it's for
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
equipment that's correct that's what is
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
being requested in the bill and for only
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
those 29
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
schools no so the um as previously
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
stated the the department does not have
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
statistics on who operates currently a
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell program so in
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
order to be fair and Equitable we would
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
need to provide to all of the locations
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are current this opportunity to all
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
of those locations that are currently
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
serving breakfast um so that's where the
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
3.7 um had come from for the equipment
 
00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:58.350 align:start position:0%
3.7 um had come from for the equipment
purchases

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
there could be some schools that are
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
currently participating and wouldn't
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
need those funds but we need to make
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we made the committee aware of
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
if they are not what the the possible
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
cost could
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
be could if we are requiring in
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for them to offer
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
this could I just ask one more question
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
have you done have you done some sort of
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
an estimate of what you think it would
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
cost a school that is not presently
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
doing breakfast what it would cost a
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
school to um have enough equipment to do
 
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.389 align:start position:0%
school to um have enough equipment to do
the

00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
program so our estimate for just
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
equipment was about
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
$155,000 could be up to a $155,000
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
depending on holding temperature um all
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
of those sorts of things um one thing to
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
also consider and that we we did put in
 
00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
um in the fiscal note was that startup
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
costs to a school are indeterminable
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
mostly because because we don't know if
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
they currently have staff to provide um
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
a breakfast program and what those other
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
costs would be to the local level so
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
that's not those aren't statistics that
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
we have at the department and that's why
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
um that was
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
indeterminable good thank you
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative wer thank you Mr
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to know the total
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
amount that gets spent for the whole
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
nutrition program and how what
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
so for for reference for last year there
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
was around $50 million that was pushed
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
out in federal
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
funds from the
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of the best way to
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
to give you that particular number um
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I might need to um do a little bit
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
more um research on that if that's
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
possible the other portion of it um one
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
thing to consider is that every school
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
district it's a local level decision on
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
what they're charging for meal pricing
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
um so it just might take a little bit
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
more to to figure um that portion out
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
for you that piece of it I thought I had
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
seen it in the education budget and as I
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
recall there was a maintenance of effort
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
so this fixed amount of money that we've
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
been contributing for years stayed fixed
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
but the total cost kept going up and the
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
feds were covering it am I
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
correct so the amount that is in there
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
is what the state is covering for the
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
reduced price
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
breakfast um and that is the the portion
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
that I believe is in um the budget that
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about you know I'm I'm
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
interested in the whole the the total
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
cost of the nutrition
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
program that's funded by the feds and we
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
put in a certain amount and my
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
recollection is they pay most of it that
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
is correct they do pay most of it and I
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
will get you um all right right correct
 
00:32:20.679 --> 00:32:21.509 align:start position:0%
will get you um all right right correct
thank

00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
H thank
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
you um I have questions so on the
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell there's the 3.7
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
million startup
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
costs we don't anticipate that to go any
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
after the first year that is truly just
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
startup costs
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question um
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
is if every school
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
participated that's what it would be if
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
some schools don't participate that cost
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
could go to the next year and that's why
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
that is um those previous previous years
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
are are indeterminable um we would need
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
to work on a procedure processes on how
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
to um to reimburse those funds so um
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's also why we would need some
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing to to do that as
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
well too followup so so in the fiscal
 
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
note that I see the first year right it
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't discuss anything about beyond
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
the startup costs the actual cost for
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
the meals and anything else is that
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
above and beyond on the 3.7 million so
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
if there's food right if the 3.7 million
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
is the food out is the infrastructure
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
costs is there not also a cost for the
 
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:39.269 align:start position:0%
costs is there not also a cost for the
meals

00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and that would be at the
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
local level that cost would be um so the
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
the bill speaks to the department just
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
um being responsible for the equipment
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so that's the number that
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
we have given in the fiscal note one
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
last question oh go for it so do we have
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
any any information on all of the
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
breakfast programs relative to food
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
usage versus spoilage
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
right that is not data that we currently
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
collect that would be at the local level
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
is there any way you can request that I
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
mean if we're if we're spending whatever
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
$10 million I'm pulling a number out of
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
the air for breakfasts
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
and half of it's going in the trash we
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
should know about that it becomes a real
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
number I'm not sure if we could measure
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
that I I just wasn't sure whether it
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
might be possible to know the number of
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
meals that aren't necess or number of
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
breakfasts that aren't actually
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
delivered they're they're made they're
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
heated they're stored they're waiting
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
for someone to pick them up and then
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
right they're they're thrown away
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
directly without going through the
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
students's hands I don't know I'm I'm
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
asking just for some level of usage I
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
think that might depend to at the local
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
level because I I'm just connecting it
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
to my my students experience and so we
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
have to sign up you know ahead of time
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we're not charged until they
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually partake in that breakfast so I
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
mean there's the sign up but they don't
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
actually incur the cost of the meal
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
until it's delivered so I'm not
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
sure how we would collect that but I can
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
I mean we could always talk to other
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
states and see if there's anything that
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
they do that we could look at to try to
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
measure that was M thank you I guess
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank both chairs um I appreciate and
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
understand why you need to make this
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
offer to all the schools you know in
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
terms of your estimates but at some
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
point you're going to find some schools
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
already have the equipment and some
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
schools are simply not going to
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
participate in the program for whatever
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
reason um when do you think or can you
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
get a more accurate fiscal note with
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
regards to who actually will need this
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
money in order to build out a kitchen
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
program thank you for the question um I
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
think that we can put out a a
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
questionnaire on on that um and then the
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would all the response is
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
back um you know who would participate
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't participate who would need
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
um the equipment who doesn't already
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
have a breakfast after the Bell program
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
follow up just you know adding wouldn't
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
that provide a more accurate fiscal note
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
than this is assuming everybody
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
participates and everybody needs
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
equipment um I'm just looking to try to
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
get a more accurate note for for that
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
particular part of the program
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can um that we
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
can put out and in request um I think
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of this is just to to
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that um we make the committee
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
aware of what it could POS possibly cost
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and we know that the numbers are High
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
um but we just want to make sure that
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
all of those that are entitled are are
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
in um able to get those funds if they're
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
available representive Edwards
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I want to change
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
subjects a little bit uh get getting
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
around the issue of the 29 schools uh on
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
page one lines 20 through
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
23 am am I correct to read that to to to
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
to to such that we we're changing from
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
which participates to shall participate
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
does that turn in is that effectively a
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
mandate to those 20 29 schools that for
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
whatever reason have chosen not to
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
participate that they shall be compelled
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank thank you thank you
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Heath thank you
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.870 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
currently most schools take the lunch
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
program and breakfast
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
program um I don't know breakfast after
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
the Bell what would that look like in
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
practice what would kids be doing what
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
would adults be
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
doing thank you for the question so
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
there are a number of ways that um the
 
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
the program could operate um and that
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
would be a local level decision on how
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
what works best for them um it could
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
range from students being able to come
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
down to the cafeteria after the bell and
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
and get their um what's called unitized
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
meal and bring it back to their
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
classroom um there could be grab Ando in
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
the hallway that would require some um
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration in the hallway because
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
that is outside of the the cafeteria um
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
so those are just two examples on how
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
that might possibly work um they could
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
get Innovative and have a cart that
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
might go out go around to the classrooms
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
um the other things to take into
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
consideration is you know you know
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're not disrupting the classroom
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
setting that's already going on um so
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
again that's a local level um decision
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
on how that would how that would work
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
custodial staff do you have do you have
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
the custodial staff to um you know
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
maintain that um as
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
well follow up so
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the $7 million that you're discussing
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
is the worst possible case scenario that
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
it could be but it could
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
be2 200,000
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
or a smaller amount because most schools
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
those 29 schools that currently do not
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
offer a program through the federal
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
system do they currently offer some kind
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
of a feeding program to their
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
students the C program is the um
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
component that is the seven the 7even
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
million okay um so that program is a is
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
a bit different than um the breakfast
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
after the Bell okay trying to find that
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the oh my
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
goodness but the breakfast after the
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
Bell program is the one
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
that we had put in the 3.7 for the
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
startup and then indeterminable right
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um but in terms of the 29
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
schools that that now would be required
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
to offer some kind of a breakfast or a
 
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
lunch program do you know if they're
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
currently offering a program there are
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
some that are and there are some some
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that not but that aren't excuse me um
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
but as stated in the bill they would be
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
required to if they were
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
10% um they wouldn't be required to if
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
they were 10% for your reduced or less
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
so if they have 10% of children who are
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
free reduced free or reduced or less
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
they are not required to that that is
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
what the bill States so followup so most
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
schools offer a breakfast program and a
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
lunch program for which there
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
significant reimbursement by the federal
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
government correct um and um during the
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
summer there um there's a different
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
element to this but in past years it
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
seems that we've always run a summer
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
feeding program through the school
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
districts I and maybe it's just because
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
that was many years ago and I'm not
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
understanding what happens now did did
 
00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:23.069 align:start position:0%
understanding what happens now did did
that

00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
stop no um that program is a completely
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
different program from the school year
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
program there are different requirements
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
um for that program in order to be
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
eligible to serve meals at no cost to
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
the student so that um is a completely
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
different program uh than than um
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
what's for the Department of Education
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
um what is in um our bill follow what
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
yeah do you still offer Comm food
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
commodities to school districts is that
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
something that's still is available that
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
is correct that's operated through um
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
services not our department and the
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
summer feeding program that's operated
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
through the department and that's for
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
like Title One programs during the
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
summer where they run a a a structured
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
program that's correct it could be a
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
structured program um there could be a
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
um what's called an open site so any fun
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
in the sun something like that um any
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
any child who is between the ages of
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
0 to 18 can come and get a a meal at no
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
charge so that's fully fully enforced
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct okay yes that's com
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
that's um different uh than than what's
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
being spoken about here and and if I I'm
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand the different
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
elements we I think we all are so the
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
the program that we're talking about
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
would be like a a card that a family
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
would get that would offer them that
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
they could use
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
T so um I believe that that what you're
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
referencing is
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
SBT which is the chart on the back of
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
the page that DHHS will and that's okay
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
will speak about um what I believe
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're asking for for breakfast after
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
the Bell um if I can can kind of
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
summarize and and gather what you're
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
saying is that um you know yes we do
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
have a good number of locations that are
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
currently offered refering a breakfast
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
program this money that is um listed
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
from the Department um would just be for
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
even those schools that are currently
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
operating a breakfast program if they
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to partake in a program breakfast
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
after the Bell um that would be that's
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
what this money is earmarked for would
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
be um those costs for the equipment for
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
that particular program I I know it it's
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
I know it's a
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
lot I'm just not understanding why more
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
equipment would be needed for breakfast
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
after the Bell so if they're operating
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
in the hallway and they don't have
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
equipment to operate in the hallway that
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
would be those sorts of additional
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
things and and the department does not
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
have the data on um what equipment is
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
currently in a kitchen that they might
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
be able to take and transport into a
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
hallway so that's the that's what the
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
need for um additional equipment could
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
be and you're absolutely correct it
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
could be $200,000 because that might be
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
all of the schools that want to
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
participate in that um but we need to
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that the if every school
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to participate that we account
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
for um for those dollars so just one
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
more question okay um so if I'm a
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
teacher and I noticed that I have
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
um two or three children come who come
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
in barely on time and and they come
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
struggling in and I notice that they're
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
looking like they're starving and um I
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
know that they need something would
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
would they be eligible for the breakfast
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
after the belt I could say to them why
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't you get down and see Mrs so and so
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
and chill she'll set you up and you'll
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
be all set you'll feel better after you
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
come back that's the exact intent of of
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
the program yeah thank you very much r s
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
wner I think you
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
were one more question about breakfast
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
after the belt so the reimbursement for
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
this equipment you're making it your
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note makes it available to any
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
school in the state but what about
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
section D here it says reimbursement for
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the bill described in
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
this paragraph shall be available to
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
school districts in which 40% or more of
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
the students are eligible for free and
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
reduced doesn't that in itself limit the
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
pool of schools so it wouldn't be 100%
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the schools it would be something
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
less and I don't know how many meet that
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
criteria that that is correct that was
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
in um the amendment so yes it it is the
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
40% excuse me it is the the 40% higher
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
for your reduced that would be eligible
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
for that um that amount of money and how
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
many schools in the state fall in that
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
category I will have to get that number
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
for you okay thank you so the section B
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
above is the part that
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
says the department of edge shall
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
reimburse school districts for the
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
initial cost for equipment necessary to
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
implement this alternative breakfast
 
00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
delivery down below reimbursements for
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
after the Bell program described shall
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
be available to school districts in
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
which 40% or more of the students so
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
maybe there just needs to be some
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
clarification in the legislature that it
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
would only be for those school districts
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
that are 40%
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
more free and reduced because the way
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
that it it's written right now and I
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
think the way that we did our fiscal
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
note was so that we could Implement B
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
but then D would be um the component for
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
the reduced price meals so that those
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
meals would be then covered partly by
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
program but maybe the clarification
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
legislation needs to to spell that out a
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more clearly so that we would
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
know it would only be available to those
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
schools 40% free and
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
more

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um talking
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
about the various uh thresholds in the
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
bill the 10% that triggers the Mandate
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the 40% that we were just talking
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
about would it be fair to say that your
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
current fiscal note estimates expenses
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
based on the current list of schools
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
that meets those thresholds but since
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
those thresholds may change in the
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
future and the statutory language
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same there could be schools
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
that may be mandated in the future that
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
are not today that may be eligible for
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
that that may not be eligible or the
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
other way around so isn't there more
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
long-term uncertainty around the course
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
based on those possible fluctuations
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
um correct there could be different
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
fluctuations or changes in the future um
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the free and re I'll just say two
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
things one part is the free and reduced
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
applications and so in order to
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs families
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
fill out the free and reduced
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
applications we then base their ability
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
to participate in the food and nutrition
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
programs on if they're eligible with
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
through that but then there's also the
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
component that looks at our poverty
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
levels in the State um according to the
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
latest US Census Bureau data poverty in
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
the state has gone down to about 20%
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
compared to the previous year and so it
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
could go down the cost could go down
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
they could go up they could go down but
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in that Trend it's
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
possible that it would go down thank you
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I use the word uncertainty
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
not one way or the
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
other I have a question uh in the prior
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
discussion you said that program is not
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
part of these programs how many other
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
programs are there just you don't need
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
to describe them just say there's two
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
or to that way thank you for the
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
question other programs this is a
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
yearound program um so the office of
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services at the
 
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services at the
department

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
operates six and a half let's say um
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
programs and um so they range from what
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
we're speaking about now which is
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
encumbering of the the breakfast and
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
lunch program um we also operate the
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
child um and adult care program for food
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
we operate seamless summer we operate um
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
summer food service program um fresh
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
program and a special milk program
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
that's the half um and the form table
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
program on the way and we do have um a
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
farm to table Grant as well um so that
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
is the um all of the the federal
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
programs that that we currently operate
 
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
in the um in the nutrition office then
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
if this if this bill doesn't see the
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
light of day all those programs that are
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
going on are
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
unaffected what this is really doing is
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
adding a layer in the summertime is my
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that I'm going give
 
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.349 align:start position:0%
understanding is that I'm going give
getting

00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
warmer I think
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of components put
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
into this piece of legislation there's a
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
lot of different aspects and so I think
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
it can be a bit
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
confusing yes because there's so many
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
different pieces that are put in so not
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
to to draw attention to away from what
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
we were talking about but if you go into
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
the second page when we're looking at
 
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.109 align:start position:0%
the second page when we're looking at
the

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
um lines 21 through 26 that's focusing
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
on you know this very small piece here
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
the department shall adopt rules
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
requiring schools to offer online and
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
physical free or reduced price School
 
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.750 align:start position:0%
physical free or reduced price School
meals

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
application the it's a very simple
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
sentence but this is implementation this
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
program has a wider
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
implication for the local level and at
 
00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
the state level because currently you
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
know there are a few schools that have
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
an online application and then they're
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
required also to provide a physical
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
paper but we also have many schools and
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
many leas that are not offering a
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
digital form to fill out so for them to
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
have to implement and be required to
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
provide that online form is something
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
that we have put the cost at being
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
indeterminable because because it
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
requires them to purchase a system and
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
offer that application they can't just
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
you know throw any application or any
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
income verification form in there it has
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
to be specific some schools can already
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
afford to do that some cannot so I just
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about that that there
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
are a lot of pieces within this
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that we just want to be
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
clear like I know it was difficult for
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
Mr ruple to kind of go through this
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
earlier and just kind of say well
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's this piece of it that costs this
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
much this piece is indeterminable that
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
online applications piece indeterminable
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
one sentence but it could have some
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
implications at the local level that we
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
just have to be upfront about and we're
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
not saying it's good or bad we're just
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
saying this is these are the facts it's
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to cost at the local level and we
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how much because it's
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
just going to be dependent on that
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
school and what they what they have to
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
implement that works with their system
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
let's dive into the weeds for a second
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm a school that says
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
leg legislation passes and it now says
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
you shall do this and I say I'm not
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
happened well that's a great question
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
but with $1 allocated probably not a
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
whole lot because there's no funds to
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
actually implement the program but I
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
mean it I think we do have to be careful
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
about what we're requiring I agree yes
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I UND I want
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
to go back a little bit um to the
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the bell I I understand
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
the benefits of breakfast after the bell
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
and how it meets um students where
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
they're at which is sometimes coming in
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
at the last minute um after the seated
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
program um I know the school I'm
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with has a you know you can
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
enter the building at 8:45 and at 9:00
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
the second bell rings and you should be
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
in your classroom so they literally have
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
this tiny went out to eat the benefit of
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell is they're not
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
as rushed and they can meet more
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
children but can you just clarify you
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
did use the word if if a school that
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
participates in school breakfast program
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
takes part in breakfast after the Bell
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
so this legislation will not mandate
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
their participation to change over to
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the bell and require new
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
equipment is that correct thank you for
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
the question as the
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
legislative as the bill reads that is
 
00:54:56.079 --> 00:54:56.910 align:start position:0%
legislative as the bill reads that is
correct

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
it is not requiring them it is um
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
requiring the state to pay for that
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
startup equip startup equipment but if
 
00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
they choose to operate breakfast after
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
the belt then they would be entitled to
 
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
that equipment if it was um if they are
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
40% or higher okay I just was cl wanted
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
to clarify that this is not mandating
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
that every school that offers breakfast
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
is going to require new equipment to
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
participate in a new program if they
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
already offer breakfast wh they're fine
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
as is if they want that's correct great
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank thank you I I I I think I
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
have a different set of questions but in
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
response to representative toki's
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
question I I I've now become confused by
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
the clarification because because
 
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
earlier we said that on page one lines
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
20 through
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
23 in fact change uh an a a law that
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
enables participation it changes it to a
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
shall participate and so therefore some
 
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
schools that have not chosen to
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
participate are going to be compelled if
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
this becomes law to participate in a way
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
they've chosen not to
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
yet two different programs be breakfast
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
after the bill separate going into
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
section two where there's line number 20
 
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's requiring so that they shall
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
partic ipate in the National School
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
breakfast program un um unless they have
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
10% of
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
enrolled sorry unless the school
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
district implements its own breakfast
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
program or less than 10% of enrolled
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
pupils are eligible for free for reduced
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
price okay I think it's the sh they have
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
to I think I understand that so so so
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
now can I do my real questions um okay
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
so um it I'm I'm going to say what I
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
think I've heard in various DBS and
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
drabs as we've gone through and I'm
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
going to consolidate it and I want you
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
to tell me if I'm accurate or not and if
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not please please correct me of this
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill the only component of this bill
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
that builds on an existing program is
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
the reduced lunch Pro program the the
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch component of the
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
program that this is an area that the
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can handle an
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
expansion of the program so that reduced
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
lunches become free to those that are
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
eligible uh and you don't need the
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
to to support that component of the
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
overall bill is is that is that correct
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
if a a bill that just had that component
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
for that we're going to pay for the
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
lunch of our red news price students and
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
the state will cover that it costs
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
500,000 we estimate we could Implement
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
that starting school uh this school year
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm sorry fall of 2024 so we
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
could implement it hit the ground
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
running and complete it and have it
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
ready to go so so the policy decision
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
there is does the state want to take
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch prices and convert them so
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
that they become free to eligible
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
students is that is that really what the
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
policy issue is is that we're we're
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
confronting right now as long as we have
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
the funds to do so the 500,000 alloc no
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
I understand the funds but the policy is
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
that did I get the yes I mean we we we
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
know who those students are we know that
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
there's a need there there's no question
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
we could Implement that so so so final
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay so uh so so that's a very
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
specific policy question does the state
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
want to take reduced price lunches and
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
make them free for those ible children
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
and currently we do that for breakfast
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's a pause not a completion
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay so so that's the policy issue isn't
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
it normal that the that the the house
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
Committee of Education would make that
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a policy determination before it
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
comes to finance it sort of sort of
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
feels to me that we're being propelled
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
into making a policy decision here when
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's really money attached to it is
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
the only reason this policy questions
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
coming to us wouldn't this normally
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you normally be talking to uh
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee um yes or
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
no there are a number of bills that have
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
a dollar of General funds given or
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
appropriated for it that cannot be we
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
cannot do it without having appropriate
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
funding for it so I would say
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm not writing these policies I've
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
given my feedback on you know all the
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
components of this piece of legislation
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
it's I've provided that and then I'm
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
here to provide the information to to
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
this committee and I'll provide it to
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
whoever else um wants uh the information
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
will will'll always be there to provide
 
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.069 align:start position:0%
will will'll always be there to provide
that

01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
backup an observation Mr chair that that
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we we're we've
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
skipped over the policy committee and
 
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
we've gone straight to the money and we
 
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what the policy committee
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
would want to do on on expanding this
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
program in this way to make free lunches
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
instead of reduced price lunges I don't
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think we know don't we don't
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
know okay and so then the rest of this
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill seems to have a lot of
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
implementation complications it's not
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been obvious to us in the
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
last hour so it just seems like it may
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
we may want to schedule an additional
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
work session that I hadn't anticipated
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
because this is more complex than I
 
01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
thought it would be represent tki I just
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
want to clarify we have yet to hear from
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS which is a whole other part of this
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill that I'd like to dig into and I
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
believe we're running out of time
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
so I mean we haven't even touched on
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
that other part of the bill would that
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
be the U the summer summer EBT and the
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
bill okay I thought adequacy was fun to
 
01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
bill okay I thought adequacy was fun to
play

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
play
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
with Mr chair oh I'm sorry no worry
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate Mr chair thank
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
you um I just wanted
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand that what when
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the reduced price
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
launch becoming uh free we are moving
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
from a graduated system where people who
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
are at a certain level get free and then
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
people get reduced and then people pay
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
for it we are moving to basically a zero
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
to full price system would that be
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
correct if that part of the bill is
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
implemented paid for by have different
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
funding source and So currently of
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
course of course we are paying with
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
State money because the feds only pay
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
for part but I'm talking from the point
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
of view of the people receiving the
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
benefit they would now have two Cho two
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
categories of them either people who get
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
free lunch or people who pay full price
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
whatever we charge at school level there
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the intermediate reduced we
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
would still have that category just like
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
we do for breakfast right now the state
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
currently pays for the reduced price
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
students to have so we still need to
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
identify those students we still need to
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
um for all of our other purposes yes um
 
01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:39.799 align:start position:0%
but yes students that previously would
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
just have paid a reduced amount which I
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
think is a 40 cents up to 40 cents we
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
would be covering that cost so from from
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
that point of view my question is
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
obviously from our side we got to keep
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
doing the same work but the perception
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
the you know reception from the
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
people who received the benefit side
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
would be that now there would be you
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
know zero or full price launch with
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
nothing in between correct and I also if
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
I could mention too that we have a
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
number of families that fluctuate back
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
and forth so one year they're free the
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
next year they're reduce and they go
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
back and and so I would say that this
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
would greatly benefit those families
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
that you know they're on that that that
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
cusp and we can provide that
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'll turn the gavl back
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
over now for HHS portion all right uh
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
um so DHHS how do you all want to
 
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:48.870 align:start position:0%
um so DHHS how do you all want to
represent

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
present so so miss Fox are you are you
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
hiding from us or are you just going to
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
strategic second strike if Miss Ebert
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
says something
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
wrong oh okay all right so so miss Ebert
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
let me let me first just try to make
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
this simple for for for my head here uh
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
is is it the case that in this bill the
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
relevant portion of this bill from the
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective the Department
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
perspective starts at page three on line
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
six and basically Al runs through the
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
Appropriations section um which may go
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
all the way down to page four uh line
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
19 is is is that that that's really
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
about the Department of Health and Human
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
Services is it not yes and just for the
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
record Karen heer director of the
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
division of economic stability for DHHS
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
so yes and and all of the discussion we
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
just had on the doe components of this
 
01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.029 align:start position:0%
just had on the doe components of this
bill

01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
does not imply any action by the
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is almost as though it's a wholly
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
separable bill at that point is is is
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah the sections for the
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
are not dependent on the doe portions of
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
this bill so it's separate okay so with
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
that clarification in mind just tell us
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
what you want to tell
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
us uh I'm here to certainly answer any
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
particular questions that you have um
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
you know with respect to the fiscal note
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
or the the language that's in the bill
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
um I will clarify that the language
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill um while the
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
department certainly supports the
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
concept of a summer EBT program for
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
those families who would qual those
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
children rather who would qualify for
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
that particular benefit it's designed to
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
complement the school um uh school year
 
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
complement the school um uh school year
programs

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh for uh meal programs that are offered
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
through the schools uh so this is a
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
benefit specifically to um continue um
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
supporting those particular children who
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
are eligible for the meals benefits
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
during the school year to be eligible
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
for benefit during the summer
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
months uh so what's what's important to
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
note however is that the summer EBT
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
program is still subject to the Federal
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
government's approval of our state plan
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh specifically the US Department of
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and the food and nutrition
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
services we have submitted a plan a
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
draft plan to uh the federal government
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
for summer EBT specifically to would be
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
initiated for the summer of
 
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.470 align:start position:0%
initiated for the summer of
24

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
benefit uh however we have included in
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
that particular plan certain conditions
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
that need to be in place in order for us
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
to implement M this program that
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
includes funding that is part of the uh
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
part of this particular
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill so at this point what I think I
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
just heard you say is that for the
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
summer of 24 if we were to pass this
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill the department
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to execute uh
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
because we are allowed to rely on our
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
own systems our own methods but that by
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
the time summer of 25 comes along we we
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
may have some new compliance
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that are not completely
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
clear to us we've submitted a a plan we
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
have not received feedback yet from um
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture of the
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
federal department that they've approved
 
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.630 align:start position:0%
federal department that they've approved
our

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
plan partially correct we have submitted
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
a plan specifically for the summer of 24
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
benefit we have not submitted a plan for
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
25 it is not due until
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
August uh so we'll be working on that
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note for fiscal year 25
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
includes the cost for standing up the
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
program starting in the summer of
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
24 but because there is a
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that for a summer of 25
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
benefit has to be dispersed 7 to 14 days
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
before the summer period so we basically
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
have to dis
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
the summer of 25 benefit in June of
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
25 still during the fiscal year of 25 so
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with this
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
particular fiscal note include costs
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
that would support standing up the
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
program and distributing a benefit for
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
summer of 24 but also Distributing a
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
benefit for the summer of
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
25 summer of 25 benefit is what the
 
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
state will be required to meet a number
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
of requirements from the federal
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
government to be able to implement that
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
program they're allowing a number of
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
flexibilities to States for a summer of
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
24 benefit because they know states are
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
having a bit of a tough time and trying
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the requirements set out
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
in the inm final rule for this
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
particular program so they're allowing
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
some flexibilities so that we can still
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
do a dispersement for children in the
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
representative wer and then
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative walner thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
where is it envisioned that this feeding
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
will take place in the
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
summertime for the summer of 24
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
benefit yes so it will take us uh
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
probably until uh October or November to
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
disperse the first iteration of a
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
benefit for the summer of 24 what we
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
depend upon is a data file from the New
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education department that
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
includes a list of all of the children
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
who are uh eligible and certified for
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
the national school lunch
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
program those are the folks who are are
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
eligible for the summer EBT program and
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
we don't get that file until October or
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
November so so I think the question was
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
more related to whether or not there's a
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
a central feeding location or Central
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
feeding location
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
and and I think this program is set up
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
to take existing EBT cards and make them
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
charge them so that they can be used by
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
the families during the summer but since
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
we can't disperse the money until
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
October it they are not really going to
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
get a summer 24 benefit they're going to
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
get a Halloween uh
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
treat correct and I apologize I
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question well you
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
have followups well it seems like so if
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's an EBT wherever they buy the food
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever else they want to buy with
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
the EBT card not not necessarily food so
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
there's no uh eating at the school in
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
the summer time because it could be
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
closed for construction or cleaning
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
correct it's not the the physical uh Act
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
of eating it's receiving the benefit on
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
an EBT card electronic benefit transfer
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
card so that they can use that money uh
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
and for many folks um uh they would be
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
using the benefit in addition to SNAP
 
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
benefits that they may already have on
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
an EBT card so that they would buy uh
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
groceries using the EBT card during the
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
summer but I just to clarify if if I'm
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
if this passes and I'm going to the
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
local school during the summer to get my
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
lunch breakfast whatever I'm going to
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
get and then in October I'm going to get
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
an EBT card for the summer of 24 I get
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
double I'm double
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
dipping I I can't speak for the school
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
programs that they may offer during the
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
summer this is specifically a um uh a
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
separate program I I understand that
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking it's a separate
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
program but it could be the same
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
student yes okay thank you did you have
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
a question over here that's okay I was
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
go are there other questions from Miss
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hebert do do you have did this trigger
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
you want to want to add more what you've
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
already told us uh I will take any other
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
questions that there may be so
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative Heath and then oh I
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
skipped you representative walner uh
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
let's do representative walner first and
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
then representative he okay you got
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
you so I'm looking at the fiscal
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
node and um I see that
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest impact in the fiscal node is
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
the systems cost and I think when you
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
were here before at the public hearing I
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
think I I asked you about the systems
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
cost I mean that is a
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
onetime cost that this that will last
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
this program into the future that's
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
correct so we put that so even though
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's a big hit at the beginning it lasts
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
a long time correct okay and can you
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
remind me how much um each child will
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
receive on their EBT card
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
for the summer period it is a total of
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
$120 $120 for for the full for the full
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
month thank
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Heath thank you um my
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
just a quick question what is the source
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
of your data what where do you draw your
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
data to obtain the um free and reduced
 
01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
data to obtain the um free and reduced
lunch

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
count so uh initially we well two
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
sources we have based the number on uh
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
what's projected by the US Department of
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
Agriculture they did a projection for
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
each state but then we also took uh
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
combined that with information we had
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
from pandemic EBT so we had summer
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic EBT for the last three Summers
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
So based on the number of children who
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
or families who applied for that and who
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
were eligible under the school meals
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
program were able to refine that number
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
a bit more uh so that that's where that
 
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.910 align:start position:0%
a bit more uh so that that's where that
comes

01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
comes
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
from um does that include medic
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
we have asked the uh yes it we we have
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
asked uh that as part of our plan
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
proposed plan to include those children
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
who are Medicaid eligible thank you very
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
much represent
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you and I think perhaps you
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
can help me clarify I've sort of walked
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
myself in a loop here when I was first
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
reading it and you talked about summer
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
2024 I thought it meant summer 2024 but
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
then you were talking about the money
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
not showing up until October my first
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they would receive
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
the money in 2024 and y'all would get
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursed but they're not it's actually
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the EBT card the individual who
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
won't see that boost until later in the
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
year as opposed to receiving it in the
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
summer and you receiving the
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement later correct the state
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't front the funding it is a direct
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
benefit from the federal government so
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
what's happening is that because we are
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
having like all states having some
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
challenges in implementing a summer 24
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
program we can't put something in place
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
that actually delivers the benefit
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
during the summer months of 24 it's not
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
physically possible so the best that we
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
can do is get out a majority of that
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
benefit by October or November after we
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
have worked with the Department of
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
Education thank you for you're welcome
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
so just I got to stay clear on this so
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
so what I think I just heard the Nuance
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
is that the EBT cards once they're
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
active and capable
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
get uh loaded directly from the federal
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
government but it isn't until after
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
October or so for the Department to have
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
enabled those EBT cards somehow in order
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
for the money to hit the card and so
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
therefore the the kids the families
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
still won't get the $40 a month until
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
October at the at the best correct
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be actually two iterations just
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly clear yeah so for those
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh children who are we we know will be
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
eligible for the national school lunch
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
program we will receive that information
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire education
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
department here's a list of all the
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
children currently eligible we can issue
 
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
a benefit of those uh those families as
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
soon as we have that
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
information it may take 30 days you you
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
need to go back to months because I now
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
you've got me on Summer in October are
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
you adding another date in here for the
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
summer of 24 benefit that's the only
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
benefit I'm talking
 
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
about we will get uh the inform we will
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
get a list of the children who are
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
eligible from the Department of
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
Education we will get that list roughly
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
October it may take 30 days for us to
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
get the benefit out the door to those
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
folks but we also plan to open up an
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
application period for amilies who may
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
not be on that list but would still be
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
eligible uh so say they uh just moved
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
here from another state or they uh
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
didn't apply sooner for the school lunch
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
program but they've recently applied so
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't make the list so we have an
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
application period that we're going to
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
enable families to apply for the benefit
 
01:17:50.639 --> 01:17:52.750 align:start position:0%
enable families to apply for the benefit
as

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
well that will take probably another
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
month to be able to
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
then keep that window open for f for
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
families to apply for the benefit and
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
distribute so I'm still trying to put
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
things on my mental calendar the the
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
application period to get the kids that
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
are aren't on the list opens what in
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
October you still have to do do some
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
system work and it'll be October or
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
November before they can begin the
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
application process yeah the application
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
process would probably open up sometime
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
in November okay represent
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
tki thank you um so we've dug in a
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
little bit to the summer EBT program can
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
we turn to the elderly simplified
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
application and what the department
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
would what requirements you would have
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
to implement that maybe you can first
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
explain what it is and then if there are
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
costs associated sure essentially the uh
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question essentially
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
the elderly simplified application
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
program is is an option for states to do
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
exactly that
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
simplify the application specifically
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
for uh the population of uh individuals
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
elderly or disabled individuals who
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
would qualify for that benefit uh
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not earning there's no
 
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
earned income so we have about 7,000
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who would qualify for this
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
but it basically would uh uh one of the
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
the greatest benefits to that program is
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
that it would uh allow for a longer
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
duration of uh the benefits so that they
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to apply every year uh the
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
duration could be as long as three years
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
so it would save individuals from having
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
to come up with verification
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
documentation and having to do that
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
every single year uh there may be
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
challenges for people to be able to get
 
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
that information so it's meant to
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
simplify the process for them it would
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
also simplify the process for staff and
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the workload on them um the only
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
expense to this is a one-time system
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
cost which is included in that number
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
$75,000 sorry uh uh half of that uh for
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
um General funds to be able to implement
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
the system changes needed for that are
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
you staying around
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
$37,000 yes no um no
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
75,000 is the total
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
cost for system changes for the elderly
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
simplified application period so it's
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay because I'm I'm looking at the
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
table the table says systems costs is
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
752 th000 that includes summer EBT and
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
that and that and that number is the
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
aggregate of the sumary EBT and the
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
elderly simplified application correct
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that if we only did the
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
elderly streamlining that would be 10%
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
of that number or about
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
no the the federal government would
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse as 50 it's 50%
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
of of so the systems cost for that piece
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
would be about
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
$37,000 of State money if that's all we
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
did it would make it easier for our
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
elderly to instead of reapplying every
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
year they would apply once and it would
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
be good for three years correct is that
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fair summary yes okay now
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's a reason they we've had them
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
reapplying every year is that is that
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
because we're concerned about fraud if
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
somebody dies or what why why what was
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
the initial rationale on a
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
year uh that's the that's the program
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
that is the way it has been uh as long
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
as I am aware do we need to worry about
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
fraud if somebody dies and somebody use
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
to draw the benefit I don't think so I
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
mean I think that we're always Mindful
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't change um the the
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
duration of the period so I I mean we
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
receive information automatically uh
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to individuals who have
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
passed so I'm not not sure that that
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be a conern so there's no
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
additional fraud risk by extending the
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
time frame no okay are there other
 
01:22:21.239 --> 01:22:24.910 align:start position:0%
time frame no okay are there other
questions

01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh we we are we're scheduled to end
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
at 2:30 so we're pretty much there I
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
think we've broken down this bill into
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
many of its component parts and uh and I
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
I I'd almost suggest um U representative
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
emmerich that division 3 really focus on
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
um that that uh that third page starting
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
on line six to for the rest of the
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
relevant stuff and then division two can
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
arm wrestle the all the other programs
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
and and talk to the education committee
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
to determine if they have a policy
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
perspect I I I don't know how we get
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
there from here this is a lot of policy
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
I know read how what what what what's
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
your idea on how how we divide this and
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
we get it to the finance committee that
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
makes the most
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
sense I'll take the education piece and
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
you take the uh HHS piece okay I happen
 
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
to have this on the calendar for the
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
209th uh which is the the next work
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
session for for this bill for for and I
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
think I think that was meant to be a
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
joint so so you would have to figure out
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
what your next meeting would be that
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
29th I I don't know what's in the
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
calendar you may not even have to
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
recalendar it I don't know we could just
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
sir okay so on the 29th I think I booked
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
us for 1:00 for another joint or that
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
positive yeah so that that's that's when
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
we were going to do some more joint work
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
you you could maybe we could meet in
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
separate rooms at the same time I don't
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
know if that addresses the calendar I
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
didn't hear what representative wer said
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
did you said you have had something he
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
morning so division two could meet at 10
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock in
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
209 okay that's our
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
plan well now we changed because
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
formalar okay so um so I think we have a
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
general plan um you got a calendaring
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
thing for next week uh we're going to
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
keep the calendar for division three to
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
focus on our share of the bill at 1:00
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
29th um and then I guess we'll huddle to
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
see what kind of we overall proposal we
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
have on 499 to the full
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee okay okay um is there anyone
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the audience that has wanted to speak
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
that hasn't had an opportunity to
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
speak no you're not being compelled to
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
speak but you are being invited should
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Laura milikin from
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunger Solutions um just a
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
couple of things I mean I think I think
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's come across that the pieces that
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
are funded in the bill are are the uh on
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
the doe side the reduced priced meal
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
pick the state would pick up the cost
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the reduced price kids to eat free
 
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.070 align:start position:0%
for the reduced price kids to eat free
meal

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
meal
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
and on the DHHS side uh it would fund
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
the startup costs for sumary EBT which
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
is a new federal program so new federal
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
dollars would be coming into the state
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
and it would be the systems costs that
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
are required um to access those federal
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
dollars um and then uh I think that um
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh Karen uh explained the the elderly
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
simplified application project the other
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
pieces in the bill the $1 pieces were
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
intended if there were federal dollars
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
or available as I understand it um of
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
course I did not amend the bill but um
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
but that that was my understanding um
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
and uh from talking to the sponsors that
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
that that was the the intention um that
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
only if federal dollars additional
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
federal dollars were available not not
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that the doe currently
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
has um but if for example for breakfast
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
after the Bell if there were additional
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
arpa dollars one thing I'll say about
 
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell which again is
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
not actually funded in this bill but it
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
is a program that's intended to uh
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
reduce stigma and increase participation
 
01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
and breakfast right now only about 48%
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the kids who participate in free and
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
reduced meals partic uh sorry who
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
participate in free and reduced lunch
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
participate in breakfast and that's
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
because schools generally offer
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
Breakfast early in the morning so
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are time issues that
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
kids can't get there but often it's
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
because the only kids who eat breakfast
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
before the Bell early in the morning are
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
the poor kids and as soon as kids
 
01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
realize that that's true they'd rather
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
go hungry than participate in breakfast
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
but there but breakfast after the Bell
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
is an evidencebased approach you make
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
breakfast a part of the school day
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
Everybody Eats breakfast nobody knew
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
knows who's paying and who's not just
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
like lunch so that's uh and so the
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
intention in the bill was to create
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
incentives for schools to do the
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
breakfast provision
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
differently um not schools don't have to
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
do it but if they want to do it there
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
available so I think you brought Tom
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
celic with you today
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh well welcome back to the house house
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh The Honorable bro uh Brody uh Des Des
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um do you have
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
anything I have nothing to add now but
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm here to Avail myself of any
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions um if it's needed but thank
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
you all right are there any questions
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Who's the who
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
Who's the champion on the community
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
eligibility provision the C program
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
who who do I look at on that one I I
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
can't figure out who to who to talk so
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I I uh so the community
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility provision is a provision
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's available for schools with high
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
poverty kids high percentages of kids
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
who are living in poverty to offer
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
Universal meals at the school level for
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
for all kids for free and
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the federal government reimburses at
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
a higher rate um based on that those
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
poverty percentages but right now of the
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
90 schools in New Hampshire who could
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
participate in the community eligibility
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
provision only about two are um and
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
that's because it is um until you
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
implement the program it's hard to
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
realize the economies of scale it's it's
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
hard to know uh how much the exposure is
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
so the idea is for the state to help
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
incentivize schools to be able to use
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars to feed the most
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
kids in in in a way that produces the
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
least stigma so the that program does
 
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
not apply to the elderly or the dis
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
disabled does not does not it does not
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
that's a program for schools um and
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
again the amendment changed the
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of schools uh that that could
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
be funded
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
but there's $1 to fund that program it
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
is not a funded it is not funded in this
 
01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
is not a funded it is not funded in this
bill

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here just a
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
clarification question you said that
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
breakfast participation is lower because
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
lower income kids are the only ones
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
eating breakfast later when breakfast
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
you know later breakfast is not offered
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
could you help me understand why because
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
I genuinely you know I'm not sure why
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
that happens and I'm sure you do
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
know yeah yeah I mean my understanding
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
um if breakfast is only offered in the
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
cafeteria um and only before the
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
Bell um and buses don't usually get kids
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
there that early unless they're the the
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
identified as the free kids then they're
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
identified as the free kids I know of a
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
school that has um free and reduced they
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
call it uh
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
early free and reduced breakfast I mean
 
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have to be
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you don't have to be very old to
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
understand um
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
that if it's called free and reduced
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
breakfast then everybody know and you go
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
everybody knows you're a free and
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
reduced kid I'll I'll also add um
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative that when it comes to
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
busing schedules there can be a very
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
tight window for students to be able to
 
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
participate in breakfast I mean if your
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
bus for example like I can think of our
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
local school district buses get there
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
between for high school about 7:00 to
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
7:10 and classes start promptly at 7:25
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
so to expect a student to go to their
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
locker drop off some of their stuff or
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
even take their stuff with them through
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
the lunch line to get their food I mean
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
at a certain point often times students
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
are ending up eating in the classroom
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
and that's because teachers are either
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
permitting it or teachers who really
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
don't like that happening in their
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
classroom it becomes more um you know it
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
becomes difficult for a student to be
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
able to eat eat all their food uh that
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
they've been able to acquire so than a
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
flag just a clarification
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
question obviously a school calling it
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
that way is a something that that school
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
really needs to change I you know I
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
thought they were supposed to not uh in
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
any way distinguish between how kids are
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
treated right based on their ability to
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
pay and all that so that would be a
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
clear corrective action that the school
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
should take so we leave that out of the
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
discussion of these bills but if that
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
breakfast program is open to
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
anyone are we saying that because free
 
01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
and kids eligible for free and reduce
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
are more likely to make the effort to be
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
there that's what identifies them as I
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
said I'm genuinely trying to understand
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
because it would seem to me that if the
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
breakfast program is open to everyone
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
well whoever shows up for breakfast
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
shows up for breakfast how would you
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
know whether I you know I just like
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
eating the school breakfast or I need to
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
eat it because I qualify for free and
 
01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.470 align:start position:0%
eat it because I qualify for free and
reduce

01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
again I'm trying to understand where the
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
stigma comes from because obviously
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
addressed I just need to understand why
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is the best way to address that
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
stigma rather than other potential
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative it's past 2:30 and I'd
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
like to wind this down understood I'm
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
good I think we're getting into uh sort
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
of an American cultural issue that the
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
kids that went to Junior High probably
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
understand and we can talk about it
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
offline um but the stigma is real I'm
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
sure um the the the what I picked up in
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is that there is um uh an
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
implication a secondary effect that a
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of bus schedules are going to get
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
changed if we pass the this
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill no no may I may I clarify something
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that is the implication
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
at all good good that's why I'm asking
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
the question the problem is like we were
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussing the window and I mentioned
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
earlier the window of time that the
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
children can enter the building and then
 
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
have to be SE sitting at their desk for
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
the start of the day the school I'm
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with that I worked at is a
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
15minute window however that doesn't
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
mean those children get off the bus at
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning of that 15minute window
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
they may get off the bus five minutes
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
before they need to be sitting at their
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
desk they have to throw their coat off
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
race up to the cafeteria grab their food
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
and they're now eating in a very
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
unhealthy way so the breakfast after the
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
Bell allows more
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
participation and a better program for
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
the child not to feel rushed and have to
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
Wolf down the food if if if I may Mr
 
01:35:31.229 --> 01:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
chairman the goal is to make it so the
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
school date doesn't have to be extended
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
because that's a cost of the property
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers by integrating it into the day
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you both everything that she
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned would appreciate it are there
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions because I'd like to
 
01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.629 align:start position:0%
any other questions because I'd like to
close

01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
this okay not seeing any questions we
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
are going to close the work session on
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%

minutes so that people can take a bio
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
break and we can reorganize who's in the
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

director of the division for Behavioral
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
Health and I'm here on S SP 406 in
 
01:45:15.870 --> 01:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and the funding for
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
our shelter programs in the state I do
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
want to um provide a little bit of
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
information that came up this morning
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um as I said then and
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate there are
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
950 beds that are funded by the state
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and the funding is
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
flows through 13
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
organizations and they are um located in
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
all regions of the state we as a result
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
of the hb2 funding that we received we
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
had um the funding available for two
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
years um of the additional $4 million
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
what we decided to do was that we were
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
poised to procure for shelter Services
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
as you know we want to go out and um uh
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
out to bid um frequently enough so that
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
we can um make sure we're getting the
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
best price and also having the
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see how the shelters are
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
doing we were not in a position to be
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
able to do that in time for a July 1st
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
start so we took the funding that was
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
available effective July 1st um and we
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
distributed it among those existing
 
01:46:42.669 --> 01:46:42.679 align:start position:0%
shelters that we were in contract with
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
we then went out to bid and um on March
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
27th we received governor and councel
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
approval for the new contracts
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
and what I wanted to distribute to you
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
is the easiest way to tell you where
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
those shelters who the shelters are and
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
where they're situated is to provide to
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
you a copy of the governor and Council
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
letter which has the name of the
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
contractors who the where which area of
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
the state they serve and how much
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
funding they received for that um period
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
which is April 1st 2024 through June
 
01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.350 align:start position:0%
which is April 1st 2024 through June
30th

01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
30th
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
2025 I thought that would be the best
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
way instead of recreating a um table um
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you would be able to see how those
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh funds are distributed and which
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
programs are serving which areas of the
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
state that that that sounds good Mr
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
Ripple would would you would you hand
 
01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:50.669 align:start position:0%
Ripple would would you would you hand
those

01:47:50.669 --> 01:47:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
out while that's being done can I ask a
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
question so uh most of the discussion we
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
had was about increasing the
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
$20 uh day rate that we pay to the
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
existing shelters to a $27 rate for
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
existing shelters are we saying that
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
this two and a half million is going to
 
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
all go to new contracts and none of it's
 
01:48:13.589 --> 01:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
going to go to the existing contracts
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
after that discussion oh that that's a
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
great question thank you it is our
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
intent because of um the way that the
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill is written is that we would
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
distribute it to the contractors who
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
just entered into contract with us so
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
the ones that will you'll see um in this
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
table are the ones that would receive
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
the additional funding and we would do
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
it based on the same formula that we use
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
to allocate the funds that were provided
 
01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:47.350 align:start position:0%
to allocate the funds that were provided
in

01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
followup well I see I see 13 contracts
 
01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.109 align:start position:0%
followup well I see I see 13 contracts
on

01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
here and
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
um uh which ones are the new ones that
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
are going into effect in April these all
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
went into effect April 1st um and all of
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
them so this was a brand new procurement
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
brand new contracts um you can see in
 
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
the in the letter that it's um the
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
option to renew for five years these are
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that um should this uh Senate
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
bill pass um that we would um distribute
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
the funds
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
to so um weren't these facilities
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
providing similar Services before this
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
contract and was State partially funding
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
them at the at the $8 a day rate so I
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
believe that um as a result of the
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
procurement there were a couple of
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
changes so there were some um programs
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
that decided not to apply and there were
 
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
new ones that were funded but
 
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
essentially these are the core shelter
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.709 align:start position:0%
 
state

01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
question I just have a quick question we
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
heard briefly this morning about the
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
need for um specific Youth
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
Services um for homeless and I know very
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
recently in Nashville we had a couple of
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the state funed programs
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
but we lost um some local service
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
for youth homeless and it also made me
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
think of the increased need for services
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
for lgbtq youth or adults um do you have
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
any information on um specifically to
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
those two communities if they would be
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
able to benefit from this so um these
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
programs do not address that population
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
we do have um recently um wayo um in
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester has has a young adult shelter
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
and they receive funding through gopher
 
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
um and um that is a program that was
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
stood up I believe during the pandemic
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
and they um they built that shelter they
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
renovated that shelter and so we have
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
that and then there are other programs
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
that are funded uh for children's
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
residential treatment services through
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
our children's Behavioral Health um in
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
in the mental health budget and the
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
division budget so those are separate
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm I'm looking at the bill that
 
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
was submitted to us uh and it looks like
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's had some amendments um how is it
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
you read it so that only these 13 would
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a share of the 2.5
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um that is a great question
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
that is how we would operationalize the
 
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill as it currently stands um as you
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
can imagine to repure or to have this
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
funding go to different programs and go
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
through that whole process wouldn't
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
achieve the goal of providing that
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
immediate funding um that the shelters
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
themselves indicated that they
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
need okay so what I think I heard heard
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
you just say is that you all are making
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
um a a prioritize you're prioritizing it
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
so that you can get the money out
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
quicker and more efficiently and because
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
these contracts only went into effect
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
one April the implication is that it's
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
easier to amend those contracts than the
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
ones that have been in place
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
longer so yes I I think you said it more
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
eloquently than I did but yes it would
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
be the most efficient and effective way
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
to distribute the funds and these
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
programs were just selected through a
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
competitive bid process and so um to
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
take the two and a half and do a whole
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
new reprocurement or procurement just
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
for those funds would be um lengthy okay
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
so the the reason that we don't want to
 
01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
go back further than one April is now
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
again I'm just trying to understand the
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
situation is is that uh those were
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
awarded on
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
non-competitive basis uh Soul Source
 
01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of things these were competitively
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
awarded so even though the work may be
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
similar in terms of every contract is
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to need an amendment to change the
 
01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
rate right yes whether the contract was
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
signed one April or July 1 the the the
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to the contract would
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
essentially be the same and a sheet of
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
paper that says this amends the rate to
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
this new rate right so um there are no
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
contracts that um were prior to they all
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
expired on March 30th and so as of April
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
1st these are the shelter contracts that
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
are um state funded throughout the state
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
that's good data and like I said the um
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
the programs are essentially the same
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
there are just a couple changes again a
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
couple of programs that chose not to um
 
01:54:19.069 --> 01:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
submit a bid and a couple of programs
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
that were funded that were
 
01:54:25.229 --> 01:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
new thank you so um so that makes sense
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
why those would be the ones you'd go
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
amend because you actually have active
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
contracts that are amendable so that
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
that makes sense um the um on on this
 
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
chart or table that's on um that she
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
sent to the executive counsel I don't
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
see uh bed counts or bed capacity per
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
facility and I'm understanding from your
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that these 13 add up to a
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
number less than
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
950 they do um so they you're correct
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
and I can get those numbers I didn't
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
have time to um get that um in between
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
what does it feel like to you of the 950
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
is this about 400 of them oh this is all
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
950 there are 950 beds represented here
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
one thing that I should know is that the
 
01:55:13.470 --> 01:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
01:55:16.069 --> 01:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence is a Statewide
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
program they put submited bids for their
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
10 centers which are located within each
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
of the counties so they act so when you
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
see 13 agencies um that particular one
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
represents 10 actual um shelter
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
programs but but they do equal
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
950 so I'm not very good at math I I
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
took $2.5 million divided by 950 and
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
then assumed a 300 day uh year instead
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
what what do you think this really
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
calculates down to then with the 950 2
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
and half million do you assume 365
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
operating days a year in your
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
metric yes I believe that's how we
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
calculated it it's $7 above and beyond
 
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
um so you um I'm not the uh the one who
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
did the calculation but I do know that
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
it was a $7 increase per bed so somebody
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
who's good at
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's yeah
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay and so representative Stringham
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
well I looked at eight and a half
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
million divided by 950 beds so that's a
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
little less than 9,000 a year divided by
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
365 days was $24 51 cents a day so so
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
the current are getting 24 what 60 51 51
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
if I could just interject um this is a
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
15-month contract since it started April
 
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
1st and so that total number of
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
8.5 um gets us uh 15
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
sheet

01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
right uh represent
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
wer so prior to April 1st these beds
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
were getting reimbursed from the state
 
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:19.870 align:start position:0%
were getting reimbursed from the state
at

01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
$8 a night and we go up two and a half
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
times that and we still have a demand
 
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.589 align:start position:0%
times that and we still have a demand
for

01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
more um thank you I want to make sure
 
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on this and it does get
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
confusing the $8 per night per person
 
01:57:41.229 --> 01:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
was um what was in place before the
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
legislature passed the new monies um so
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
as of July 1st it went to
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
$20 um and so once we had the new budget
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
we were able to put those rates
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
immediately into those existing
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
contracts we went out to um procure um
 
01:58:04.109 --> 01:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
but we so it's been $20 since July
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
1st not so not yet a year two and a half
 
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
times increase and now they're coming
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
back for more it seems like they really
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
far I don't know how to respond to that
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
other than the the cost as you heard
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning and what we've
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
calculated is
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
$47 um per person per night um and we
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill it would increase it to
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
$27 so there's still a gap um The Gap is
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
being closed and I think again the
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided this morning
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
um was that these um funds are needed
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
for staff and I know that Rockingham
 
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
County said
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
couple hundred thousand to one of the
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
ones that's in our County as
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
well that would be the other fun so
 
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
right um do you have followup
 
01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.229 align:start position:0%
right um do you have followup
sir

01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:59:12.669 --> 01:59:12.679 align:start position:0%
what what what I understand then is that
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
these 950 beds we don't expect by adding
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
the extra $7 or so per day we're not
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
expecting any new beds to open
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
but what we're looking to do is to avoid
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
losing beds because some of the entities
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
may have to exit the business absolutely
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
how what what is what what's our risk
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
how how big a margin is a risk are we
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
talking about uh of the 13 I you I don't
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
want you to say specifically which ones
 
01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
are vulnerable but do you have a good
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
sense of which one of these are
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to potential um um bankruptcy
 
01:59:55.629 --> 01:59:55.639 align:start position:0%
or whatever the term would be in this
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
world I don't I don't have that
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
information I think um what we want to
 
02:00:04.109 --> 02:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
do and this is included in the bill is
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
to have that so-called fiscal Integrity
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
provision as part of the contracts the
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
amended contracts so that we would have
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
the insight and the financials to be
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
able to understand on a monthly basis
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
how those agencies are doing so we could
 
02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:22.709 align:start position:0%
how those agencies are doing so we could
monitor

02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
um any such circumstance as a
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
catastrophe so did you just suggest
 
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
you'd like us to amend this bill so we
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
put the financial Integrity language
 
02:00:35.069 --> 02:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
into the law it I I believe what is in
 
02:00:39.629 --> 02:00:39.639 align:start position:0%
here is um would um address that I don't
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
see the phrase Financial Integrity
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere right we call it fiscal
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
Integrity in our contract language but
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
essentially that's how we would
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
operationalize um the fact that um
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just what what words say that I'm
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
just missing it and I'm I'm happy to
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
amend this to to to to get what you
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
think makes good managerial sense I just
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
want to give you the
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
tools I'm not I'm not seeing it in the
 
02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.669 align:start position:0%
tools I'm not I'm not seeing it in the
language

02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
though hi Mr
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
White good afternoon members of the
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
committee Nathan white CFO DHHS um the
 
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
the appropriation language that you see
 
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill mirrors the appropriation
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
language that was provided in hp2 this
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
past session the the fiscal Integrity
 
02:01:25.229 --> 02:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
language that Kat is referring to it's
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
part of um some of the internal
 
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
operational uh system of controls that
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
our our centralized contracts unit uh
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
incorporates we actually have a risk
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
assessment process um so in the case as
 
02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
many of you probably recall we talked a
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
lot about subrecipients and contractors
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
during this past budget session um when
 
02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
we do have subrecipients we assess those
 
02:01:50.109 --> 02:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
uh those organizations for a certain
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
level of risk and that's required by un
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
by federal uniform guidance and so when
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
we see more of a a higher risk scenario
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
whether it be Financial or programmatic
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
we go ahead and incorporate some of the
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
standardized language that we've
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
developed to protect the department in
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
in relation to that risk so I don't
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily go ahead that all sounds
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
good but Miss Fox I think just said that
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have visibility of these 13
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
which ones may be vulnerable how how
 
02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:18.679 align:start position:0%
would we assess uh relative risk between
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
these 13 and and therefore assert the
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal Integrity language
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I I'm not trying to be
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
argumented I'm just trying to help you
 
02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
understand I want to understand so we
 
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
can help you get the language the way
 
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
you need it to make this money as as
 
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
valuable as possible well I I go ahead
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry as you said um this bill
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
has been amended several different times
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
so the version that I have in front of
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
me which is 411 2024 which is amendment
 
02:02:51.119 --> 02:02:53.270 align:start position:0%
me which is 411 2024 which is amendment
14

02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
14
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
65 and so it's the one that's um amended
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
by the Senate yeah it does address this
 
02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
by indicating that the department shall
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
require recipients of this funding to
 
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
submit Financial projections covering
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
the term of the contract as well as
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing financial statements
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrating organizational Financial
 
02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
sustainability so that that's lines 8
 
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
through 10 yes okay all
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
right um okay I want to I want to shift
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
gears on you a little bit um I earlier I
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
think we heard that we had um people
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
showing up at the uh shelters with no
 
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
identification and that they're they're
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
receiving uh these scarce valuable
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
resources even though they're not
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
presenting with any identification is
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
that did I hear that
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
right I do not um get into the details
 
02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
of how the programs run but I believe
 
02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's what we all heard this morning um
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
about the housing first model okay so so
 
02:04:01.549 --> 02:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
this confuses me about the utility of
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
the language that's on line seven where
 
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
it says that we we shall prioritize
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
veterans to the greatest extent
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
practical and and so that language is
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
meaningless if we have people who are
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
able to show up and claim a resource
 
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
that might have gone to a veteran
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
that that's my observation tell me if
 
02:04:25.199 --> 02:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
that that's my observation tell me if
I'm

02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
wrong I don't think that I could tell
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
you you're wrong I think that um the
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
idea is that um housing first model is
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
really about harm uh reduction and about
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
making sure people don't die so this
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
language is is useless then is what I'm
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
what I'm picking up is it because the
 
02:04:48.559 --> 02:04:49.629 align:start position:0%
what I'm picking up is it because the
housing

02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
first policy of the federal government
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
overrides six and seven to where line
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
six and seven so that six and seven are
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
just throw away words that mean
 
02:05:03.549 --> 02:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
nothing in
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
practice I think that um I would want to
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
bring that back and see how we would
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
operationalize that with the uh shelter
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
programs I think you heard from families
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
in transition which is still in the room
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
um about the um priority populations
 
02:05:20.669 --> 02:05:20.679 align:start position:0%
that they have which include veterans
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so so if I could just wave a wand
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh I would say I want to prioritize the
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
elderly that are starting to show up I'd
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
like to prioritize the veterans who are
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
showing up and I would like to under or
 
02:05:37.629 --> 02:05:37.639 align:start position:0%
deprioritize anyone without any
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
identification can we do that legally
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
not to say that as a group we agree to
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not there but I just want to
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
know if that would be a legal thing to
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
do I I would not know know how to answer
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
that I would have to um defer to
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
somebody who knows case law and um an
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
attorney likely yeah can can you all
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
take that question back and research
 
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
that because I'd like to take six and
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
seven and I'd like to put some punch in
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
that so that we're we're really
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
prioritizing veterans and the elderly
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
who are showing up um and and and and
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
taking away the resources that are being
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
claimed by people who are showing up
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
without any
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
identification um and I do think that if
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to talk to the
 
02:06:31.549 --> 02:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
shelter programs about what the
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
day-to-day is like and who shows up and
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
how um access is gained to a program um
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
in determining um whether they're
 
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
holding beds for a particular population
 
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
or whether it's first come first Ser so
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I talked for 30 seconds with Maria do
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
I need to talk longer
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
we we we can maybe talk about that so
 
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
okay um so that's that's the whole issue
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
on undocumented in this issue around
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility of low barrier housing um I
 
02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to understand that to
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
see if we have any influence at the
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
state level um because we're crowding
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
out the
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
elderly and the other question I have
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
for you is if we do have an elderly
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
person that's making decent money but
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
still can't afford an apartment in
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
today's crazy rent environment are they
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
able to make a contribution or a
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
donation to help cover some of the costs
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
of the shelter or are we sort of by
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
practice or by law prohibited from even
 
02:07:38.669 --> 02:07:38.679 align:start position:0%
inviting a
 
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
donation I don't believe there's any
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
prohibition against uh such okay but
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably not being done because
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's not expected that these folks would
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
contribute to their own housing
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to the programs to be able to
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
respond to that I think that you'll find
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
um there are instances where individuals
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
have availed themselves of those
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
services and gone on to be able to
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
achieve economic stability who have then
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
come back and contributed sure I'm
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with like the Liberty house
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
model yes so I I like a lot of the
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
Liberty ass model but um and
 
02:08:22.589 --> 02:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
then I really would like to use this as
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
a as an opportunity for the state to do
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
something like a house resolution saying
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we need our federal delegation to
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at the housing first policy
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
if if if we were to make if we were to
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
recommend changes to the housing first
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
policy so that we could have a more
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
sustainable healthier environment and
 
02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
these shelters do you have an idea of
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
two or three things that we might want
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
to suggest gets relooked in the housing
 
02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.510 align:start position:0%
to suggest gets relooked in the housing
first

02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
policy I would have to take that back
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure could could you come back
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
with that you got that Mr White or or Mr
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
Ripple I don't know if you're writing
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
this down or Mr representative Stringham
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
you got these okay somebody's got it do
 
02:09:15.149 --> 02:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
what okay I'll come over okay so we
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
notice that the
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
hospital is concerned if we lose
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
capacity that they're going to get
 
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
further backlog than they already
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
are um so we don't want that to happen
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
we definitely want to keep you guys in
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
business I think um all right so that's
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
really all my questions representative
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
torki did you want to
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
speak well I just didn't know if um we
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
were going to dig a Little Deeper I just
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
had a response or a reflection when you
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about people who showed up
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
without ID the language of the bill
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
actually talks
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
about legally present in the United
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
States those are two different
 
02:09:59.470 --> 02:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
things I'm
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
online8 you're T you know prioritize
 
02:10:03.950 --> 02:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
veterans and shall not knowingly provide
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
services to any person not legally
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
present in the US to me that's two
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
different things people who are
 
02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:12.559 align:start position:0%
houseless are have a higher propensity
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
to not have identification it doesn't
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
mean that they're here illegally so I
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
guess that's just something that we as a
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
group can work out and I didn't know if
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
the um the um women who testified
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about from their facility could
 
02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:27.990 align:start position:0%
earlier about from their facility could
maybe

02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
discuss that if that's a concern of
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
yours no I think it's a great point and
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
the reason I already got myself to being
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable talking about the lack of ID
 
02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
is because I understand that the the the
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
the that every day 138 people line up
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
and they have you know X number of
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
minutes a limited time frame to just
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
check everyone in and and many of them
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
are showing up without ID they don't
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
have a a window of time set up to to
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
formally check eligibility against
 
02:11:02.350 --> 02:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
things like the Medicaid New Heights
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
program or they they they don't have on
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
the ground the ability to check whether
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
or not somebody's in the country legally
 
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
or not that's my understanding I'm
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
seeing a head nod uh but but we can
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
continue that conversation which is just
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
simply to explain I you know I I agree
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
with you in general but from a practical
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
point of view I I I don't know that we
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a different proxy other than to say
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
do you have identification I that's fine
 
02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:34.599 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just concerned about um you
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
know putting people without
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
identification at the bottom of the list
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
be since people who are houseless are
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
often the most likely to not have
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
identification even though they are
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
legal citizens of the United States
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's it I want to make sure that we
 
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
can clarify that when we come to our
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
final product no I I agree and but just
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that because we're we're
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
filling our full capacity we're we had
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that we are uh excluding some
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the elderly and possibly some
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
additional veterans who might be
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for that resource but are not
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
because the room at the end is already
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
taken so if we're really going to try
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
say as a matter of policy we want to
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize veterans and I'd add the
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
elderly uh to that uh policy preference
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
then and we have a scarce finite
 
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
resource how do you shift around the
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
priorities the bill already anticipates
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
that veterans are supposed to be getting
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent practical of
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
priority but but I think we heard that
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
that mean those are meaningless words
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you when you said that
 
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
that line is somewhat meaningless and
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if the original Bill had
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
that or if that was something the Senate
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
added on to try to um set safy
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
someone thank you very much okay so
 
02:12:57.149 --> 02:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
representative H said that that got
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
added on so uh representative
 
02:13:03.069 --> 02:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
wer we heard testimony from some of the
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
people that ran these shelters that they
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
helped people get IDs and I mean I
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%
remember being involved with a veterans
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
program years ago where they had
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
somebody there from the registry of
 
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles and they they could look
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
back if you'd ever had a driver's
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
license and lost it or expired they may
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
find find an old one and oh yeah that
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
looks like you you may be able to
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
reproduce it so you know that's that's
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
also part of the services and if
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and says I lost my
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
wallet all my ID and everything they may
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
be able to reproduce I think that was
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
one of the services we heard was
 
02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
provided so you've got to try to do some
 
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
of that work too as well thank
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
you and I and I would just put out there
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
also that having a valid identification
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
card in our Society the way it's
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
constructed has enormous utility for all
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
ranges of things and so if we're if we
 
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
are experiencing a a class of folks who
 
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
are having trouble having an
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
identification card it's kind of in our
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
interests as a state and as a society to
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
facilitate them getting
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
one I am 100% in agreement with you
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
adjourned oh representative Stringer go
 
02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.669 align:start position:0%
adjourned oh representative Stringer go
ahead

02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh couple questions looking looking at
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
your chart um contract number 12 is the
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
Salvation Army in West nyak New York is
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
that correct do we send uh homeless
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
people out of state as part of the
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
contract now no it's not that's where um
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the Contracting and their Administration
 
02:14:44.549 --> 02:14:44.559 align:start position:0%
is um they serve uh bamp and marac
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
counties thank you and um uh if if we
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
did the math uh or each each one of
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
these contracts have the same day bed
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
rate is that the way the contracts are
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
written or is it just a fixed total
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's based on a lot of different
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
things the contracts are actually
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
written where it's a cost reimbursement
 
02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
basis um and so um it's just easier to
 
02:15:13.629 --> 02:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
convey it and say $20 $27 because when
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
you look at those reimbursements and you
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
average them out they are they come
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
agency follow up yeah a cost based
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement when the cost is 46 and
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
how we how we going to make this work
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
when we're paying half that much or is
 
02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
our expectation that they're getting
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
private donations of a certain amount
 
02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.109 align:start position:0%
private donations of a certain amount
thank

02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
you so um our CFO next to me is we're
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the contract we'll take a
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
look at it and get back to you on that
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
are are there further questions for the
 
02:15:58.549 --> 02:15:58.559 align:start position:0%
Department uh ladies do you want another
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
chance another bite at the Apple to talk
 
02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:02.599 align:start position:0%
to us you talked to us this morning
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
you've heard us yaking a bunch do you do
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
you have something else you'd like to
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
say I I don't have any questions do we
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
have any questions from for the families
 
02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
in transition organization
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
anyone representative stream yeah I just
 
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
wanted a clarification thank you m thank
 
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
you both um um when you said you had uh
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
2.7 million in I think you said in
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
donations this morning those are from
 
02:16:33.389 --> 02:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
charitable would be in addition to what
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
you get under your state
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
contract yes and it actually supports
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
the entire organization so um I believe
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
this morning we handed out a a flyer
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
that had yes so that just covers um the
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
shelters that we run we also run housing
 
02:16:53.309 --> 02:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
and a food pantry as well as a substance
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
use treatment program so that 2.7
 
02:16:55.679 --> 02:16:56.709 align:start position:0%
use treatment program so that 2.7
million

02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
supports all of our programming where
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
there's a gap okay so so while you're
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
sitting there I I asked you offline and
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
and if you could confirm I heard you
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
correctly um due to the way people line
 
02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
up and check in for the for your shelter
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
um I understand it that you have really
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
no practical way in which you could make
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
a a proactive positive check on
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
immigration status that is correct all
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you I will also add um one
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
of the things in regards to veteran
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
status or actually anyone um not every
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
shelter does this but because we run a
 
02:17:39.309 --> 02:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
day program if our participants stay
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
during the day they secure their bed for
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
that night so they still have to go
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
outside to do check-in but they're
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
secured their bed already for the for
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
the upcoming night so when such as a
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
veteran comes in they work with our case
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
managers we know that that person is a
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
veteran or a youth or somebody else who
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
can be better served somewhere else
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's where that information is then
 
02:18:04.589 --> 02:18:04.599 align:start position:0%
given to another organization so
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
veterans would be referred to Easter
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
Seals uh Liberty house another
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
organization and that is through the
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
case management piece it wouldn't be
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
through the piece of an ID um it
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
definitely has to be through the
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
services piece so once the person is
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
actually inside that's the
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
that is the time when we're AB we're
 
02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
able to provide the services that are
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
critical do you have an ID do you have
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
any income do you have your birth
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
certificate all those things to actually
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
get somebody to housing so even checking
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
IDs at the
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
door wouldn't help you get to what you
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
need to get to to get all the services
 
02:18:43.709 --> 02:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
it just would get you in the door if
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's the way it would be
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
written okay hypothetical scenario
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
somebody shows up up they they receive a
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
bed they have no identification mhm but
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
they tell you and they're telling you
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
the truth that they used to have a
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
driver's license but they've lost it yep
 
02:19:04.509 --> 02:19:04.519 align:start position:0%
how long would it take you working with
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
that client to uh obtain a replacement
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license depending on where they
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
got their driver's license new um I
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it takes very long it's
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
really just sitting down with them
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're giving us the
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
right information their birth date
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
everything that they need um this is
 
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
part of the services that we actually
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
will pay for for them to get their
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license or ID non-d driver's ID
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
um their birth certificate social
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
security card anything like that so so
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
something they can get it 90% of the
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
time within a week oh it's probably
 
02:19:40.509 --> 02:19:40.519 align:start position:0%
longer than that that I could ask my
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
case managers it's going to take a
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
little while to get all that three
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
weeks does anyone know how long it takes
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
to get I'm going to say as someone who
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
recently moved to New Hampshire trying
 
02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
to get my New Hampshire driver's license
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
it can take up to 45 days
 
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I was just going to
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
comment though the piece that you just
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
said which was birth certificate the
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
birth certificate is that vital missing
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
piece that many of these people probably
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't have particularly if they were
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
born out of state and that's the
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
challenge is figuring out how to access
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
and have the funds to be able to access
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
it um correct we pay for that yeah so
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
that's the part that could take much
 
02:20:19.479 --> 02:20:21.389 align:start position:0%
that's the part that could take much
more

02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
yes the other difficulty is often in
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
order to get one of these vital
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
documents you often need to already
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
possess at least one of the others so
 
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
when you have someone who has none of
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
these documents it becomes very
 
02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to start that process because
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
if you need your birth certificate you
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
have to need a form of ID already all
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
right and and earlier I asked if you
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
could come up with two or three bullet
 
02:20:48.670 --> 02:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
statements was that you I asked about
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
two or three bullet statements on on on
 
02:20:53.309 --> 02:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
issues within the housing First Federal
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
policy that seem to cause us the most
 
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
aggravation yeah I think um housing so
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of money from HUD right so
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
um we we have to be a housing first
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
organization um if the state grant and
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
aid do provides a different model that
 
02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
would be a contract that we would follow
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
through um the state but our all of our
 
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.790 align:start position:0%
through um the state but our all of our
housing

02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
has to be housing first the reason I
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
wanted the two or three bullets is
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
because I'm toying with the idea of of
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
resolution from the general court to the
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
federal delegation to say please look at
 
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
these issues they're getting in the way
 
02:21:36.750 --> 02:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think for Sheltering I mean
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
it we're like all the shelters who
 
02:21:41.309 --> 02:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
talked this morning are all low barrier
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
shelters and it is really about harm
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
reduction um and it is once somebody
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
gets into a shelter it's then the time
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
to talk with them about where do you go
 
02:21:51.309 --> 02:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
from here cuz this is not where you're
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to live for the rest of your life
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how that would affect
 
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
the Sheltering business per se because
 
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
it is just a place for someone to stay
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
for a period of time but from a housing
 
02:22:07.150 --> 02:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
perspective we're required to be housing
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
first and our money from HUD requires
 
02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
that so and and you gave us a length of
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
state number didn't you an average
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
length of stay what what what it what
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
was it was on our sheet of paper so
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
our family shelter um most of our
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
families are staying between six and 9
 
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
months because there's no place for them
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
to move to and this money goes to those
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
family shelters it does and then our
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
adult shelter is 38 days on average all
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
right the most stay between I I I I
 
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything you all have done
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
to make us Smarter on this thank you so
 
02:22:44.349 --> 02:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
much are there other questions
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative priest could you just
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
clarify that last statement about how
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
many days for adults
 
02:22:54.030 --> 02:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
yes on average we have adults staying at
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
our adult shelter for about 38 days the
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
majority of them though are staying
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 14 days though we
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
certainly have people who stay many
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
months um sometimes even longer um but
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
the average is 38 days okay if we Ser
 
02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
about 850 men and women uh each year
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
through our adult
 
02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
shelter any further questions from the
 
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee any final comments you want to
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
share that we've not asked
 
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
about no we want to representative PR go
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
ahead uh again I'm I apologize for not
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
being here for the hearing I had a
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
municipal to EXA out so um how many
 
02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
families do you see on an average we
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
serve 11 families uh in our building on
 
02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
Lake a um but we have a weight list of
 
02:23:53.469 --> 02:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
62 families currently right now okay um
 
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
but and our families typically stay
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
between six and nine months um because
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
there's very little place for them to go
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anything else I've got
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah all right so with that uh I
 
02:24:10.269 --> 02:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
think we can conclude SB
 
02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
406 and open SB 311 thank you so much
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you all right and you have my card
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to still stay in touch I I
 
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
think no you gave me your
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:27.070 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:24:27.070 --> 02:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
yeah in 15
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
minutes 10 minutes okay I actually think
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
we could be done in 10
 
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
minutes um so who who here from the
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
go go ahead I I think we know who you
 
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
are you've introduced yourself good
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon one too many times huh um so
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
we um just following up on the public
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
hearing there's a there's a couple of
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
members who were not here at the public
 
02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and I just want to provide some
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
context and overview uh the state
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
acquired Hamstead Hospital officially on
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
June 8th of
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
2022 um prior to the acquisition of
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital there were concerns
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
raised from the town relative to the
 
02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
loss of property taxes that the town
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
would experience um at that point in
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
time the parties that were involved had
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
agreed to um make a payment in Li of
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
taxes pilot um to use an acronym not
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we want to use acronyms make this
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
less accessible um and over the past uh
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
two years in state fiscal year um 23 and
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
24 the state made uh payments to the
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
town of approximately
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
80,000 each year slightly less um during
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
the budget process uh during the Senate
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
phase after the house phase there was no
 
02:26:09.630 --> 02:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference this past budget
 
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
um the senate had uh verbally agreed to
 
02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
add uh an appropriation to the budget uh
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
to make payment to the town of Hamstead
 
02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh that that did not make it officially
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
into the budget um so the the sponsor
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Bell um as she spoke ear uh at
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
at the prior public hearing her intent
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
was to include this uh for State fiscal
 
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
year uh this payment um the reason the
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
payment is so precise in in the in the
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation is it basically represents
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
the exact property tax loss of the town
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the three Parcels of land that
 
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
Encompass the H the Hamstead acquisition
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
um one one key piece of information just
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
for everyone's awareness there is a
 
02:26:59.710 --> 02:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
state law that prohibits uh localities
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
from taxing the state um there's an
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
exemption there and uh for context as
 
02:27:08.190 --> 02:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
well the department has submitted
 
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
relative to those payments uh separate
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
requests to the governor and executive
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
Council to authorize those payments
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
which they have done so for the past two
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
State fiscal years um the and I'll pause
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
there for questions so so wouldn't the
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do this in the future
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
is the in the governor's budget phase
 
02:27:32.349 --> 02:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
the Hamstead hospital and eventually the
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
youth development center that is going
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
to be co-located there they're going
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to they should be
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
proposing Monies to that for them to
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
transfer to the town and it should just
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
be part of the budget cycle should it
 
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
not that that could certainly be one way
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
to do it from a transparency perspective
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
let's do that so that the cost of
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital is a fully loaded cost
 
02:27:56.269 --> 02:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
and we're not always doing a side deal
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
let's just put it into the budget since
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
we we're committed to doing it is there
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
is there a better way to do it a more
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
efficient way a more transparent way uh
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
establishing class line is certainly a
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
transparent way to achieve that so yes
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
we're you're we're agreeing that going
 
02:28:13.870 --> 02:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
through the budget is the best way to do
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
it okay a representative H I have two
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
questions sorry for missing missing the
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing um one was
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
this the taxes were calculated on the
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
current value of the property including
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
the buildings but if we do Renovations
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
or build out for the replacement for the
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
cunu center obviously the valuation goes
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
up are we anticipating paying for the
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
new taxes for that new building as well
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
um Can can I answer that I I would hope
 
02:28:46.510 --> 02:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
that the state has staked out the
 
02:28:48.429 --> 02:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
position that we would not that we're
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
replacing the property taxes from the
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
prior owner of the land and our
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
improvements to the land because we're
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
exempt from a property tax perspective
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
should not be factored into a a new
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
higher rate that we should
 
02:29:05.710 --> 02:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
grandfather the the the value and maybe
 
02:29:07.950 --> 02:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
have an inflation adjustment at some
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
point but but I I would not want to U
 
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
I'm with you I'm just checking because
 
02:29:16.429 --> 02:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
do do you have any reasons inequity here
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
for all the other owned government owned
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
properties with all in all the other
 
02:29:23.230 --> 02:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
towns that we suddenly start yes yes sir
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
so so Mr White since you know more of
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the details of the agreements has has
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
this topic come up about future
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
improvements to the property value and
 
02:29:36.269 --> 02:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
what it may do to our payments in Le of
 
02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
taxes I think there have certainly been
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
discussions relative to that um I I
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
think the key question for today though
 
02:29:46.349 --> 02:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
is is is the the the policy question at
 
02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
hand relative to the the immediate
 
02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
payment um there there there is no
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
written mou between the state and the
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
town of Hamstead um but there have
 
02:29:58.750 --> 02:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
certainly been many verbal discussions
 
02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
relative to that
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
right okay okay representative B thank
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair is am I correct understanding that
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
the state does not make any such
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
payments in any other situations such as
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
this the department does not the state
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
does there there are other scenarios
 
02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
where um the state do do make
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
payments can you name some of those um
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
the I know that the department of
 
02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
administrative Services makes a payment
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
to the town of conquer uh to address the
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the loss of revenue from parking due
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
to the general General legisl the
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
general court being in session um I I
 
02:30:42.990 --> 02:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
would I would have to I mean I think
 
02:30:44.429 --> 02:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
we'd have to request from the Department
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
administrative Services a more
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive listing as I'm not fully
 
02:30:49.150 --> 02:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
aware of what other agencies have in
 
02:30:51.790 --> 02:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
their budgets okay I can name another
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
Kevin you want to I did uh request that
 
02:30:56.349 --> 02:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house provide that
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
information he said other than the
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
payment to the city of conquete he
 
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of any and that payment is
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
175,000 annually okay that was Myan as
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
well speaking to him the last week as
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
well so um with that in mind going back
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
to the original discussions about Hamad
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
hospital was this third year part of
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
those original discussions I I first of
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
all may start go backwards my
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding was that there was some
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
discussion of the first two years
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes being included in the
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
original deal is that accurate um I I I
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
think this past year was certainly on
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
the table G given the fact that um we we
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
did make a request during the budget to
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate that um into into this Bania
 
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
okay so so the answer is yes so the
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
question is was is the third year which
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
would be the next one that starts coming
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
up the one we're talking about here
 
02:31:47.269 --> 02:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
right was that included in those
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
discussions not not included in those
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
discussions was was that agreed to when
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
the property was purchased with
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
hamston is what you're implying right
 
02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
well that's who it was purchased from
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes yes yes yes what yes that
 
02:32:03.070 --> 02:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
that was part of the discussions given
 
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
the long-term loss and the impact of the
 
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
town no not part of the discussion it's
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
part of the agreement well there is no
 
02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:09.790 align:start position:0%
part of the agreement well there is no
written

02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
agreement so what in your mind what were
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
the discussions forever
 
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
impu I wasn't privy to those discussions
 
02:32:19.269 --> 02:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
I was not in in my current role so I
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the exact nature of
 
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
them okay but you are speaking to the
 
02:32:26.349 --> 02:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
third year anyway yes I'm speaking to
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
the third year that was requested during
 
02:32:30.429 --> 02:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
the during the budget process and and at
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
the and our
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
expectation based on those discussions
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
what that would be included in the
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
budget during the budget process but not
 
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily during the purchase
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
process during the purchase process and
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear because this did
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
come up and I'm I'm going to answer your
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
question but I also just want to address
 
02:32:52.030 --> 02:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
a a misstatement that or potentially
 
02:32:54.429 --> 02:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding from the last go around
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
um the agreement was between the state
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
and Hamstead Outlook LLC which is a
 
02:33:02.590 --> 02:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
private organization the town was not
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
part of that agreement so there is no
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
legal obligation it however there was of
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
course the um the negotiations between
 
02:33:14.110 --> 02:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
the state and the town and the many
 
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussions uh that have taken
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
place since that point in time based on
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
the loss of property tax revenue and the
 
02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
impact to the town and services so I
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of that and just was
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
number of years part of those initial
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
discussions I I don't think there's been
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
any 5 7 12 15 Nature um to those
 
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
discussions okay thank
 
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
you represent wer I'd like to cite
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
another example that seems to get
 
02:33:45.550 --> 02:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
overlooked in all these discussions of
 
02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
this of the state paying for um loss of
 
02:33:51.790 --> 02:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
of property
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
tax some years ago we were talking about
 
02:33:58.269 --> 02:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts Connecticut River
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
was was damned to protect Massachusetts
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
from flooding and it also involved
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
several flood zones most of them being
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
in handful of of U towns in New
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that because of this agreement
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to close their flood planes to
 
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
development and every year the state was
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
paying property tax reimbursement for
 
02:34:24.910 --> 02:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
the loss of value the towns would
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise have and the reason it came up
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
some years ago was Massachusetts was
 
02:34:34.349 --> 02:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
also supposed to pay for this loss of
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
development and it took about 10 years
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
in a lawsuit to finally collect that
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
money but that was another example of
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
paying for um property tax loss to those
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
towns and I I don't know why the
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
administ of services and all these other
 
02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
people when this question is asked did
 
02:34:56.550 --> 02:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
we ever pay anybody else for Lo loss of
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
property taxes yes and that's probably
 
02:35:01.269 --> 02:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
half a dozen towns so that exists and
 
02:35:02.429 --> 02:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know why it's never
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I brought it up thank
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
you I know representative Stringham you
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
had a question I well I think I think um
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr White answered answered the issue
 
02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
which was I was just going to point out
 
02:35:20.510 --> 02:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
we had separate te testimony that that
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
the the state bought the property from
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hamstead uh Outlook LLC I think it was
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
called and there was there was no
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
agreement at the time of the purchase to
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
cover lost um Lost Property Tax it's
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
like anytime any property converts from
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
a non let's say it's purchased by a
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit institution that doesn't pay
 
02:35:46.590 --> 02:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
profit not not uh required to pay
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
property tax it's something that the
 
02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
towns have to deal with with and um um
 
02:35:55.230 --> 02:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know to the town's credit they
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
brought the issue up and something was
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
worked out so that they had an unu had
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
an unusual payment uh at least by our
 
02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
state standards in the 80,000 and the
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue is um uh whether whether this
 
02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
after the deal um Arrangement should
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
continue for additional years at least
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle and then perhaps in
 
02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:20.910 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle and then perhaps in
perpetuity

02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone you'd want to hear on
 
02:36:25.389 --> 02:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
from on the 29th would you like any
 
02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
representatives from the town of
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
Hamstead to to be invited for example to
 
02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
help us understand from their
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
perspective what they think the
 
02:36:36.349 --> 02:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
agreement was and when it was made it
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
clearly it was all verbal and handshake
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
there's no written document but would
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
would that would that help you
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
understand um yeah I'd be happy to talk
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
to anybody it doesn't have to be
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee but yeah so
 
02:36:57.309 --> 02:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
he's representative Guthrie you're
 
02:36:59.230 --> 02:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're Hamstead selectman is that
 
02:37:02.670 --> 02:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
why you're here yeah Hamstead yes
 
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
Hamstead select
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay no I just thought you were here
 
02:37:09.389 --> 02:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
because you
 
02:37:12.030 --> 02:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
know have a
 
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
seat oh no pleas please please have a
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
seat because we have an interested party
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
right now let's party party so so um
 
02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
what do you think representative Guthrie
 
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
was the understanding of the town of
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
Hamstead as the state moved in and
 
02:37:32.429 --> 02:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
purchased uh the hospital and uh and
 
02:37:35.469 --> 02:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
took Hamstead off the property roles
 
02:37:38.429 --> 02:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
well it on case of the Hamstead side was
 
02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
02:37:42.269 --> 02:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
lobbying and maybe a little bit of arm
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
twisting and hugging with the Health and
 
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services Commission and that's the
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
type of thing it was and it went to uh
 
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
presented by the health and human
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
services to the executive commission
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the support of the governor and it
 
02:37:58.800 --> 02:37:59.950 align:start position:0%
with the support of the governor and it
was

02:37:59.950 --> 02:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
really to to get us over the bump if you
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
will we would all of a sudden here goes
 
02:38:08.830 --> 02:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we don't have and that was
 
02:38:11.550 --> 02:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much what it was and uh my
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
feeling is that uh our request at this
 
02:38:17.550 --> 02:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
time uh shouldn't be connected to
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
anything that's going on in the future I
 
02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
I course I can't speak to it but when
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
they build the facility as we see it uh
 
02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
the impact that that has on our
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
community may you know that's that's
 
02:38:35.550 --> 02:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's a whole new ball game and I I'd
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
be uh wouldn't be fair if you didn't say
 
02:38:41.309 --> 02:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
if I'm sitting here as a as a uh
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
selectman that I wouldn't be advocating
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
for some assistance somehow or other uh
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
whether it be money or other otherwise
 
02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:50.269 align:start position:0%
whether it be money or other otherwise
because

02:38:50.269 --> 02:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:38:53.710 --> 02:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh this does impact uh on our we're
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
already uh uh just last night we have
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
voted to for new uh firemen if we can
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
find them on our in our department we
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
just got a brand new chief on the police
 
02:39:09.630 --> 02:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
and we've put added police officers so
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I it wouldn't be fair that that was
 
02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
caused by Hamstead hospital but the fact
 
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
is uh you know we're going to have to
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
provide service
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak uh for the future and I
 
02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
would not want to be uh tied down to say
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't be in some vehicle here
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
before you sometime in the future asking
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
what can you do for me so I it only fair
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
to say that but I don't think they're
 
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
connected I think this is just the fight
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
that we're fighting today if it is a a
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
dispute represent tki thank you um just
 
02:39:49.399 --> 02:39:50.389 align:start position:0%
dispute represent tki thank you um just
to

02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
clarify what the thought process is Mr
 
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
White can you remind us
 
02:39:59.710 --> 02:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
um House Bill one that this division
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
reviewed was there a line item for this
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
property tax reimbursement and question
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
two was it the Senate that then took
 
02:40:10.990 --> 02:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
that line item out in other words did
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
your department come to us prepared
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
to have the state pay this
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
payment uh I don't think I can answer
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
the answer I wasn't involved in that our
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator blae Dell was the one
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
that was running with the ball was not
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
involved I think the question was
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
White I I would have to go back and and
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
just look at the exact history of the
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
agency um requests that were made at
 
02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
each phase and I I can provide that
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
history okay I just don't want to speak
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
out of turn but that's okay yeah I just
 
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
was thinking forward that if the
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
department put it in the budget and it
 
02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
was removed for whatever reason and you
 
02:40:51.070 --> 02:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
know their plan was that's part of the
 
02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
operating costs for the property moving
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
forward and I think it would instead of
 
02:40:57.630 --> 02:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
talking about this as a oneoff it may
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
help us understand what the Department's
 
02:41:02.269 --> 02:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
view is of the property as a whole that
 
02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
that is part of the expense to running
 
02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
the program that's
 
02:41:12.429 --> 02:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
adjourned all right I hope so any other
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions okay so I I think ready to
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
close uh SP
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
311 and as we close SP 311 I'll just ask
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple if he's got any thoughts on
 
02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:30.760 align:start position:0%

intake these and then on Monday my plan
 
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:16.040 align:start position:0%

02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
want to do with them and and and make a
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full finance
 
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
