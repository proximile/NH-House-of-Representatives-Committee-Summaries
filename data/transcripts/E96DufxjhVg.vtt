Balden for the record my name is Amanda
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
Balden I represent Hillsboro District
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
25 um I sent an email L last night I
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
asked that you either kill this bill or
 
00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
sit on it until the deadline just to see
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the Senate does with HP
 
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
173 and he's not here but I had a joke
 
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
lined up that I won't be taking any
 
00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
questions unless they're from
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
representative Jared Sullivan and the
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
question is I told you
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
so but just to be clear hp1 73 you guys
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
already covered this with an extensive
 
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment and so this isn't necessary
 
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
unless the Senate rejects what this
 
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously passed that passed
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
the house on the third of this month
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay so so well yeah probably would just
 
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
interrupt study it so that we'll see
 
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.509 align:start position:0%
interrupt study it so that we'll see
what

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 align:start position:0%
happens I think you have until March
 
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
21st to vote on this if you want toally
 
00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 align:start position:0%
the Senate will take action before then
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
and this isn't the same as HP 173 but
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's same enough that you can do to what
 
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
you did to HP 173 okay if you want a
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
second bite at the Apple oh I see right
 
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%

you um for hearing my testimony I am
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
Jerry Stringham for the record I'm State
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
Rep uh representing Lincoln Woodstock
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
and Easton a heart of the White
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
Mountains including Lon Mountain
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
Woodstock in and at this time of year
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Ice Castles make a nice place to go
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm serving uh my second term here um
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
I've invested considerable time uh in
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
issues impacting the disabled having
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
been um sponsor four different bills on
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
the disabled and um but my background is
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
is as a business person as a graduate of
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
Harvard Business School uh and I run my
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
own consulting firm for the past 25
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
years which has supported over 2 uh
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
startups in the medical device field um
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
so I understand businesses have many
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
rules protecting workers customers
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors and Society in general that
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
are important but they can be owner as
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
to Implement uh none nonetheless
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
business owners I found are very willing
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
to accommodate reasonable regulations
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
but ask that they be
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh which brings me to HB
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
11117 um uh you know we have you know
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful program uh here in the state
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
and Nationwide uh to support those that
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
are disabled by allowing them to bring
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
service animals uh into our
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
businesses um uh but uh some of the
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them have made it uh
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
difficult for the owners of the
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
businesses to differentiate those that
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
are truly eligible from those that are
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
that are not uh which makes it both
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
difficult for the businesses and for
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
those who truly need uh the access uh to
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
things like a hotel or a restaurant with
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
a service animal so I I view this uh
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as a program Integrity bill so
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
um with that as a background I'll
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
discuss the role of service dogs uh the
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
mandates for businesses created with the
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act the
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
chaos created at certain businesses by
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations by certain dog owners
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
and requests by local businesses from
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
relief from those claiming their pet as
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
a service dog when they're not uh and um
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh they'll also discuss the original
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
Bill and an amendment
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
option um service dogs play a critical
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
role for many handicapped uh individ
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
idual with
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities and to help them live a
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
normal life this includes those
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
suffering from blindness hearing loss
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
and other physical and mental
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities a trained service dog
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
allows a disabled person to live a life
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
in a substantially improved way
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
compensating for these physical and
 
00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:48.310 align:start position:0%
compensating for these physical and
mental

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
mental
 
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.030 align:start position:0%
mental
limitations

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
um mandates to support the access for
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
service animals came nationally with
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities act uh this
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
was passed in July of
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
1990 and is a comprehensive civil rights
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
law for people with disabilities the Ada
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
promises open access to public
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
facilities for those with these
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities among access provided
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
through the Ada is access to hotels
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
stores and restaurants federal law
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
dictates uh largely what is required uh
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
a two-page flyer is available on page
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
one and two of the package that I have
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
submitted this is available uh from the
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Uh current F federal law limit
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
States uh from requiring professional
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
training of service dogs uh requiring
 
00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.829 align:start position:0%
training of service dogs uh requiring
any

00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
license uh of a service dog specifically
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
although other than uh licenses that any
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
other dog would have to obtain and
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
allowing volunteer licensing use of any
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
particular gear so um to be a C A a
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
service dog in New Hampshire you don't
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
have to have the vest on you don't have
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
to have a little
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
tag um and um uh then the requirements
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
are are stated
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
here so I did notice you know I've
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
looked at this thing probably 20 times
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
before I came in here today and on the
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
first page uh on the right side service
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
animals welcome and uh you know there's
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
statement there about it's in it's
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
illegal to misrepresent your dog but it
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
actually says it's illegal to represent
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
a pet as a service animal so uh I think
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
they wanted to say misrepresent and it's
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
a typo and I I just just caught that
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
right before being here today so um but
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
anyway chaos created at businesses uh
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
the net effect of current service dog
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
reg registration is that dog owners can
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
largely self-certify that their dog is a
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
service dog and develop their own
 
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.309 align:start position:0%
service dog and develop their own
criteria

00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
um at least at least as far as
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
approaching a business I received
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
complaints from several business owners
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
about uh the abuse of required service
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
dog accommodation accommodations I'll
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
talk about Igor be he owns the Montag
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
cabins in North Woodstock he Renters of
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
the cabins arrived with their dog and
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
indicated their dog was a service dog
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
later he watched a tape at the front
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
desk where they looked up at the the New
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire flyer provided and realized
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
there was nothing that montop cabins
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
could do and would have to accept their
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
representation uh he is out of the
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
country today or he would have been here
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
to explain how mislabeled dogs have have
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
been left unattended in rooms and bark
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
all day upsetting other
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
customers uh another example is a
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner described how
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
individuals brought a dog into a
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant sometimes with a service dog
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
vest that you can buy at Amazon and
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
proceeded either eat food off the plate
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
of another Patron or go to the bathroom
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
on the floor so um and finally a dog
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
trainer in Conway described the uh the
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
corruption and Chaos brought to the pret
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh PetSmart where she works as owners
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
mislabel their pets as service animal
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
and they proceed to get in fights with
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
other dogs clearly not trained the way
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
that the service dog Provisions uh
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
envisioned uh when put into law in the
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
1990s so the request by local business
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
is um you know all these people admire
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the value of having
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
access to service pets to their
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
establishments however there are dogs
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
gaining access and creating havoc in
 
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.309 align:start position:0%
gaining access and creating havoc in
their

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
businesses um in the case of the
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner she's no longer in the
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant business and she cited this
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
is one of the frustrating realities of
 
00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.630 align:start position:0%
is one of the frustrating realities of
running

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
businesses um
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
so um some some of the more obvious
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
possible remedies were included an early
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
draft of what is now HB
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
11117 uh this bill is introd introduced
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
covers a committee to develop uh active
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
legislation it is not legal to require a
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
service dog be registered unless all
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
dogs are registered all dogs are
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
required to be registered in New
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire once they're four months old
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
so registration is done through the
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
local Town
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
Halls at present most dogs register via
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
an online form uh I put together another
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
possible amendment to this bill uh uh
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
0308 um as a way to expand the current
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
registration to at least um uh provide
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
for people to optionally and on a
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
self-directed basis indicate that their
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
dog their their dog is a service dog uh
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh the in in this bill the the town
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
halls would include a reg would uh after
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
registration include a list of those
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
those dogs that are reg listed as being
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
service dogs and the Department of
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
Agriculture would create a publicly
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
accessible list uh while dog owners
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
could maintain that their pet is a
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
service dog even as if registered as a
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
regular pet when they arrive at a
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant uh it could help facilitate
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh better interaction and discussion
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
when individuals show up uh to make use
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
of the services of our very valuable
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
businesses um in a conversation with
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper he also felt the
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee could authorize the
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
two separate license tags um be created
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
one for service dogs and one for
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
non-service dogs at present at
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
registration we only have uh one style
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
of tag tag again it cannot be required
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
by federal Americans with Disability Act
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh that service dogs have this license
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
but I see it as being friendly to the
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
intent of the Ada uh respectful for
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
those who really need access to the
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
services provided by the service dog
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
provisions and respectful to businesses
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that when a New Hampshire licensed a dog
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
they indicate
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not their dog is a service
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
dog finally with current laws uh uh
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
allow service dogs to avoid paying a
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
license fee uh you have to go to to uh
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh the state house to to get that it's
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
strictly optional it's almost never used
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's necessary uh
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
that that be included in the amendment
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
but that's what came out of um OS when
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
they drafted this uh finally um uh there
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
there may be interest in in uh having
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
individuals uh classify their animals as
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh Comfort animals um which is not
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
service dogs um and um but some people I
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
think naturally U Mis Mis uh construe
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
that their very special dog uh is not
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
just a regular dog even if it's not a
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
service dog and I think having the
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
option of putting something in the
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
middle May
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh even though it carries no legal
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
weight above a regular dog may keep them
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
from check marking a box saying they
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
dog so um
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
Ive I've also included uh relevant
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
sections of the Americans with
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
Disability Act print out on service dogs
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
for your information
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um and as well as you know you have a
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
copy of the bill and the potential um
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um i'' be happy to answer
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
spear thank you just as a question what
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
are other states doing I mean we can't
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
be the only state that's in this do you
 
00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:54.430 align:start position:0%
be the only state that's in this do you
know

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
um you other states have different
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
definitions of what service dogs are but
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
it seems like every you know I went I
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
went through um um you knows and the
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
research support and there wasn't a good
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I should uh back up
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
my question by saying that my whole
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
career was an equal opportunity law
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
first in uh with the state of New
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then with the federal
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
government so I I know something about
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
this um and my question is um uh since
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
you're considering um this
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
optional uh special kind of registration
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
as perhaps a deterrent to people
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
incorrectly um misrepresenting their
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
dogs um uh which I agree has has been a
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
problem both for people uh both for
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and for people who have
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
actual service dogs um and and um you
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
know want to be sure that that's
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
recognized but might not the existence
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
of that special
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
registration um result in business
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
managers um uh
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
incorrectly um uh taking the position
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
that a dog without that special tag uh
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
or other special
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
identification uh in fact is not a
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
service dog and therefore does not have
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
to be allowed where a service dog could
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
go well I the the owners I've talked to
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
have you know seen seen materials like
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
put out by the state so
 
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.750 align:start position:0%
put out by the state so
um

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know if the law is that they
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to have that it's just some
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
certific ification that gives them more
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
confidence that these people actually do
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
have a service dog so I um uh the
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
business owners I've talked to didn't
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to think that was uh I mean
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
they they understand the restrictions of
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
the federal law that a certification is
 
00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:17.950 align:start position:0%
the federal law that a certification is
not

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
required other questions so um this
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
ironically uh this past week I was
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
confronted with a situation where I just
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
looked checked out my email and they did
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
use the term service dog and um in this
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
case I I do have a vacation rental and
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
um and the uh people should uh and I had
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
two different
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
customers and uh and one of them said
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
well fine we'll just do business
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else okay because we said no
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
no dogs right and then the other one
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
said well gee I thought everybody had to
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
take service
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
dogs and so so I was thinking okay so
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
now we need to explain to this person
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
the difference between a service dog and
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
a comfort dog but my wife said no no
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to remind them that vacation
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
rentals are
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
homes and anybody's allowed to borrow a
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
dog from their home even a service dog
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
right and a real service dog can be
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
borrowed from somebody's home and that
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
that was the tax he took and the person
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
then came back and said well we do have
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
an RV and we could keep the dog in the
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
RV well obviously that is no longer a
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
service dog if the dog is in is going to
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
be left inside an RV so that subject was
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
ended so I guess really to tell you that
 
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
yes I I understand the stress but I you
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
know mean I myself personally um you
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
know my my original mother-in-law she
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
she was deaf and she had a service dog
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
so I knew right way back I mean I'm
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
talking 30 years ago about service dogs
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
and d a service dog has a special jacket
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
it literally says do not touch meh okay
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
that so that there's plenty of giveaways
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
if you see a dog that whether it's a
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
service dog or a comfort dog Comfort
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
dogs usually don't have that jacket on
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
they have some f cat on or something
 
00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
something related to the weather so so I
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
guess my my problem is is that is
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
understand so this legislation you want
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
to have is for hot tellers to who are
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
uninformed who don't know the law and
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
that you want to have us pass some kind
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
of legislation to better inform them or
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
give them a better way because all they
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
have to do is say well if it's a service
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
dog you know obviously they can't ask
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
the person with their handicap cap is
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
but they certainly can say is where's
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
the dog certification and why doesn't it
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
have the have that special jacket on
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
there that says do not touch me so I
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm trying to you that's if
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
you are hoping legislation is going to
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
come out of this study committee that's
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
what I was hoping the you know the they
 
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
they a service dog does not have to wear
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
a service vest it does not have to be
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
professionally certified you can if you
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
have a sore back
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
I'm just give an example you have a sore
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
back and you teach your dog to pick up
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
your napkin if you drop it you can then
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
make the certification that that dog is
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
now handling an essential function for
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
you and that's a service dog and um and
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
you you know the the the the federal
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
laws have you know don't give us a lot
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
of leeway to um put a lot of
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions on
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
on um what is required for a service dog
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
to be a service dog uh such that um
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
um uh you know hotels are are required
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
to provide access for them until they
 
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
to provide access for them until they
misbehave

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
misbehave
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Gibbs has a
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you uh thank you uh
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%

in this field for many years um and that
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
is that anyone who is thinking of um
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
excluding a dog that has been identified
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
as a service dog whether it has a
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%

you would you
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
believe okay representative
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
Grassi would you believe that I'm on
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
Amazon right now and I can buy a nice
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
vest and a card and a thing a tag that
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
says access granted by federal law for
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
less than $19 and I could put it on my
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
cat and call them a service dog I
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
suppose service cat um what service it's
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
in Amazon unfortunately I've got it
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
blown up to a size check the mice in the
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant in the hotel Back Down size
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
there we go I mean it's there are all
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
kinds of things you can buy and having
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
worked in the in the transportation
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
industry this is a big problem that we
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
have I mean I had somebody come up with
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
a little and we I I work in a bus bus
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
business yeah go right and the thing is
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that I've had people come up with
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
chihuaha and say this is a service dog
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
and you know you can't argue with them
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
in most cases because if you do they sit
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
there and they threaten you and it would
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
be nice that if we had places that had
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
assigned posting particularly with how
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
much of a fine you could get if you misr
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
I had somebody say that their boa
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
constrictor was a was a comfort animal
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
and of course Comfort animals are not
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
covered under Ada but the thing is is
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
that people think they
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
are right that was a would you believe
 
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
would you believe yeah but here's the
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
problem would you believe the federal
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
government says we can't require
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
anything to prove it yeah so we're we're
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
in a pickle here okay next question
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
represent Ammon thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
you for presenting this bill to us I'm
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
just doing some uh research on my laptop
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
here I Google it so I'm looking at the
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
US service animals uh.org it's the
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
official service and support animal
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
registration and there's a couple
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
paragraphs here it says it's illegal to
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
ask the Handler to demonstrate the
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
abilities or training of the dog yeah
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'll get to a question but I
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
just want to set it up here so I'm
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
looking at usservice animals.com it's
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
the official registry of uh service and
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
support animals and it says it it's
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
illegal to ask the Handler to
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the abilities or training of
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
the dog even if you don't see the dog
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
performance task the Handler also does
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
not have to produce any proof or the
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
dogs of the dog's training and you are
 
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
not allowed to ask about it and then
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
another paragraph says there is no
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
registration requirement or
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
certification progress Pro process for
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
service dogs the Ada states that any
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
required registration or certification
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
would be considered a form of
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
discrimination service dogs don't have
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
to have any form of identification
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
labeling them as a service animal so I
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
guess my question is if the Ada says
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's discrimination to ask how can we
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
enforce it
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
that that was my point yeah I mean I
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
think this is the kind of problem that
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
the the business owners have they're
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
told uh um only two questions may be
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
asked is the dog required because of a
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
disability and what task or work has the
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
dog been trained to perform oh you are
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask those question you are
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask those questions but you
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
can't ask to prove prove the trick you
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
can't ask them to prove it and um uh and
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
you know if they can't answer it I don't
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
know what that means so you are someone
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask the persons what their
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
handicap is because you're asking what
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
what your with the TK that makes some
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
sense because if the handicap is
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
something that you would have to make
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
additional compensations for as the
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
business owner right it it might be we
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody with a bad back
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
you'll complain about our
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
beds yeah you need extra extra firm
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
cushions right or mattresses so um and
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
you can't require you can require dogs
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
to be licensed but it's optional whether
 
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
whether they want to uh you can make it
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
an option for them to to make it a to
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
register as a service dog so that's
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's kind of why I came into the we we
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
we do require dogs to be licensed in the
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire every every year
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
and um but that doesn't mean they the
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
dog comes you renters my renters a lot
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
are mostly out of state that's true and
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's true we can't we can't require M
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
require require the dogs to be
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
registered they may come from
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or you said most of your
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh out of state yeah most of mass is I
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
get a lot of mass customers okay
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs again yeah thank
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
you um would you believe that a
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
Chihuahua can be a service dog for
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
instance um there are people who suffer
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
seizures of various types
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
and there are dogs that are trained and
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
I cannot tell you how this works but I
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
know that this this this is factual
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are dogs that are trained to
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
recognize when a seizure is coming on
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore in some way bark or do
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
something to warn the person uh the
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
dog's owner uh that the seizure is
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
coming on and thereby the person could
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
for instance sit down or lie down on the
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
floor and avoid getting injured so this
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
is is is more complicated uh than it
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
appears years um and also uh would you
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
believe that while it is legal to ask
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
what task the uh dog is trained to
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
perform that is different from asking
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
what the disability is that the dog is
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
trained to assist and it is not legal to
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
ask uh what the disability is thank
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
you okay so let me say Okay um juvenile
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
diabetes dog is trained to smell smell
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
your blood sugars that's right okay so
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to say what is the dog what
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
is the dog capable of doing the dog is
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
capable of of smelling whether I'm
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
having a diabetic attack you can't ask
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
insulin show me that you really do have
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
juvenile diabetes no you really
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
can't I think there's nothing we can do
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem but I I guess
 
00:57:56.109 --> 00:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
we'll look at your
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment see if that's somewhere we can
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
chase but
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think the just looking at
 
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
this um print out uh the F $1,200 can
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
you just post that as far as I know it's
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
it it um uh and and I did if you there's
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
a a sheet of uh near the back it's a
 
00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:19.710 align:start position:0%
a a sheet of uh near the back it's a
full

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
page um that you know I did locate and
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh one of one of the uh the cabin owner
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
does post this now it's sitting on the
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
counter on the front desk even even even
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
if nobody's ever been fined under this
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
provision right but somebody had a
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
decent idea to at least
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well this is great I got two
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
customers I can email this picture
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
to before they decide to get too mad at
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
as for our decision all right thank you
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
very much thank thank you for
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
considering this and go ahead question
 
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
oh we do have a another question
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
represent spe what what does disruption
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
mean I've been in restaurants where dogs
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
have just started barking and barking
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
and barking and they're wearing the vest
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
I remember one dog specifically wearing
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
the vest but it's just sitting there
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
barking and barking and it's kind of
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
annoying to everybody and very
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive that ain't a service if it's
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
sparking it's not a service animal I
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me it's not a it's not a
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
real a real one oh everybody knew it
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't real but how do you kick them out
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
you tell them say it's a $1,200 fine
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think it's time for you
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
when your your dog leave otherwise uh we
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
will pursue this $1,200 fine restaurants
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
are allowed to
 
00:59:42.029 --> 00:59:42.039 align:start position:0%
allow uh animals into their facility
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's their choice and we're not trying I
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm not trying to address
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
those that that uh may have a policy to
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
allow non talking about the disruption
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
dogs yeah I mean
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
um okay go ahead representative
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
Walsh uh I guess my question is even
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
with this and in representative Spear's
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
example what is the business owner's
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
recourse to to go through with this
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
because they would have to prove that
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
that dog wasn't a service dog so how do
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
that representative Gibbs uh thank you
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
um again I think I can help out a little
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
bit with the earlier point about
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
disruption and speaking from um uh
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
having worked with this issue regarding
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
housing and that is while a uh landlord
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
cannot exclude either a service animal
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
or uh a comfort animal for a genuine
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
disability uh if the animal misbehaves
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh for instance barks all night and
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
keeps all the all the other tenants up
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
or uh does its business um on the
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
walkway and the owner doesn't remove it
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh in a reasonably prompt fashion uh all
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
of those things would be violations of
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
the lease and the landlord could take
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
the normal actions that a landlord could
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
take uh regarding any violations of the
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
lease so similarly um if the um uh
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
service dog uh interferes with the
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
normal operations of the business um the
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
owner would have the rights that the
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
helpful I would add you can do the same
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
thing to an unruly Patron
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%

01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%

bill good morning Mr chairman members of

the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
Association uh from the uh breadth of
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion I'm I'm sure you're
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
surprised we're in support of this this
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
has been a massive challenge for our
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
industry to deal with over the last
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
number of years but particularly since
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
the pandemic it has just spiral into a
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
massive issu for for our business
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
members um a lot of good discussion with
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
the committee but i' I'd like to kind of
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
give a couple of examples and kind of
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
walk you through some things and I'm not
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
going to purport that I know what the
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
answers to this problem are but I will
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
tell you that that is a very uh
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
significant problem so uh couple things
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
that were brought up specifically that
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know uh somebody comes to your front
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
desk as a restaurant and they present
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
that they have a service animal
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
obviously our our members and by the way
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
we put out regular Communications on
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
this particular issue because we get
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
phone calls on this issue all the time
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
um and so you know they will ask the two
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions is this a service animal the
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
answer is always yes yes it's funny how
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
few people show up and say no and then
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
the question is uh so what what service
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
does this animal perform for you and
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
usually immediately you will know
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a service animal
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
because the people that it is a
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate service animal are happy to
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
have that discussion with you they
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
understand the challenges of business
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
the animals are well behaved it's
 
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
usually not a problem with those folks
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
it's the folks that are coming in with
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
their pets or you know so-called uh
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
Comfort animals um they get up in arms
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
and they start stamping their feed and
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
they huff and they puff and they carry
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
on um I'll share a story with you in a
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
minute of an instance which I thought
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
was just uh even above and beyond that
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
but um but there's a couple of issues
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
that arise from this right so as a as a
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant you have a food license under
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
State Statute if you have a food license
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
on your premises you cannot have
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
anything other than a service animal in
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
your restaurant a couple of years ago
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
this legislature did uh allow for dogs
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
in outdoor patio areas but it had to
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
have outdoor access at could not go
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
through the restaurant so that puts
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
these restaurants in rather a quandry
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
because if they allow something in that
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
this person said yes it's a service
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
animal this this animal does X for me we
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
can't ask anything beyond that now you
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
have an animal in the restaurant that uh
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
is doing goodness knows what eating from
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
plates you defecating there's all kinds
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
of things that happen and so you know
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
obviously at that point the restaurant
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
can take some action to then eject the
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
the person but the real issue with us
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
from there is social
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
media now you're getting tried in the
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
court of public opinion and you know
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
people don't bother to share that it's
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
not really a service animal I just want
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
to take my pet to lunch right no they
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's always a case of you know we
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
ejected etc etc usually it triggers some
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
sort of an investigation um it creates a
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
huge headache for for our business
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
members um you know I spoke to a
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
gentleman yesterday who shared a story
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
with me that I'll share with you but he
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
said that you know since the pandemic
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
you know prior to the pandemic over his
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
busy summer season he might have two or
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
three service animals now it's every day
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
and sometimes two and three times a day
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
and it's to the point where people will
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
even after he said nope we don't allow
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
anything other than service animals in
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
here that they go around the building
 
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to toss them over the
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
fence into the uh outdoor patio area
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
even though he said we don't allow that
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
um but this is the story he shared with
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
me yesterday and he was obviously quite
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
upset about it and this happened last
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
summer but he said that he had a woman
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
come to the front desk and represent
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
that that she had a service animal he
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
asked the question well what does this
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
animal perform for a service and she
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
just started huffing and puffing and
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
said I'm going to call the police and D
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
never did answer the question he said
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
well I welcome and by the way he has the
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
sign in the window that says is a $1,200
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
fine for misrepresenting your animal so
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
she called the police police came filled
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
out a report said she claims it was a
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
service animal he claims it's not a
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
service animal they've denied entent Etc
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
and so uh the owner of the business
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
asked the police officer so what what
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
happens now and he's like it's out of my
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
hands it's a civil
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
matter so as a police officer he can't
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
do anything about it either which I
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
think really gets to the heart of the
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
problem we have a $1,200 fine on the
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
books that nobody actually enforces so
 
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure what the recourse of
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
the business owner is at that point but
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
to take it a step further uh honor about
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
November 1st he said he received a
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
letter from an attorney saying that uh
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
they he needed to uh send a check for
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
$330,000 to Plate this woman and make
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
the problem go away or they would bring
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the Federal authorities so he reached
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
out to his attorney so now he has
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
attorney costs he's got time effort and
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
resources invested in this thing
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately his attorney advised him not
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
to do anything because ultimately looked
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
like this was a case of somebody
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting of course he's heard
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
nothing since but but you understand the
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
frustration of a business owner who now
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
has dedicated I can't even tell you how
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
many hours uh you know heartburn police
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
officers times they have you know you
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
have social social issues or cost in
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
involved you have attorneys fees threats
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
he's so this poor business owner is just
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
trying to run a restaurant but this is
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
what he's dealing with you know and it
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
happens on the hotel side just as
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
frequently if not more frequently um and
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
now you have a situation where you know
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
most hotels would they make attempt to
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
if they have service animals try to keep
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
them in certain rooms so that you don't
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
have these allergy issues you can't you
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
can't restrict them from being in a
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
specific room but most of them are
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
pretty accommodating and they they're
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
fine so you you try to limit it to you
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
know 20% of your rooms um but then
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
obviously you have these situations
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
where you know people are showing up
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
with pets they're sneaking them into
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
rooms now you have a room that you
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
thought was allergen friendly is not
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
allergen friendly then you have a
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that comes from that so this is
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
a major headache for industry um I don't
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
again I don't pretend to have the
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
answers to this problem but I I I really
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on behalf of the
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
industry because outside of a few wage
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
and hour issues this is becoming rapidly
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
becoming one of the number one issues
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
for our business members to deal with so
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I would uh strongly urge you to
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
essentially develop this uh study
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
committee let's work on this issue let's
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
get some smart people in a room uh you
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
know bring all the stakeholders into the
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
room to to try to figure out I don't
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
know if there's anything we can do but
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it would be fantastic if
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
we could do something even if it was as
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
simple as somebody was in empowered to
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
enforce the $1,200 fine I think that
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
would be a huge step forward because
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
right now it's it's a statute that has
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
no teeth and to add on to one question
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
earlier the um the placard that was
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned in previous testimony um I
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
think it was a year or two ago the
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
legislature actually authorized uh
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
food safety division to develop those
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
placards and share them with the
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
industry we send them out on a regular
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
basis at least once a quarter um to put
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
them in the windows have them on display
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
Etc and clearly that has done nothing to
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
help us U I'll also say two last Quick
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
points the first one is one of the
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
issues that we deal with as an industry
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
is obviously we have a lot of out ofate
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
visitors and in some states like
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they've given protections
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
to comfort animals well then people from
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts think that the Comfort
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
animal is therefore it's the same thing
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
as a service animal it is not and so now
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
we have to explain those situations so
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's a problem that you know sometimes
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
it works out sometimes not so much
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
um forgot my last point so oh and the
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
other issue is the retail sector has
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
really compounded this because they
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
basically said Uncle when I going to
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
deal with it bring all the animals you
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
want into the building well so that has
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
just made it even worse because now they
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
think that they have free right to take
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
their animals anywhere they please and
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
there is no restrictions when in actual
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
fact it actually creates problems for
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
particularly restaurant owners with
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
their food safety license all right I
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
will get off my sot boox and thank you
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
for your time happy to try to answer any
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions um so but the idea that that
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
we have all the smart people in the room
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
is a great idea uh but uh we not ones to
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel so um before we take
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
action on this bill can you find some
 
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
action on this bill can you find some
state

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
law find some other
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
state I will do my best yes I because I
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
don't I the idea of creating this Comm
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know study committee and and have
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
them go through all this and angst and
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
knowing you know that that sound to me
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds unsolvable but it's and I and
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
obviously firsthand experienced with it
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
but so I some some state has got to
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
solve it if they haven't then then it it
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
seems like U an act of fertility
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
I will uh yes and I will do some due
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
diligence and I will see what I can find
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
and bring back to you uh hopefully kind
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
of move this forward but um I will also
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
say that based on your personal example
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I suspect that could have become a
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
problem if they were actually service
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
animals because you're renting it out to
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
the public therefore it kind of changes
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
the rules under the Ada correct um
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
smarter people than I may be able to
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
answer we would hold out that we're a
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
house we're a
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
home just know that discussion when it
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
comes to Vacation Rentals which will'll
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
be continue to discuss in this committee
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
okay representa Aman thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
I was just curious if you have seen the
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and if you had any I have not
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment I do not have an
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
opinion on it at this point yes but I
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
plan to get a copy and review thank
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
you representative pelli clarifying
 
01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.870 align:start position:0%
you representative pelli clarifying
question

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
please until so I just want to make sure
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
I understand until some of the federal
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
laws are updated
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
that we're in this kind of uh precarious
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
position that we're really not able to
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
make any effective changes that would
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
not exacerbate the problem is that a
 
01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.310 align:start position:0%
not exacerbate the problem is that a
fair

01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
statement that's where you're getting
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
into legal and not being an attorney I
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know necessarily speak
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
out a turn I suspect that certain broad
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
parameters will not you can't really
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily mess with those what I'm not
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
sure about is can you enforce what
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
you're on your books aka the 12 $0000
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
fine for misrepresenting an animal uh
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
you know licensing registration type
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios all their other activities
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
that could take place that would ease
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
the burden Andor uh deter folks from
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting at least to some degree
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh versus where we are right now and
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
again I'm not an expert I I can't really
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
speak to that but I would hope that
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
there might be some small steps we could
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
issue representative Gibbs now am I got
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
it right this
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
here where it says here office
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
Governor's Commission on disability is
 
01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.310 align:start position:0%

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
meiss

01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
govern okay what I was going to ask um
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh in reference to the proposed study
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh as it is um stated in the
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill uh it
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
refers to membership being members of
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate and what I was
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
going to ask is would it be um would it
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
be agreeable to you if um in addition to
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
members of the house and the Senate
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
there were to be uh representatives of
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders for instance uh
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
representatives of the hospitality
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
industry and also representatives of the
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
disability Community as specifically uh
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
a a representative of the governor's
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
commission um uh on disability and also
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
a representative of an organization such
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
as Granite State Independent
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
Living frankly we'd have no issue with
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
that I think uh all those stakeholders
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
would likely be involved in the
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee hearings themselves so I think
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
you know tomato tomato but but if you do
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
that I would also encourage that we
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
include somebody from the retail sector
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
because that obviously is a huge issue
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
for them as well although most of them
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%

away for the record representative Cole
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1090 FN repealing the
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
requirement to register a farmers market
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
as a trade name like to recommend

itl any questions based on the sponsors
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%

chairman do we do we have any idea um
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
what the original intent was because in
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
principle it doesn't sound like a
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
terrible idea to repeal a requirement to
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
register Farmers Market as a trade name
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
like that sounds like maybe a good thing
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
but I have no idea on the background of
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
this spell okay so evidently I did
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
receive this January 7th is that the one
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're asked the sponsor okay so uh I I
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
so did I forward that to you okay so I
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
forward it to you so you actually have
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
this already Shazam and it says um the
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%

definition of a farmer market were
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
recently made and as a result the
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
proposal to repeal is no longer
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
necessary the statute needs to remain as
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
is in the grand scheme of proposed
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
homade food laws in the farmers market
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%

01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
move this okay so um
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
ISC I need oh we can't do this do it
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
when we ex all right
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
fine okay we're done so um just so
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
everybody knows I've always had the
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
habit of um not I disagreeing with the
 
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
idea of killing a bill on the same day
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
is the hearing I've always said every
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill should have 24 hours um before it
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
gets to death now so so at this point
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know we do when we do have our exec
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
um I I partly thought about doing an
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
exec session for Thursday afternoon but
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not think that's going to happen um
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
we will be exec next week okay and I
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out exactly what our
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
calendars but I would at this point I'm
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
um that would probably will schedule
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittees for Wednesday morning and
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
then exact on Wednesday
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay and so therefore and and
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
the bills that on was is certainly all
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
the early bills I want to get all you
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
get all the early bills out of out of
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
committee um and um so if you you still
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
have that original spreadsheet I sent
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
out it does say early which ones are the
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
early bills um I think we pretty much
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
have done all the subcommittees on them
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
but I will make sure that we will have
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
done those um I know we're you know we
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
are doing some
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um obviously this
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon Tuesday and so I will be
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
schedule for Tuesday so Tuesday I say um
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
I still want to be Tuesday Wednesday
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
Thursday I'm still want to stick to that
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
program um and at this point I would try
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
I know I'm we're down to one day left of
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
of hearings so I'll look and see what we
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
have for stuff to exec make sure we have
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
enough you know get the early bills out
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday if not if there's and like
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
the cannabis bill I'm just to have a
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
just to play play this out loud the
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill probably will have another
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay and so that would be
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
we would either do that Tuesday or do
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
that Wednesday morning but that would be
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
cutting it down cutting it close for
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
executive it so I might not do it that
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
way um we're really in no pressure now
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
to get and that so that last day that's
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's day number nine so after that
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
then we've done all our hearings which
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
is uh remarkable that we were able to do
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
it so efficiently um and uh so but so I
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
would just say be be be planning on next
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and Wednesday there will be
 
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittees potentially hearings
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
potentially maybe a half days of
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
hearings um and then and then we will be
 
01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
but definitely will exact I would say
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon now um having said
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful if anybody who
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
wants to uh bills that we have that
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be executing to know who
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
would like to make the motion uh you you
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
those of you on that subcommittees that
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
that help there would be you can make a
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
motion it would be helpful um so anyone
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
who wants to um take make the Motions
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
please let me know um and but I have
 
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
been ordered and no un certain terms
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
that if you do make the motion you're
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
not allowed to leave the room until
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
you've written the blur
 
01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
you've written the blur
so

01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
that am I am I quoting correctly I'm
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
sure be up to the Chairman's
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
descrip so normally I would would I
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
would say you know write it you know go
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
home write it on your computer and send
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
it to me but um they want to be very
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
strict about this about getting these
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
BBS done in time time because evidently
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
other committees have been very sloppy
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
about that so what I would urge you
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
again and and if you really want to make
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
my day look at those bills that we're
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
going to sub and decide which ones you
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
want to let me know and write the blurb
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and that way you can email
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
me uh as we execute and that and then we
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
won't neither one of us will get in
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
trouble for not getting it done on time
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
do you want us to email you that we want
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
to write on something or do it on your
 
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
computer right if you if you if you like
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
to make the the motion we can do it by
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
email to tell you you just tell me he
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
you want to do it and be semi semi it
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
should be people from the
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay then I just heard that um I
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
will be looking to you to be making some
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
motion you are your members will be
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
making motions to take up action Y okay
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I can think I can think
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
one that's that that you guys made the
 
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:12.030 align:start position:0%
one that's that that you guys made the
motion

01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
on we would we would be executing on
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
Wednesday okay okay so certainly on
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I'll be you know trying to
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
gather out because I want you know do a
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
do be able to get out early on Wednesday
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
because we'll have everything exact and
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
quickly all right any
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
other okay so I guess we're done for
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
hearing today and and uh if you want to
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 03:27:00.030 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:27:00.030 --> 03:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the room we will invite him to come
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
up and speak uh because he was the chair
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the Cannabis commission that uh
 
03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:11.950 align:start position:0%
of the Cannabis commission that uh
started

03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
started
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
thing this whole ball rolling so good
 
03:27:21.189 --> 03:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
abis good afternoon uh Senator Daryl
 
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
abis I represent District 22 serving the
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
communities of pelum Salem Aon and
 
03:27:31.389 --> 03:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
plastow uh I was the chair of the
 
03:27:33.550 --> 03:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
commission this summer I had the
 
03:27:35.229 --> 03:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
privilege of sitting with representative
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
Sullivan that am I'm missing anyone
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
that's on the committee but I want to
 
03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank everyone for hearing me out today
 
03:27:47.189 --> 03:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
anyway I did go back and was strongly
 
03:27:49.150 --> 03:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
recommended I watched the last uh
 
03:27:52.189 --> 03:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
Hearing in this committee about what the
 
03:27:54.189 --> 03:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
commission did and did not do and what
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
and I feel like I could since I was
 
03:27:58.229 --> 03:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
there I could provide you some insight
 
03:28:01.950 --> 03:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
on what was talked about so initially we
 
03:28:04.349 --> 03:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
were looking at a state control model
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
basically mirroring the liquor system
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we kind of transitioned that to a
 
03:28:12.349 --> 03:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
franchise model now I will say that you
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
can call whatever you want but if it's
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
an agency Outlet my understanding that
 
03:28:19.110 --> 03:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
getting when you get all these people on
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
the same page and from
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
different different chambers different
 
03:28:24.910 --> 03:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
bodies different branches of government
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
and you start changing Provisions the
 
03:28:28.429 --> 03:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
problem is the whole house of cards
 
03:28:30.389 --> 03:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
collapses there's Provisions in here
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm not
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily supportive of not my first
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
choice but it was part of a very
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
difficult compromise that has been more
 
03:28:41.630 --> 03:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
than a year in the making so even if
 
03:28:43.030 --> 03:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
something's in here that I I'll give you
 
03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
an example the 15
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
stores not my favorite provision my
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is if you deviate from
 
03:28:52.110 --> 03:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
that to even 16 this whole thing will
 
03:28:55.309 --> 03:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
fall apart I just that's how it is uh
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
the number was lower we got it up to 15
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
so you can
 
03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
imagine how that was working out so the
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
idea is to start slow and you could
 
03:29:05.590 --> 03:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
always expand on that but if you move
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
too fast you can't really go backwards
 
03:29:09.790 --> 03:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
so really is airing on the side of
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
caution uh the future legislators will
 
03:29:13.630 --> 03:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
always be allowed to change that number
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
as they see fit we won't have these
 
03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
stores won't realistically open within
 
03:29:20.229 --> 03:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
the next uh couple years anyway so it's
 
03:29:22.030 --> 03:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
not something that's I would say an
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
urgent thing to deal with but the Dual
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
use concept uh we as a commission were
 
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
very clear that we were not going to go
 
03:29:31.550 --> 03:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
in that direction to allow the Dual use
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
license for both a therapeutic facility
 
03:29:36.990 --> 03:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
and a retail store instead what we
 
03:29:39.229 --> 03:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
decided was why not allow every retail
 
03:29:41.950 --> 03:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
store to sell therapeutic grade product
 
03:29:43.710 --> 03:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
it would kind of make sense that you
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
would have it that way we didn't we
 
03:29:47.830 --> 03:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
didn't want um any retailer to have an
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
unfair Market advantage over another one
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
and that was where the disagreement was
 
03:29:54.750 --> 03:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
being raised so when we discussed that
 
03:29:57.389 --> 03:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
it said well would that benefit the ATC
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
program perhaps because they'll have
 
03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
more uh places to distribute their
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
product it seemed like we would limit
 
03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing they would kind of be
 
03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
grandf followed in as the only
 
03:30:10.590 --> 03:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of therapeutic gr product
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
but that to put us in a position where
 
03:30:14.349 --> 03:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
not one single retailer had a market
 
03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
advantage over the other when you when
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
you're a franchisee and you have a
 
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
franchise or you're kind of all working
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
together as a team and you really don't
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
want one to have be superior to the
 
03:30:27.309 --> 03:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
other uh we we were not going to
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislate and it was I think the
 
03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
commission was in full agreement we were
 
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
not going to guarantee any individual or
 
03:30:37.189 --> 03:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
entity a license to be a franchisee now
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
there is a criteria in place for what it
 
03:30:41.710 --> 03:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
would take that what would be be put
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration I believe when
 
03:30:47.389 --> 03:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh the very first hearing we had uh the
 
03:30:48.990 --> 03:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh the chairman of the The Liquor
 
03:30:51.150 --> 03:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
Commission came in and testified to what
 
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
that criteria would look like on paper
 
03:30:56.349 --> 03:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
an ATC would obviously be very favorable
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
to that but it wasn't going to we
 
03:31:00.630 --> 03:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
weren't going to legislate and guarantee
 
03:31:02.670 --> 03:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
an entity a license when especially when
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to limit the amount of
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
licenses we thought that wasn't good
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislation if we put that in any other
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
context I mean any one of you want a
 
03:31:10.670 --> 03:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
license I might want I might want to be
 
03:31:13.389 --> 03:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
Afra anise that would be absurd to put
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
that into legislation but if we go down
 
03:31:16.349 --> 03:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
that road we felt that that was not the
 
03:31:19.630 --> 03:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
right way to go so would they be a great
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
candidate yes and the reason why they're
 
03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
a great candidate obviously they have
 
03:31:25.870 --> 03:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
experience but also if you look at if
 
03:31:27.870 --> 03:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're the the franchisee and you're in
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
the same town or same vicinity as a ATC
 
03:31:33.389 --> 03:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a market
 
03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
competitor all right you would be
 
03:31:37.269 --> 03:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
basically essentially if they were to
 
03:31:40.349 --> 03:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
voluntarily be asked to become a a
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
retail store store they're choosing to
 
03:31:45.070 --> 03:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
go that direction you're essentially
 
03:31:46.590 --> 03:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
you're not limiting your competitor but
 
03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to The Branding identity
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
of what the stores would look like it
 
03:31:51.910 --> 03:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
would protect that brand you didn't want
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
some of your franchises to have these
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
two stores or dual stores inside there
 
03:31:58.269 --> 03:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
and others not again that was the unfair
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
Market uh un unfair Market
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
competition my understanding was that
 
03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
was what the agreement was when I say
 
03:32:07.269 --> 03:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
agreement that was where we all came to
 
03:32:07.279 --> 03:32:07.950 align:start position:0%
agreement that was where we all came to
a

03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:32:10.349 --> 03:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
consensus and that was not something
 
03:32:12.670 --> 03:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
that was opposed at the time by the atcs
 
03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding I thought
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
since it when sounded so sure that I I
 
03:32:18.990 --> 03:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
was wrong I asked other people on the on
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
the members of the commission we seem to
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
all had the same understanding what what
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
that was so things Chang no one's it's
 
03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
not signed in blood that you have to
 
03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
stick to it but that was what the
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
arrangement was uh we came to that and I
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
believe it's m Mr chairman you were the
 
03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
one that said you can only can have one
 
03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
master and the problem you're running
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
into is some when it came to enforcement
 
03:32:41.950 --> 03:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
of some of the the therap the rules that
 
03:32:45.189 --> 03:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
apply to the therapeutic facilities if
 
03:32:46.990 --> 03:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
liquor was in uh The Liquor Commission
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
is now in charge of enforcement they
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
should be involved in the in drafting
 
03:32:55.070 --> 03:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
some of the rules so it kind of became
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
what happens if you have a conflict it
 
03:32:58.590 --> 03:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
kind of the overlap there was really
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
something of a concern uh some language
 
03:33:01.950 --> 03:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
that we came up with after the
 
03:33:04.030 --> 03:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
commission concluded its work was if
 
03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict uh between the
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
rules that you would have uh Liquor's
 
03:33:10.269 --> 03:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
rule would supersede the therapeutic
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
rule just so there's clear understanding
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
of what is in effect U when you're
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with with um the retail stores
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
so that's what the arrangement that we
 
03:33:22.670 --> 03:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
came to was now I understand that
 
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that have a
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
different ideas how they would do this I
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
would do it differently Mr chairman I
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
know you would do it differently if if
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
it was just you we disagreed on a lot of
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
things during that commission hearing
 
03:33:32.399 --> 03:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
things during that commission hearing
But

03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
But
 
03:33:35.309 --> 03:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately we came to a consensus on
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
what we were going to go forward with I
 
03:33:39.429 --> 03:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
will say proceed with caution by
 
03:33:42.429 --> 03:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
changing the number 15 by changing this
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
to agency as opposed to franchise stores
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the whole thing falls
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
apart it doesn't matter which one you
 
03:33:52.309 --> 03:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
think is better I haven't gone through
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
this yet I'm sure there's plenty of in
 
03:33:55.710 --> 03:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
here that I'll I'll like this probably
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
things I would have done differently I'm
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
just suggesting by changing it it does
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
fall apart uh and it's not me that you
 
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
have to convince uh in order to support
 
03:34:07.950 --> 03:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
this so with that being said um I'll
 
03:34:10.030 --> 03:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions if anyone wants to
 
03:34:11.189 --> 03:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
ask me anything about else the
 
03:34:13.830 --> 03:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
commission did I will just say one last
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
one last part of this uh as part of that
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
agreement the therapeutic products when
 
03:34:19.469 --> 03:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
they're sold in the retail stor was also
 
03:34:21.670 --> 03:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to the royalty share
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
so the revenue would have actually been
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
higher estimated about 15 20% market
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
share uh it seemed to make sense that
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
that would uh that would in obviously
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
increase the state revenue but at the
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
same time by having more distribution
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
outlets for that therapeutic products it
 
03:34:39.790 --> 03:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
seemed that there would be an increase
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh in sales as well so it seemed like
 
03:34:44.110 --> 03:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
that was a win-win at least it was but
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
from what I gather from watching the
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
last hearing it doesn't seem like that
 
03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
really isn't the agreement anymore so if
 
03:34:51.630 --> 03:34:51.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have an agreement as far as I'm
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
concerned there's nothing requiring us
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
to mandate that therapeutic stores
 
03:35:00.269 --> 03:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
me great uh representative
 
03:35:08.189 --> 03:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
burrow thank you thank you senator for
 
03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you explain why
 
03:35:12.870 --> 03:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
this would fall apart if we had more
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
than 15 or if we went to the um agency
 
03:35:15.920 --> 03:35:18.429 align:start position:0%
than 15 or if we went to the um agency
store

03:35:18.429 --> 03:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.790 --> 03:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
model so there was a lot of different
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
people and a lot of us I voted against
 
03:35:27.070 --> 03:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
how many Canabis bills as a member of
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
the House Mr chairman you were there
 
03:35:31.349 --> 03:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
representa you were there you listen to
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
those long boring speeches but I've done
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
it several
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
times there's a lot of people on both in
 
03:35:40.030 --> 03:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate that have are
 
03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
willing to come to they will consider
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
certain versions of this the problem is
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the agency side of this now you
 
03:35:48.630 --> 03:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
have this dual license you have this
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
unfair market share the agency stores
 
03:35:52.189 --> 03:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
have different meanings on the different
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
laws especially when you talk about
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
liquor but if it's not a franchise model
 
03:35:59.550 --> 03:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
it's if it's an agency store protecting
 
03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
the brand identity of what the
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
storefront looks like is is going to be
 
03:36:05.189 --> 03:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
different you don't have as much control
 
03:36:08.229 --> 03:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
over an agency agency store as you would
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
a franchise and when that was what the
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
agreement was my understanding that the
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
corner office was also on board with the
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
franchise language I'm not sure how they
 
03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
would how they would react to this
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
agency language but when things are
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
presented cut and dry like that that
 
03:36:27.790 --> 03:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
that changes everything but it would be
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
safe to say we're really not sure
 
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what agency store means because
 
03:36:33.630 --> 03:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
all we can think of is agency liquor
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
stores which I'm clearly sure this bill
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
does not do that so we'll we need to
 
03:36:41.469 --> 03:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
delve what you're pointing out is we
 
03:36:44.070 --> 03:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
need to delve into figuring out what
 
03:36:46.110 --> 03:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
what does that mean if it just means
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
changing the name from franchise to
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
agency then then no harm done if it if
 
03:36:53.710 --> 03:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
there if there's something else in the
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
details then that's what we'll need to
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
learn yeah in in respectfully Mr
 
03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
chairman if there's no harm done and you
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
just changing the name why change it in
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:37:03.790 --> 03:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
place um I I guess people don't like the
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
idea of the word franchise because I
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
guess there's federal law around
 
03:37:10.429 --> 03:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
franchise and and they think we're
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
exposing ourselves to a uh a separate
 
03:37:16.469 --> 03:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
statute that might cause us harm so what
 
03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
what I would I what I would say in
 
03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
respect to the fear of enforcement under
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
federal law we discussed that in the
 
03:37:28.110 --> 03:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
commission we went over the Attorney
 
03:37:29.950 --> 03:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
General's office provid us a lot of
 
03:37:31.830 --> 03:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
instances where the federal government
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
has suggested they would do something
 
03:37:36.750 --> 03:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
all that was presented to us in this
 
03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
franchise model they they felt the risk
 
03:37:42.150 --> 03:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
of the feds coming coming down and just
 
03:37:43.710 --> 03:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
cracking down on just New Hampshire and
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
not any any of the other states was uh
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
reduced by not being a pure State
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
Control model but as opposed to the
 
03:37:53.550 --> 03:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
franchise model but you call it agency
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
or franchise for the purposes of of the
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
federal law I don't think anything
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
changes you're just calling it something
 
03:38:02.349 --> 03:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
different if that's GNA perhaps make
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
people feel better people feel better
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
about it then why not that's I I mean I
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into the semantics
 
03:38:12.189 --> 03:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
until I find out what is actually in
 
03:38:14.110 --> 03:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
this and if if this is about making
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
people feel better at this point this
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
this is not going to work I just I'm
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
just going to say all the fearful of the
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
all the work that went into this we want
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
to just change the name of something
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
because it we like it way it sounds
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
better right doesn't change any the
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
substance I think we're doing our job
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
all right representative spear was
 
03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
next to ask the question Okay
 
03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:39.309 align:start position:0%
next to ask the question Okay
so

03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
represento thank you for taking my
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
question Senator are we here
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
representing the people the residents in
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
the state or are we just here supporting
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
the corner
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
office I'm here I can answer that
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
question for you and I'm here on behalf
 
03:38:57.189 --> 03:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
of District 22 serving the communities
 
03:39:01.150 --> 03:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
of pelum Salem a and plastow uh HB 598
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
from last term I did a lot of the
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
Drafting and to put that into place over
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of objections but a lot of people
 
03:39:10.110 --> 03:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
supported it I'm doing this again being
 
03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
a Bordertown my district from for the
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
most part is surrounded by five
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic uh not therape excuse me
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
retail stores in Massachusetts uh if you
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
drive on the main road from uh ainson
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
into plastow you cut into one street
 
03:39:26.429 --> 03:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
basically into Massachusetts for a
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
quarter of a mile and there's a
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic uh excuse me a retail store
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
right there at that intersection so I'm
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
looking at it as uh a lot of the
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
potential negative uh social uh impacts
 
03:39:39.910 --> 03:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
of a recreational policy whatever those
 
03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
may be we may disagree on what those are
 
03:39:42.990 --> 03:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'm already dealing with those in
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
District 22 that's why I support this
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
however getting this over the Finish
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
Line it requires us all to work together
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
so when we're working together as a
 
03:39:52.950 --> 03:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
commission whether you're one political
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
party or another whether you're a member
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the House the senate or if you're the
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
executive office it's working together
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean we're beholden to one or
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
the other so and if anyone knows me well
 
03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
enough knows that I'm I'm only beholding
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
to my constituents thank you okay
 
03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:09.150 align:start position:0%
to my constituents thank you okay
representative

03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh in reference to what
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
you said earlier Senator regarding um
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
control of the appearance of stores and
 
03:40:21.790 --> 03:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
so forth why do we want to control the
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.189 --> 03:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
stores thank you for the question I
 
03:40:30.269 --> 03:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
think the concept was that if you had a
 
03:40:32.910 --> 03:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
franchise model in your franchise think
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
of any other think of a fast food
 
03:40:37.389 --> 03:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant the logo what that does it
 
03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
cuts down the amount of advertising
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
because you won't we want to limit
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
really the um we're going to limit the
 
03:40:45.550 --> 03:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
types of advertising but also that's the
 
03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
advertising is all going to be done by
 
03:40:49.150 --> 03:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
the state by the by The Liquor
 
03:40:52.110 --> 03:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
Commission so what to me one of the
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
worst parts of the states have gone with
 
03:40:56.830 --> 03:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
a full recreational policy is they have
 
03:40:59.309 --> 03:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
these large bright Billboards all up and
 
03:41:02.830 --> 03:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
down the highways that for these retail
 
03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
stores and that's something personally I
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't support that but by having them
 
03:41:09.630 --> 03:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
all look the same and have the same
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
brand identity it makes the marketing
 
03:41:14.670 --> 03:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
much simpler also that's where the
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
royalty comes into place that's why
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
every McDonald's has the same sign the
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
same symbol and there's some
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what the store can look
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
like also what you can sell there's a
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
reason why McDonald's doesn't sell they
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
don't want you selling hot dogs for
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that's their corporate
 
03:41:30.670 --> 03:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
policy that's how it is uh further
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
question further question thank you uh
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a you know a hearing this is
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
just a
 
03:41:42.670 --> 03:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
yes you can but please don't make it a
 
03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:49.309 align:start position:0%
yes you can but please don't make it a
hearing

03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
um you said that um uh it would make the
 
03:41:59.670 --> 03:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
marketing uh simpler um to control the
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
appearance of the stores but since the
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
most recent version of the bill as I
 
03:42:07.469 --> 03:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
understand it basically forbids
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
advertising um and just about any other
 
03:42:13.750 --> 03:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
form of marketing uh
 
03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
then is that does that argument still
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
apply so the idea is that any marketing
 
03:42:24.269 --> 03:42:24.279 align:start position:0%
towards miners was going to be strictly
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
prohibited to the extent they would be
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
any advertising it would be done and
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state that's part of
 
03:42:32.429 --> 03:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
what their operation would be now we
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
didn't we didn't draft comprehensive
 
03:42:36.990 --> 03:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
rules or anything yet because again we
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
were there was we kept kind of switching
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
directions on which
 
03:42:43.469 --> 03:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
which road we were going to go down with
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
putting together a wreck policy but the
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
advertising side of things we just
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
figured if you did have any type of
 
03:42:53.070 --> 03:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
promotional material that every
 
03:42:55.510 --> 03:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
franchise franchisee would benefit from
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
that promotion and this also where I
 
03:43:02.670 --> 03:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
thought the the market would go is the
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
money side of things is really the
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
individual products think of any liquor
 
03:43:10.349 --> 03:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
you know you name your liquor right they
 
03:43:12.429 --> 03:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
they don't own a storefront it's their
 
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
label on their product that's where this
 
03:43:17.149 --> 03:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
eventually goes our New Hampshire liquor
 
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
stores have all the same sign same type
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
of logos if you see that so it's kind of
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
mimicking the infrastructure we have
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be exactly the same
 
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
but we're following that that route as I
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the latest version of
 
03:43:33.670 --> 03:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
the bill forbids advertising all
 
03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
together not just advertising to miners
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
so again if advertising is forbidden
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
does that AR arguments will apply well I
 
03:43:43.630 --> 03:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure if it's where it says
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
that in and I'm assuming we're looking
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
at the same draft not the amendment that
 
03:43:49.750 --> 03:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
was filed today yeah where where are you
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
referring to but if it says that I I'm
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
not against any form of advertising but
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
again that's something that that's a
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
minor detail that I think we can work
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
out I think where it gets gets more
 
03:44:02.550 --> 03:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
controversial is the types of
 
03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
advertising you're going to do all right
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to interject here
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear you have a
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
question to me no I have a question I'm
 
03:44:15.070 --> 03:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
done with him you talk to me all right
 
03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you yes why did the uh when you
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
handed out the amendment yes I this is
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
didn't representative Le's no not that
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
one the one you handed out okay which is
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
the one we understood came from their
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
originally from the commission correct
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
it had nothing in there about uh ex
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
exonerating people possession like ISS
 
03:44:40.830 --> 03:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I commission intentionally left
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
that out
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
because the uh even with that
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislation marijuana wouldn't be legal
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of have of selling in or
 
03:44:54.030 --> 03:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
legally present would be for another two
 
03:44:57.269 --> 03:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
years anyways so the issue was that the
 
03:45:00.750 --> 03:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
commission was more focused in passing
 
03:45:04.269 --> 03:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
legislation to dealing with the issue of
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
how we're going to sell it how we're
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to allow license Manu you know the
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
cultivators doing all that
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that in the interim before it
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
actually was being sold in that
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
meantime that the Judiciary
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
committees who know much more about
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
legal process would have worked out the
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
inment issue that was the same thing we
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
had in our we had this conversation in
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
this committee a year ago that I said
 
03:45:35.149 --> 03:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
this I don't want to do that nman we
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't know Congress doesn't know
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
anything about nman we don't know how to
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
do that and we can that's okay to let go
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to change
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
anything in the next two years because
 
03:45:50.189 --> 03:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
we won't actually have legal marijuana
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
in the state I I will tell you that
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's been some progress with that so
 
03:45:58.149 --> 03:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
keep mind we're up against a deadline we
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have the summer time to actually
 
03:46:01.389 --> 03:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
meet that the commission wasn't formed
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
to the end of the summer so we didn't we
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything in July and August
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
the language that was in HB 639 that
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
we had to work with that required the
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
court to vacate every single possession
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
conviction period the problem is the
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
court doesn't really have a mechanism to
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
go looking for cases from 1970
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
1960 the the way the analment process
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
works is someone comes in and they apply
 
03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
for it they fill out a piece of paper
 
03:46:29.550 --> 03:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's how they know where to find the
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
file so the language as written was not
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
something that would really work despite
 
03:46:36.870 --> 03:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
how well intended it was but on the last
 
03:46:39.309 --> 03:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
day of the commission and we figured we
 
03:46:40.710 --> 03:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
weren't going to have time to focus on
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
that because it wasn't really the charge
 
03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee but uh the repres the
 
03:46:47.389 --> 03:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
person designated by the ACLU basically
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
clarifi the enement language to mimic
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
what we already have but Chang the
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility to The Possession limits
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
that would be in whatever legislation we
 
03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
passed which is something that I was
 
03:46:58.469 --> 03:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
willing to support but we didn't have
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
time to really uh work that out in the
 
03:47:04.469 --> 03:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
in the commission but in the ACL is here
 
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
they can tell me if I'm I'm wrong but
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding is at least
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
for my sake I was okay with the language
 
03:47:10.910 --> 03:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
that was been proposed I passed that
 
03:47:12.510 --> 03:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
around to the chairman as well so you
 
03:47:16.149 --> 03:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
feel in general that the um if we ever
 
03:47:19.149 --> 03:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
did come to an agreement right that uh
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that there isn't anything in
 
03:47:22.510 --> 03:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
there about the annulment now that
 
03:47:24.149 --> 03:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we won't be able to put
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
something there something in an nment in
 
03:47:29.149 --> 03:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment so that's a non-issue at
 
03:47:31.870 --> 03:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
this point nment if we're taking if
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
we're discussing this amendment which
 
03:47:36.510 --> 03:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
one are you holding up I'm holding up
 
03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
one are you holding up I'm holding up
represent

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:40.990 align:start position:0%
represent
0337

03:47:40.990 --> 03:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
0337
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right and at this point this is the
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
the sponsor bill this is the sponsor's
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment okay at this point this is the
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
only one I'm discussing okay so there is
 
03:47:52.830 --> 03:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
an in there if we don't pass this
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
amendment or we don't work with this one
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
thing get this one baby done we're not
 
03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
going backwards okay we're not going to
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
look at anything else this is this is it
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
good okay not really to the I he is
 
03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
telling us what happened in the Comm
 
03:48:13.870 --> 03:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
okay I also just when I W in so he is
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
telling where we left off where we were
 
03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
when came to December okay I I only read
 
03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
the first two pages of the 30 something
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
pages so I don't want to speak on it
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
without reading yeah so let's just deal
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
with this document okay is he here
 
03:48:32.110 --> 03:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
speaking because he was the commission
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
that was in charge but we're done with
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm sorry I guess she doesn't
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
want to hear anymore from I she she's
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
all done with you thank you very much
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
all right I appreciate the warm
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
welcome I Mr chairman if I can just say
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
one thing um in respect for myself I
 
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support any legislation that
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
mandates that any person entity gets a
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
license that's just me I say it again I
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
would not support any legislation that
 
03:49:03.309 --> 03:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
mandates or that's any one person or
 
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
entity receives a license by operational
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
law license for to become a retail store
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
I every you you want the limited license
 
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a hint okay if you ask
 
03:49:18.670 --> 03:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
me right I I guess U and and represent
 
03:49:21.149 --> 03:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
Lan is here to introduce the bill so I
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
guess I I I have to say where I'm coming
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
from because you posed a what I consider
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
a very awkward question I mean are we
 
03:49:33.389 --> 03:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
here for the governor okay no so in in
 
03:49:33.399 --> 03:49:34.830 align:start position:0%
here for the governor okay no so in in
reality

03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
reality
 
03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
is I am and you know why because I have
 
03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
voted for marijuana bills I have voted
 
03:49:44.950 --> 03:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
for multiple marijuana bills and they
 
03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:46.189 align:start position:0%
for multiple marijuana bills and they
all

03:49:46.189 --> 03:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:49:50.309 --> 03:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
died okay and when one of the reasons
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
they died is because the governor's
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
threat of veto and the governor
 
03:49:56.239 --> 03:49:58.030 align:start position:0%
threat of veto and the governor
says

03:49:58.030 --> 03:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:50:01.590 --> 03:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
hey I would
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
sign if you did something like this I'm
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
gonna pay attention now maybe you don't
 
03:50:09.309 --> 03:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
pay attention maybe you think well he's
 
03:50:11.469 --> 03:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
a Republican and I don't care about him
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay but I I will pay I if it was John
 
03:50:17.149 --> 03:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
Lynch saying the same thing when he beat
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
told marijuana and he said I think I
 
03:50:23.189 --> 03:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
would sign this I would still pay
 
03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
attention I don't care what you say
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
about do I'm doing this for my
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
constituents most of my constituents
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
have no clue and frankly don't really
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
have to care because there's two
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana stores that are are less than
 
03:50:37.950 --> 03:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
five minutes drive away from their homes
 
03:50:40.269 --> 03:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
okay so this it's really not about my
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
constituents it is about yes I believe
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire should have
 
03:50:50.349 --> 03:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
marijuana available okay and I think
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's high time that we pass something
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
and so yes I'm going to pay attention to
 
03:50:59.469 --> 03:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
those guidelines those guard rails as we
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
like to call them that were presented by
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
the governor now if you want to say is
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
no I just want to pass what I want to
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
pass that's at this
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
point have at it guys there's been a lot
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
of work I you know and everybody keeps
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
saying you've worked so hard on this
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
John okay but my opinion doesn't matter
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
okay what matters right now is can we
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
put something
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
together that we can get out of this
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee we can get out of ways and
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
means get it over to the Senate and have
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
something that the Senate I assume will
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
be mucking around with
 
03:51:39.870 --> 03:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
it and then we can can decide when it
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
comes back to us whether we can live
 
03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
not and if we can we'll concur we send
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
it to the governor's desk and I would
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
assume most of us would hope that he
 
03:51:58.189 --> 03:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
won't beo it and that's a lot of lot of
 
03:52:00.870 --> 03:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
bites of the
 
03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:02.510 align:start position:0%
bites of the
Apple

03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
Apple
 
03:52:05.550 --> 03:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
exactly please thank
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
you okay pleas with the noise
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay now we're ready
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
repres I would say um normally I would
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
say let's go through this but I i' ask
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
you could you start by showing us what's
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
in here about the agency so that we all
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
we all are on the same page when we talk
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
about agency versus franchisee so you
 
03:52:32.189 --> 03:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what where in here is
 
03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
the differences between the two so we
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
have an idea John can I ask you one
 
03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
question based on what you just said yes
 
03:52:42.149 --> 03:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
assuming we wanted to be very practical
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to get something through
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of what it is not regardless
 
03:52:48.510 --> 03:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously you could say no I
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't want anything and then that's the
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
end of that yeah
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatever we have plenty of people who
 
03:52:54.990 --> 03:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to vote for any marijuana
 
03:52:59.229 --> 03:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not talking about that
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay if we were to go to a spec because
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
both bills have a very different model
 
03:53:06.870 --> 03:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know that we have we got about
 
03:53:08.590 --> 03:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
to find out we're about to find out what
 
03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
an AG model well some of us have looked
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
at this and you know exactly the
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
difference between no not exactly but I
 
03:53:16.269 --> 03:53:16.279 align:start position:0%
know a little bit we receiv some stuff
 
03:53:16.279 --> 03:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
know a little bit we receiv some stuff
yesterday

03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay somewhat different model
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
okay I can understand that in the future
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
we could change the number of stores we
 
03:53:28.149 --> 03:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
could change what the stores look like
 
03:53:30.429 --> 03:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
we can change anything and everything
 
03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
except that model but the model that we
 
03:53:35.550 --> 03:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
will we would not be ever be able to go
 
03:53:38.349 --> 03:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
back on that no that's actually not
 
03:53:40.830 --> 03:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily true because it would take a
 
03:53:42.910 --> 03:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
while take over a year before anything
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
to be in place you thinking that time
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
frame before it BEC that I I'm pretty
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
sure well unless he's changed the 18
 
03:53:52.469 --> 03:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
month but the first license of of a
 
03:53:54.510 --> 03:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
retailer wouldn't be issued until 18
 
03:53:56.149 --> 03:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
months that's where it was I don't know
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
if it still is so if that's still true
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
that means we have a whole another
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
legislative year to second guess
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves and and change it we would
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
actually have next year to change
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
anything that came to it was retailed
 
03:54:13.590 --> 03:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so actually to me one of the
 
03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
important things why we really want to
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
pass something is that we want to get
 
03:54:20.750 --> 03:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
the cultivators going we want to get
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
those cultivator licenses out there and
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
as far as I heard there is not much
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
debate about cultivator license so the
 
03:54:29.630 --> 03:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
Sooners we get them out there the sooner
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
we'll know we'll have product to sell so
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
stores okay uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
I want to thank senator abbis for all
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
the work that he's done on this I'm
 
03:54:44.149 --> 03:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
sorry that I wasn't able to try and join
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
that commission but it was a very
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
challenging year for my family and I
 
03:54:48.630 --> 03:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
didn't want to commit to something where
 
03:54:49.950 --> 03:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be able to attend the
 
03:54:52.910 --> 03:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
meetings um with that said um I heard a
 
03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
lot of the concerns that he had and I
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to start off by addressing those
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
with how it's in the amendment and then
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
walk through those changes so you can
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what is proposed um
 
03:55:05.590 --> 03:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
so his first question was um around the
 
03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
concern about any retailer being able to
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
sell was about the market Advantage for
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
the atc's if they were able to open up a
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
storefront um within the within the way
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
that we have set up um actually you know
 
03:55:21.389 --> 03:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
what that's gets so deep into how I'm
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
doing it I'm going to pause on that one
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the branding and
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
identity issues um we would be getting
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
doing away with any of that billboard
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
advertising and enacting a fine so that
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
even if out of state uh retailers were
 
03:55:35.429 --> 03:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
advertising in New Hampshire they would
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
not be able to do that so that our kids
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be driving around and asking
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
asking Mom hey Mom what's cannabis
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
because it's on the Billboards so this
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be something where at least inside
 
03:55:47.149 --> 03:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire nobody would
 
03:55:48.910 --> 03:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
see a billboard and there wouldn't be
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
any general purpose advertising it would
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
allow uh listing on weed maps it would
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
allow anything in Publications that are
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
related to cannabis so that anybody
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
who's seeking out cannabis most people
 
03:56:01.630 --> 03:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
know that there are Publications that
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
you can go to they were in large
 
03:56:05.149 --> 03:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
circulation well before it was legal
 
03:56:06.990 --> 03:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country and even if
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
somebody has only passing interest in
 
03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis um there's a lot of knowledge
 
03:56:14.110 --> 03:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
that you can seek out those locations so
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of having a market that grows
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
slowly and doesn't overwhelm with a
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of novice users I think that
 
03:56:22.110 --> 03:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
the idea of not having advertising so
 
03:56:23.349 --> 03:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
that we don't have it in front of our
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
kids so we don't have to worry about how
 
03:56:27.030 --> 03:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
to standardize that between all of the
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
different all the different operations
 
03:56:31.229 --> 03:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh would actually be a big benefit
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
because then it would be a slow uptake
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
of those um existing users or those who
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
simply aren't doing it because it it's
 
03:56:40.189 --> 03:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
not lawful in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:56:41.950 --> 03:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
it's a small population who are those
 
03:56:44.429 --> 03:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
rule followers um but I think let's
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
start small and let's not start with an
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
Outreach of advertising that can always
 
03:56:50.469 --> 03:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
be dealt with in the future once we
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
understand what the market looks like so
 
03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of having consistent branding
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
for Billboards and for marketing going
 
03:56:58.510 --> 03:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
from a franchise free fee is quite moot
 
03:57:01.389 --> 03:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that advertising um and
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
then secondly we actually allow we
 
03:57:06.030 --> 03:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
provide for rules around the finished
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
quality and exerience exteria of the
 
03:57:10.790 --> 03:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
business and signs and Logo within the
 
03:57:13.229 --> 03:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis so that even
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
without having a franchise model those
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
would be in the conditions for opening
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
up a retail outlet so that we can still
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
have that consistency so that uh we
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
don't have buds bud bud barn or anything
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
else that may be offensive to members uh
 
03:57:31.389 --> 03:57:31.399 align:start position:0%
we actually also go um further to say no
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
slaying or promotion which encourages
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
over consumption so the idea of having a
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
sign with the bloodshot eyes and
 
03:57:40.510 --> 03:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
something else that's encouraging over
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
consumption just wouldn't fly under the
 
03:57:45.550 --> 03:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
licensed model we don't need to tell
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
tell somebody how to operate their
 
03:57:50.830 --> 03:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
business um and if we can tell them that
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
they can't use you know crft or vulgar
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
images that are displayed to people
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
outside of their
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
Stores um as far as
 
03:58:04.189 --> 03:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
um as far as the a I I guess I'm going
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
to go back to the whole idea of this
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
trying to represent the commission I
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
have been waiting um since the bill
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
filing deadline for the Senate and then
 
03:58:16.030 --> 03:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
waiting through December and January
 
03:58:18.149 --> 03:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
expecting that a bill was going to be
 
03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
filed from the commission with the
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
commission's um report and with the Comm
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
commission's position even though the
 
03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
official report because people abstained
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
didn't actually adopt a specific
 
03:58:31.630 --> 03:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
language I was under the assumption um
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the chairman um Senator abbis was
 
03:58:36.030 --> 03:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with this so that
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
he would be able to put forward
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
everything that they talked about over
 
03:58:41.149 --> 03:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
the fall all of the hard work and to
 
03:58:42.870 --> 03:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
reflect that with a bill going in
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
through the Senate to be able to address
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
the issues in the Senate and then pass
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
it over to the house to see if it was
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
something um in which we would partake
 
03:58:54.510 --> 03:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:58:57.070 --> 03:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have my bill that I
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
introduced with uh several other
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful co-sponsors we did this
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
because we weren't sure of the outcome
 
03:59:05.950 --> 03:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
of the commission and that's why what
 
03:59:07.790 --> 03:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment here today is trying to
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
bring this Clos to meet all of those
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
goals at the corner office while also
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
avoiding those risks which we do truly
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
believe are real about having too much
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
operational control over the stores so
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the objections um to the
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
what came out of the commission um the
 
03:59:28.710 --> 03:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
biggest part is the high level of
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
control of operations in the rulem
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
authority which was in 318 F6 in that
 
03:59:35.710 --> 03:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that included rules on the
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
size and nature of facilities including
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
store design
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
it included operation of the franchise
 
03:59:44.149 --> 03:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail outlet it included
 
03:59:47.070 --> 03:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
discount and compensation so what
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
discounts you could offer and how much
 
03:59:50.830 --> 03:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
you can pay your employees and the
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
pricing structures for the wholesale
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
price of cannabis and cannabis products
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
that is dictating the operational uh
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
procedures and that is why um I am so
 
04:00:04.630 --> 04:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
concerned that that model would trigger
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
um the number two of the franchise
 
04:00:09.429 --> 04:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
definition to be a franchise you have a
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
trademark you have operational control
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
and then you have those franchise fees
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to have that
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
trademark we're going to have that
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
consistent look of the stores out in
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
front um and we're going to have those
 
04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
fees that are coming through and we're
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
also allowed to have health and safety
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
regulations and normal government
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
regulations of a business without that
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
falling under a franchise it's that
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
operational control that is so dangerous
 
04:00:36.750 --> 04:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
and so that is why we have presented
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
instead of a franchise model uh cannabis
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
retail outlet so um the amendment is not
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
a replace all the amendment left those
 
04:00:48.510 --> 04:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
sections unchanged from the original
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
bill in the original bill which includes
 
04:00:53.469 --> 04:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
the annulment but if you want to turn to
 
04:00:53.479 --> 04:00:56.070 align:start position:0%
the annulment but if you want to turn to
318

04:00:56.070 --> 04:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
318
 
04:00:58.469 --> 04:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
F12 and I'll tell you what page it is as
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
soon as I find
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
that sorry I got this um at 12:15 from
 
04:01:06.269 --> 04:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
OS when I wasn't sure if I should send
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
out my rough draft uh for printing
 
04:01:11.950 --> 04:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
so that is um
 
04:01:14.189 --> 04:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
318f let's see it's in the definition
 
04:01:16.030 --> 04:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry this one is the definitions
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
my apologies I was putting this together
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
with the information so it's right on
 
04:01:21.309 --> 04:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
page three of the amendment starting at
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
line 27 it says the Cannabis retail
 
04:01:26.189 --> 04:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
outlet or Outlet means an entity liks to
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis from Cannabis
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities to purchase from
 
04:01:32.189 --> 04:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and limited Prof
 
04:01:33.870 --> 04:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and to sell transfer and
 
04:01:35.469 --> 04:01:35.479 align:start position:0%
deliver cannabis and cannabis products
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
to Consumers qualifying patients and
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
designated caregivers So within that
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
that is how we are defining it as that
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
retail outlet and then there are
 
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
extensive rules on the op operation of
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
those retailers that are within the
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
regulation section
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
so so when you look to those that is
 
04:01:59.950 --> 04:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
where we have the regulation that has um
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
that has these
 
04:02:04.870 --> 04:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines on how they would present
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
themselves to the public so um if that's
 
04:02:10.469 --> 04:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
enough of just that general idea let me
 
04:02:13.110 --> 04:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
give you the walk through with my
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
changes and the amendment I know it's a
 
04:02:17.950 --> 04:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
lot I know I got it to you late I had
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
circulated some just with a couple few
 
04:02:22.110 --> 04:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
people just for some proof reading and
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
we found numbering issues and
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
duplication so I thank everybody who
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
helped me with that so that I could
 
04:02:29.910 --> 04:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
deliver the best possible product to you
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
today and so that we're focusing on the
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
issues and not on any of my errors in
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
drafting so we changed the purpose and
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
findings which are are now um very
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
reflective of what was in chairman
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hunt's Amendment um that's section one
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the amendment two and three just deal
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
with new references that are throughout
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
and we also adopted the name substance
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
use prevention treatment and Recovery
 
04:02:55.389 --> 04:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
Fund as chairman hunt did um that's
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
throughout that's part of section
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
three um we had deleted the change to
 
04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
the drug forfeiture fund because the the
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Baseline data is being collected
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so that's an unnecessary
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
reference then in um
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
section section five which is the top of
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
Page Three we added harvesting and
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
cultivating to those things which are
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
not illegal because they're permitted by
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
state law that's consistent with the
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
hunt Amendment um and I believe the
 
04:03:25.630 --> 04:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
commission work so that's definitely one
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
of the well done there so then we get to
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
the definitions um the hunt Amendment
 
04:03:32.910 --> 04:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
had removed V vaporizing from Cannabis
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
accessories um I believe that's because
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's an assumption that we're talking
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
about either little cartridges or the
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
things that look like crayon that we
 
04:03:41.790 --> 04:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that they're being
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
regulated appropriately um I don't
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
believe that includes any of the larger
 
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
almost desktop siiz things where
 
04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's doing that in order to avoid
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
impurities especially if they're
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned concerned about
 
04:03:57.910 --> 04:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
their lungs um so um those those larger
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
things I I believe would be fully
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
allowed under the language for inhaling
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis into the human body and if
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
there's disagreement about allowing
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
those larger desktop vaporization
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
devices then we'll need to add that
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
language back in um so we have the
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
Cannabis retail outlet there's a there
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
was a request during the commission and
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
also in Hunts amendment to add a
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis distributor so that's added
 
04:04:21.790 --> 04:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
here but it specifies that it's not an
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
individual Standalone license where only
 
04:04:26.110 --> 04:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
the distributor is allowed to distribute
 
04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
if you're otherwise licensed you can do
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
that as part of your licensed activities
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
but it allows so that if somebody wants
 
04:04:34.750 --> 04:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
distribution distribution only
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise that would be licensed and
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
permitted um it also has in in order to
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
provide as many Market opportunities for
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs as possible it adds a
 
04:04:51.630 --> 04:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
limited production man limited product
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility so the biggest
 
04:04:56.110 --> 04:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
danger in the manufacturing is when
 
04:04:58.269 --> 04:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
you're doing extractions with volatile
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
compounds I did a tour of one of uh one
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the facilities in a neighboring state
 
04:05:06.269 --> 04:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
and oh my that is a science project
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
making sure that it won't explode when
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
you're using volatile gases to do it
 
04:05:12.510 --> 04:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
let's leave that to the people willing
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
to take that risk but allow small
 
04:05:17.550 --> 04:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
markets to develop things with the
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
extracts that they have so that Betty's
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
brownies or anything else that would
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise be allowed could be a business
 
04:05:26.149 --> 04:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
for somebody to open up and for that
 
04:05:28.269 --> 04:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
reason those limited manufacturing would
 
04:05:30.990 --> 04:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
have a $100 non-refund fundable
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
application fee we've set an an applica
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
non-refundable application fee schedule
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
but have left the rest of the fees to Ru
 
04:05:40.030 --> 04:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
making because let's at least get that
 
04:05:41.790 --> 04:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
first line in the sand for where people
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
start I know on Jael car the idea of the
 
04:05:46.349 --> 04:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
non-refundable application fees has been
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
a big topic so let's take care of that
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
here if we can um ads designated
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
caregiver just as chairman Hunt's
 
04:05:55.870 --> 04:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment did um and we remove
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
everything on hom grow for therapeutic
 
04:05:59.950 --> 04:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis there's already a separate bill
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
on that let's not confuse the issue by
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
including that here let's that let that
 
04:06:06.510 --> 04:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
live on its own um it also adds the
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
definition and premises from the
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the therapeutic grade
 
04:06:13.389 --> 04:06:13.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis product um so with that there's
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
we also have a provision for rulle
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
making that would happen sorry that um
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
we would have a provision for the Liquor
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
Commission the Department of Health and
 
04:06:23.070 --> 04:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
Human Services therapeutic cannabis
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
program to work together to suggest
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
legislation to either transfer the TCP
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
into the liquor department partially or
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
wholly and then figure out what laws
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
would be required if uh therapeutic
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis were to be offered in other
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
retail stores
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that that would be a huge
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
benefit to everybody so that that
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis could be purchased
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
and sold in those stores but because
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
there are certain purchasing limits
 
04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
there's only a certain amount you can
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
buy within 10 days within the
 
04:06:55.309 --> 04:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program that is
 
04:06:57.309 --> 04:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
highly complex to roll out to all of
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
these different retail outlets so that
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
would be something to wait and get that
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
input from The Liquor Commission and the
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
TCP to figure out how to legislatively
 
04:07:09.790 --> 04:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
enact that before these stores are going
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
into into force and quite honestly that
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
seems like a great place for the
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
Distributors so I'm seeing some of these
 
04:07:19.950 --> 04:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
great Market niches here um let see then
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
the enforcement Authority we had only
 
04:07:24.109 --> 04:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
had one sim paragraph sub paragraph in
 
04:07:25.710 --> 04:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
there we added just about everything
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
from chairman Hunt's Amendment though we
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
did not allow them to interpret statutes
 
04:07:33.149 --> 04:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
and rules um generally there's a certain
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
amount that's allowed within normal
 
04:07:36.269 --> 04:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
practice but we don't want to supersede
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary branch and we don't want
 
04:07:41.229 --> 04:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
to overstate the roles of the commission
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
so that language was problematic so that
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
was removed here um and as was the Rules
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
of Evidence you know we we could be
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
looking at from pretty serious impacts
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
on people um through the enforcement and
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of not having the Rules of
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
Evidence um seems problematic to me you
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
know if that needs to be a later
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
discussion it can be a discussion but I
 
04:08:03.870 --> 04:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
REM that was removed because I find that
 
04:08:03.880 --> 04:08:04.830 align:start position:0%
REM that was removed because I find that
quite

04:08:04.830 --> 04:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
quite
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
troubling and then we have the Cannabis
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
um that combines the members of both um
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
the initial 1633 and the hunt Amendment
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
which creates a very large very very
 
04:08:18.830 --> 04:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
large Advisory Board and we need to make
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
sure that it'll be functional so there's
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
a few things that U reviewing different
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
advisory boards within my committee
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I've noted are
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
starting to be suggested to make them
 
04:08:30.990 --> 04:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
work better one is that when somebody's
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
term has expired until somebody else is
 
04:08:36.429 --> 04:08:36.439 align:start position:0%
is in that position they can still
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
attend the question then would be
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're considered part
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
of Quorum you know that's one of those
 
04:08:42.429 --> 04:08:42.439 align:start position:0%
issues that can be dealt with and be
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
figured out but I think that allowing
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
them in unless they are removed for
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
misconduct or for um absenteeism I think
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to the function of
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
the ad of The Advisory Board there's
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
also the issue of making sure that that
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
that people actually show up once
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
they're on a commission I'm on some
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
commissions where sometimes they're not
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
able to meet because either they don't
 
04:09:07.269 --> 04:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
have enough people named or they don't
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
have people showing up so there's not a
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
quorum just for a regular meeting so it
 
04:09:13.469 --> 04:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
defined Quorum as a majority of those
 
04:09:15.870 --> 04:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
who've been appointed not a majority of
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
those that that exist as potential seats
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
to be filled and it also only requires a
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
quorum for voting so that the whole the
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
whole Advisory board or any
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees which are specifically
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
enabled within this are able to do some
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
good work and that's quite important
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
because one of the areas we charge The
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
Advisory board with is looking at new
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence so that that can be
 
04:09:40.349 --> 04:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
incorporated that's a great thing for a
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we don't really need 50
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
million people together discussing that
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
evidence so let's figure out how to make
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
this functional and
 
04:09:51.070 --> 04:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial so it also add some charges
 
04:09:53.469 --> 04:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
um and Inc increase in Outlets or canopy
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
limits uh advising on the potential need
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
for a state Reference Laboratory or
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
collaborating with other states
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
reference Laboratories if that's
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
possible and um it removes the
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
advertising oversight because we're not
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
going to have advertising so it's
 
04:10:08.670 --> 04:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but it adds the ability to
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
advise on packaging and signage so now
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
we get to the regulation of cannabis
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh 318 F9 in this bill
 
04:10:20.149 --> 04:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you what page that
 
04:10:20.159 --> 04:10:21.229 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you what page that
starts

04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
starts
 
04:10:25.469 --> 04:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
on 11 11 thank you very much ah yes
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
right there in the middle I wish there
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
were spaces between those uh those
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
chapters so this uh has a timeline
 
04:10:33.550 --> 04:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
between the original and that which is
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the hunt Amendment um there would be
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
rules for dual use within 16 months
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
months so that we would know how a dual
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
use would be able to function and then
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
they can apply to get that dual use
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
certificate there's rules for
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
cultivation within 18 months so that we
 
04:10:50.349 --> 04:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
can have cultivation sooner and then
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
rules for licensing and regulation of
 
04:10:54.510 --> 04:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis establishments within 20
 
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
months so that makes it so that
 
04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's ready to come out of the
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
Starting Gate to apply for those retail
 
04:11:04.429 --> 04:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
outlets um after that you know within 20
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
within 22 months the there's also a me
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism for selection if there's more
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
than 15 applications for Outlets because
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
we left it at the cap of 15 um we did
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
say that if there three atc's the three
 
04:11:21.229 --> 04:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
operating atc's um have a license that
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
an application that would be accepted
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
that they do get those they did break
 
04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
the ground here we don't want to give
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
them an unfair Advantage but we also
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to kneecap them and make them
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
have to create a whole new separate
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
store you know we need to respect the
 
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
work that was done while making sure
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
that we're not giving any unfair
 
04:11:38.670 --> 04:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
advantages and there's quite a few areas
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
in here that we look to make sure that
 
04:11:42.510 --> 04:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them an extra jump on
 
04:11:42.520 --> 04:11:44.469 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them an extra jump on
anything

04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
either so we added the disqualifying
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
conditions for lure from the hunt
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment um let's see there's rules to
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
assess the need for more stores at least
 
04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
each year Geographic restrictions of one
 
04:11:58.830 --> 04:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
per municipality or one for every 15,000
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
in population in the municipality and
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
1,000 ft from schools it still follows
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal zoning laws um within
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
cultivation rules it would um have them
 
04:12:12.030 --> 04:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
develop a canopy cap if that's necessary
 
04:12:15.790 --> 04:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
and um both the outlets and cultivators
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
would need to either open or make
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
significant progress and show why they
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
haven't yet opened within a certain time
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
period for their license to remain in
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
effect um that's to prevent anybody from
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
getting a license and sitting on it you
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
know this is going to be a really really
 
04:12:33.149 --> 04:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
small Market with only 10 licenses um
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's one of those areas where we need to
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that if somebody has a license
 
04:12:38.590 --> 04:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
they're actually moving forward and
 
04:12:40.990 --> 04:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
making progress yet giving Grace
 
04:12:42.269 --> 04:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that sometimes the
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
unforeseen happens obviously we would
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
have accept expected a delay if Co hit
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
in the middle of this
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
implementation so there's distribution
 
04:12:53.710 --> 04:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
rules according like the hunt Amendment
 
04:12:56.189 --> 04:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
removes the event in special use there's
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Advertising like logo
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
signage and marketing no General social
 
04:13:03.309 --> 04:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
media marketing um as in the hunt
 
04:13:05.109 --> 04:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment no slang or promotion which
 
04:13:06.870 --> 04:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
encourages overc consumption which is
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
one of our additions in order to try and
 
04:13:10.990 --> 04:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
quell those fears about what any
 
04:13:13.389 --> 04:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
marketing may have there's a naming
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
convention where it would be a New
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retail cannabis Outlet or New
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Outlet it also could
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
be the dairy cannabis Outlet since
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of people in Dairy supported
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
legalization on a recent ballot measure
 
04:13:28.510 --> 04:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
and uh would allow that if the Liquor
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
Commission approves you could have a
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
name where it would say uh John's craft
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis a New Hampshire cannabis Outlet
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
so that there could can be some
 
04:13:40.030 --> 04:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
differentiation so that you know which
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
one that you're going to but not so much
 
04:13:44.590 --> 04:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
that it creates confusion you know when
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
I go to a liquor store I didn't know
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
until I spoke more to uh some of the
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
representatives here that the one in
 
04:13:53.229 --> 04:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
londondary has an amazing high-end
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
selection and the one that we've secured
 
04:13:56.910 --> 04:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
in Dairy we need to show that we have
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
those tastes before we have that liquor
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
selection similarly in stores in
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
Nordstrom I had to figure out which one
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
sells clothes like this and which one
 
04:14:07.149 --> 04:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
has more of the urban wear and which is
 
04:14:09.630 --> 04:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
more the soccer mom when it has the same
 
04:14:11.469 --> 04:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
name it's kind of hard to know which
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
store to go to to meet your needs it can
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
still be within the same umbrella and
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
and Clarity but if instead of saying oh
 
04:14:21.870 --> 04:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
you should go to the cannabis store and
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
upping because that has a wider variety
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
of gummies and I know you like gummies
 
04:14:32.349 --> 04:14:32.359 align:start position:0%
you can say oh let's go to I don't even
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
know what a name would be that would be
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate with gummies with that but
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
basically if it was you know if it was
 
04:14:39.870 --> 04:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
Sally's kitchen um a New Hampshire
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis Outlet if that would be
 
04:14:43.710 --> 04:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
acceptable to anybody then at least you
 
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
differentiation and I see you probably
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't like Sally's kitchen and I'm okay
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
with that but some differentiation
 
04:14:52.590 --> 04:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
because without the advertising you want
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
to have at least some Nuance to those
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
names um we have the we we decreased the
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
milligram content for Edibles and
 
04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
drinkables to 5 milligrams and we added
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
100 milligram per package which is an
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
industry standard um there are are some
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
areas with 200 milligrams per uh per
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
packaging but let's stick with the
 
04:15:14.189 --> 04:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
industry standard of
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
100 um let's see the packaging and
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
laboring rules from the hunt Amendment
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
so there's a Prohibition on poly drugs
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was already in there but that
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
specifically adds alcohol so that you're
 
04:15:27.149 --> 04:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
not adding it to alcohol or anything
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
else to make it more
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
intoxicating um there's uh potency
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
limits are are would be done through
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
rules with advice through the from The
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and public comment
 
04:15:40.630 --> 04:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
remediation for testing regularities Min
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
minimum testing requirements and that's
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
important because if you have different
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
moisture content when you're testing
 
04:15:47.710 --> 04:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
apparently you can have a different
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
level of THC in that test so if we know
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
what our standards are for testing in
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and each of those testing
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
Labs knows that you need to test at
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the parameters are to have have
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
similar and equivalent tests then we can
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
those can be set through rules um
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
there's also rules on changes in
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
ownership to prevent flipping but
 
04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps that should be a little bit
 
04:16:13.229 --> 04:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
tighter if we only have 15 licenses if
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
we're not sure it's going to expand then
 
04:16:16.750 --> 04:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to go to the Chick-fil-A
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
model on that where if you change
 
04:16:20.910 --> 04:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
ownership it reverts back I mean maybe
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
you can collapse and have somebody leave
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
and have somebody remain with more
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
partnership I don't know we can run into
 
04:16:29.109 --> 04:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
problems when we only have 15 but I know
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
that that's what that's what the
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
governor's looking for so we'll just try
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to work with that the
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
best we can um it also includes INX
 
04:16:39.030 --> 04:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
ating hemp to be regulated in a way not
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
less restrictive than cannabis and as I
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
said before the Liquor Commission and
 
04:16:44.670 --> 04:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program would work
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
to help draft legislation to transfer
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
all our part to the commission and
 
04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
integrate the offer the therapeutic
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis offerings and non-c operated um
 
04:17:01.030 --> 04:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
Outlets um so then in 318 F10 that is
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
where we have the advertising Li
 
04:17:04.510 --> 04:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on Advertising cannabis
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
sales that needs to be in more than just
 
04:17:09.630 --> 04:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
rules because the rules only apply to uh
 
04:17:12.750 --> 04:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
licensed operators and outof state
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis operations are not licensed in
 
04:17:17.309 --> 04:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so by having a Prohibition
 
04:17:20.109 --> 04:17:20.119 align:start position:0%
on those advertisements um then and with
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
those fines that would allow it to have
 
04:17:24.710 --> 04:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
an EV equal playing Ground playing field
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have out of state
 
04:17:28.750 --> 04:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
interest uh buying up billb barns when
 
04:17:28.760 --> 04:17:30.710 align:start position:0%
interest uh buying up billb barns when
instate

04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
instate
 
04:17:33.149 --> 04:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
cannot so and then it has a dual use
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
certificate pathway that is based that
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
should be faster just because we need to
 
04:17:38.830 --> 04:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that we know what they need to
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
do they're already in the business let's
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
figure out that dual use and then let
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
them let them enter into that whole
 
04:17:47.109 --> 04:17:47.119 align:start position:0%
process for the retail stores in the
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
same time as everybody else um licensing
 
04:17:52.349 --> 04:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
procedures to accept and process
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
applications no longer than two months
 
04:17:57.149 --> 04:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
after rules are issued but extend the 90
 
04:17:59.710 --> 04:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
days to issue the license to 120 days
 
04:18:01.149 --> 04:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
because there likely will be more than
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
15 um applicants and we want to make
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
sure that there's some time for them to
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
really assess and make any comparisons
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
necessary or to run a lottery and know
 
04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
how they're going to be able to allocate
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
these you know we haven't prescribed
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
exactly how they will deal with an
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
excess of applicants um but it's quite
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
possible that they will need to deal
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
with that um also in the hunt Amendment
 
04:18:26.429 --> 04:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
the municipal votes uh were on all
 
04:18:28.030 --> 04:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis establishments and it didn't
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
state that it needed to be on the ballot
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
November of
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
2024 um I know in my town I'm sure that
 
04:18:35.070 --> 04:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
they'd put it on the ballot regardless
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
of how the individuals who would be
 
04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
doing that feel because they know that
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
the people of dairy want legalization
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
but if it doesn't say which which
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
election it needs to be in if you have
 
04:18:47.189 --> 04:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
the people who are in charge of setting
 
04:18:49.710 --> 04:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
up that ballot who are against it they
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
may not actually put it on the ballot
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
that first year and it may be delayed
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
and so for consistency sake it should be
 
04:18:59.149 --> 04:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
on the ballot everywhere November 2024
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
and allow for a petition in the future
 
04:19:02.429 --> 04:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
if it
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
fails um residency it adds that the
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
establishments must register with the
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
secretary of state with a principal
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
place of business in New Hampshire just
 
04:19:12.510 --> 04:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
to keep New Hampshire cannabis New
 
04:19:14.670 --> 04:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information materials and
 
04:19:16.590 --> 04:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
medical lock boxes we're adding the
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
standard symbol for products from the
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
hunt Amendment and also adding the
 
04:19:23.109 --> 04:19:23.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for medical lock boxes to be
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
honest when I first read that it scared
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
me because I thought we were talking
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
about something really complex like I've
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
seen with medication coming out at a
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
really expensive crazy machine or a safe
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
I Googled medical lockbox and it looks
 
04:19:38.070 --> 04:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
like the little cash boxes you see at
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
Staples that you have at yard sales or
 
04:19:43.469 --> 04:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
at girl Scott cookie bries if that is
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
what we intend as a medical lock boox
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
something that keeps out a curious kid
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
then I see no problem with stocking that
 
04:19:52.349 --> 04:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
in the stores and you know what a great
 
04:19:53.950 --> 04:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
way for somebody to carry their products
 
04:19:53.960 --> 04:19:55.389 align:start position:0%
way for somebody to carry their products
home

04:19:55.389 --> 04:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
right um and then we also have the
 
04:20:01.070 --> 04:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
lawful operation um it just flows
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
through adds the new entities and it
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
adds a equal starting gun for Outlets
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
once there's Supply to open there's
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
definitely been concern about the idea
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
of not opening any Outlets until the
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
liquor Liquor Commission certifies that
 
04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's sufficient Supply to operate but
 
04:20:17.950 --> 04:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that that's in there
 
04:20:20.910 --> 04:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
is to because one we know that they're
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
not going to be doing anything to
 
04:20:23.870 --> 04:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
handicap this Market opening when it's
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
ready to go you know they're they're not
 
04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
going to sit on it and they're not just
 
04:20:29.349 --> 04:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to wait and delay on it I have far
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
more faith in them than think that they
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
would do that but number two that means
 
04:20:37.109 --> 04:20:37.119 align:start position:0%
that the atc's um that in this bill do
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
get one of three of the 15 licenses
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
assuming that they meet all of the
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
qualifications and filing deadlines that
 
04:20:46.349 --> 04:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
um they are not starting any earlier
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
than anybody else so that's one of those
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
areas where we're bringing it back to
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's fully
 
04:20:54.189 --> 04:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
fair and then proof of ID it adds the
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
requirements on licenses you had as your
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity verifying
 
04:21:01.630 --> 04:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
non-compliance um we did change do a
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
change in the oplc language to
 
04:21:05.550 --> 04:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
misconduct instead of malpractice I
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
talked to um
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
to I talked to director Lindsay about
 
04:21:11.149 --> 04:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
that and uh or director Courtney about
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
that and um and she preferred the word
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
misconduct instead of
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
malpractice um data collection I've I've
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
just found out we probably could do a
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
better job of uh of specifying what's
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
necessary and who is responsible for
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
that so um if if you'd like I can try
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
and come back later with a little bit
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
more on that but that'll just be a
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
Nuance as we move forward and then it
 
04:21:35.189 --> 04:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
moves to an agency fee instead of the
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
rooms meal and cannabis so we're looking
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
we put in 10% I know that the commission
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
was talking about 15% but this also is
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
the policy committee not the finance
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
commit the financial committee so if we
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
move over with an agency fee to Ways and
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
Means then they can figure out if 10 or
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
15 is the right number over there um so
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
I think I think that I would just take
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've moved to an agency
 
04:22:01.229 --> 04:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
fee which is structured very similar to
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
that franchise fee and hopefully
 
04:22:04.590 --> 04:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can take that as a win
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
even if the actual number filled in is
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
different since that is more the domain
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
of ways and means than Commerce uh
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
finally in the control Drug Act
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
definitions um we link it to the
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana definition in the new uh
 
04:22:21.429 --> 04:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis and we remove
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
the deadline to act for conversion from
 
04:22:26.670 --> 04:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit so I know that was a lot to go
 
04:22:30.149 --> 04:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
through um and I apologize that it came
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
to you just today but this was the
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
fastest we could do it this was a pretty
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
substantial rewrite in six days and I'm
 
04:22:39.550 --> 04:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
happy that we were able to get this to
 
04:22:42.189 --> 04:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
you in the form that it's in and um I
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be I guess the other one other
 
04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
thing I gave you another piece of paper
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
that has the current DUI laws um as far
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
as cannabis DUIs people are already
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
getting arrested and already serving the
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
consequences of a cannabis DUI you do
 
04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
not need to test to a certain limit in
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
order to have a DUI and the consequences
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
are significant including never being
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
able to go to Japan having to apply to
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
get into Canada and not being able to go
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
to Mexico for 10 years if you have a DUI
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
so it's even more than just what the
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
state puts on top of us um so with that
 
04:23:16.269 --> 04:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
questions okay um first of all for the
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety in their section so
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
you will work with them to get that
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
paragraphed out yes I'd love to get
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
language from them that would work so
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we can do that they probably want
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
to may want to may want to address a
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
couple of those challenges as well so
 
04:23:37.389 --> 04:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
you want to do do you are willing to
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
write something for her to correct it or
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
are you expecting her to give you
 
04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
something uh I wasn't expecting to write
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
anything but I can provide ches
 
04:23:47.880 --> 04:23:50.389 align:start position:0%
anything but I can provide ches
we

04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
Bas okay now are you in the department
 
04:23:57.389 --> 04:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
of safety is that where you're under yes
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay right well the other guy looked
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.439 --> 04:24:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
know

04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay so I'm just going to assume
 
04:24:09.990 --> 04:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that paragraph We have get an
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
amendment for when obviously meet again
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
next week so we need to have that
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
straightened out for next week okay all
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
right any other comments or questions
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
people might have
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you commissioner hunt um
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question one
 
04:24:31.990 --> 04:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
thing I'm a little confused about is uh
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
you in in one line I see uh if the
 
04:24:36.630 --> 04:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner approves your license and
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
then another place I seek the
 
04:24:41.950 --> 04:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
commission who is actually going to
 
04:24:44.670 --> 04:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
approve somebody's license and what what
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
sort of criteria is there any like
 
04:24:50.030 --> 04:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
Financial bonding or something that
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
somebody needs and I I guess I'm a
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
little concerned that there might be uh
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit of favoritism one way or
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
another if if a single person is making
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh approving somebody's license and
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
disapproving somebody else's if you can
 
04:25:05.790 --> 04:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
explain that process um thank you that's
 
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
actually a great Point that's one of the
 
04:25:09.870 --> 04:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
areas that was going to largely be left
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
with to rule making but anything that
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
you would want to set in as guard rails
 
04:25:16.710 --> 04:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
I think especially if there's some
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the language if you can
 
04:25:21.149 --> 04:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
follow up with me to just help me find
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
those I'm I'm going a little bit
 
04:25:24.109 --> 04:25:24.119 align:start position:0%
crossided from reading through this
 
04:25:25.870 --> 04:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
probably a hundred times over the last
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
six days if not more um and I apologize
 
04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
for missing that but I would love to
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
standardize that language to make sure
 
04:25:34.030 --> 04:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
that it works I do know that in some of
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
the things in the Department of Health
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's um the commissioner or a design um
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
but we'd need to figure out what would
 
04:25:44.349 --> 04:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate section there and the
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate person to approve it but I
 
04:25:48.189 --> 04:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
do recognize we have an amazing
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner right now but um just like
 
04:25:51.790 --> 04:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
I say with other departments just
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
because the person here is amazing and
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that the next election
 
04:25:56.590 --> 04:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
will be as great so let's make sure we
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
legislate for to Future proof it and not
 
04:26:01.149 --> 04:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
just rely on how amazing our current
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
people are thank you represent
 
04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
bullo thank you for taking my question
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
the um the amount of stores that would
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
be licensed initially 15 is there
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
provision where you know within a a year
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
or two there could be 20 or 25 or is
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
there a limit of 15 and that's
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
it um thank you so in the um so in the
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
The Hunt amendment that had come out it
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
had said 15 for five years and then
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
reassessing every five years in this one
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
it says 15 for for 30 months to consider
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
to see how many are necessary and to
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
review it every year um and that's the
 
04:26:43.950 --> 04:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
commission reviewing that just so that
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
they can be more adaptive to the market
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to tie their
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
hands so that if suddenly we noticed
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
because there's areas of the state that
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't actually have Supply through these
 
04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
retail outlets and if we find that
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's more of an illicit Market in
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
those regions it may actually make sense
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
to increase that because that would be a
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
public safety issue um but it also
 
04:27:04.870 --> 04:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't require them to increase that
 
04:27:06.750 --> 04:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
number either
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm trying I'm trying to split
 
04:27:08.159 --> 04:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm trying I'm trying to split
the

04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
baby cut that baby in half okay anybody
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
else seem to be losing people here okay
 
04:27:21.790 --> 04:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
great thank you okay thank you all right
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh this uh chairman do you want to have
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
any First Impressions or you have want
 
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
to say anything what you've seen or
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
heard so
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
far okay anybody else would like to uh
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
comment on what we you've heard or seen
 
04:27:36.720 --> 04:27:41.349 align:start position:0%
comment on what we you've heard or seen
so

04:27:41.349 --> 04:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.710 --> 04:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
that I
 
04:27:58.030 --> 04:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
wish uh Mr chairman members of the
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
to make one point um and that is um you
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
know I view this as I'm really uh
 
04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
entirely in accord with chairman hunt on
 
04:28:12.670 --> 04:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
this you know I see that we have
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
basically um you know three um uh
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
Solutions uh bills formats whatever one
 
04:28:24.670 --> 04:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
is the franchise model um that was uh
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know basically um promulgated and um
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
and suggested by the commission and uh
 
04:28:36.429 --> 04:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
and uh leadership and so on um which um
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
is uh the franchise model we have the uh
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
we have 1633 that was originally
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
submitted um you know to this committee
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and then we have um representative uh
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
L's Amendment um basically I think it's
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
really quite simple um we have uh two
 
04:28:56.670 --> 04:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
bills that are essentially non-starters
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
and one bill which is a starter um you
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
know and by that I mean it is a it is a
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
decent foundational beginning um and
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's something I think that can pass and
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
when I say that um I mean that the
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
franchise bill is a nonstarter because
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's legally nonviable as it's written I
 
04:29:18.990 --> 04:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out some of that the the last
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
time I had an opportunity to speak we
 
04:29:21.550 --> 04:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
don't need to go there and I'm not going
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
to go there again I'm just say I'm just
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
referencing that and the um the um
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
franchise model um and the um and 1633
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
is politically unviable and so it's a
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
non-starter so really my point is that I
 
04:29:38.590 --> 04:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
think that by simply changing the
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
language from franchisee to either
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis outlet store or licensed agent
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
or something like that that we avoid all
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the liabilities and issues and risks
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
that I had pointed out the last time um
 
04:29:53.469 --> 04:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
and I think that that would be a a path
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
forward to to laying a foundation for
 
04:29:59.309 --> 04:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
legalization so how's that three minutes
 
04:30:03.389 --> 04:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
right great thank you yes sir okay
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions no okay thank we're not having
 
04:30:06.560 --> 04:30:10.389 align:start position:0%
questions no okay thank we're not having
a

04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you I'll be I'll be brief
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Daryl e I'm the the
 
04:30:16.670 --> 04:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
founder of the New Hampshire cannabis
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
Association um we did submit one very
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
short thing today it's about a three
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
minute read if you want to understand
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about not in terms of
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
State Stores or franchises it's really
 
04:30:28.990 --> 04:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
concepts of of risk and plant touching
 
04:30:30.750 --> 04:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis entities versus cannabis
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
related businesses versus other and this
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
will go through that very quickly so you
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
can got to kind of get a concept of
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
where this model fits within the risk
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
profiles of about the four different
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
licensing schemes that we've been
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking about and then at the bottom is
 
04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
just a very short bullet point list on
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
how this threads the needle to meet the
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
governor's criteria and so I think the
 
04:30:54.510 --> 04:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
melding of these two concepts uh was was
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of hard work but I think it has
 
04:30:58.469 --> 04:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
been accomplished here so just recommend
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind two to three minute
 
04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
read give that a look and if you have
 
04:31:03.550 --> 04:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
any questions by all means reach out
 
04:31:03.560 --> 04:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
any questions by all means reach out
thank

04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:06.429 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:31:06.439 --> 04:31:07.830 align:start position:0%
you
thank

04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:31:10.750 --> 04:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
seeds go on
 
04:31:13.399 --> 04:31:16.590 align:start position:0%
seeds go on
up

04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.830 --> 04:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
us Advisory Board of uh New Hampshire
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association and darl E just
 
04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned comparison that we put
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
together and I I would just like to take
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
a moment to compare how this amended
 
04:31:47.070 --> 04:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
1633 uh meets the criteria that was the
 
04:31:49.630 --> 04:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
charge for the commission because it had
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and it the commission uh
 
04:31:56.429 --> 04:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
shall study the feasibility of
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
establishing a state controlled system
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
to sell marijuana to adults 21 years or
 
04:32:04.830 --> 04:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
older that allows the state to control
 
04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
the distribution and access well this
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill as amended does put the state in
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
control of Licensing regulation
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
distribution and access so it meets that
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
criteria keeps marijuana away from kids
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
and out of schools and the bill contains
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
numerous Provisions to prevent persons
 
04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
under 21 from purchasing cannabis and uh
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
pre prohibits cannabis establishments
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
from being located near schools so it
 
04:32:33.309 --> 04:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
meets that controls the marketing and
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
messaging this bill has numerous
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions and even some prohibitions
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
on the marketing and advertising of
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products prohibits
 
04:32:45.870 --> 04:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana miles or
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
oversaturation this bill puts a limit as
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard of 15 on the number
 
04:32:54.269 --> 04:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide of retail stores and uh giving
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and municipalities
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
the power to approve uh all licenses as
 
04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
another criteria empowers municipalities
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
to choose to limit or prohibit uh
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
establishments and this bill requires
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities to vote in the
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
affirmative in order to have retail
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
establishments and reduces the
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
incidences of multi-drug use it
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
establishes funds and mechanisms for
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
drug abuse education prevention and
 
04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
treatment and now here's the one that I
 
04:33:28.029 --> 04:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
only give it a half check mark does not
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
impose an additional tax so so as to
 
04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
remain competitive this bill is called
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
an agency fee of 10%
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh but it would impose a new tax but the
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
other Bill uh that the commission was
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
working on also had a 15% tax so those
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
two uh are different but they uh you
 
04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
know with this one being more
 
04:33:54.029 --> 04:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
competitive uh but they both do impose a
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
tax and raise uh considerable funds and
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
finally I'd just like to make uh one new
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
point and that is uh I just became aware
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
of a new uh research report put out by
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
the Centers for Disease Control and
 
04:34:11.830 --> 04:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
prevention uh looking at uh youth
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis youth use after legalization in
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
Washington state and uh they studied the
 
04:34:24.670 --> 04:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
uh eth graders 10th graders and 12th
 
04:34:28.349 --> 04:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
graders rate of cannabis use prior to
 
04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
legalization and then what happened
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
after legalization and here's just a
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
paragraph I'd like to read from that
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
study study the observed overall
 
04:34:40.029 --> 04:34:40.039 align:start position:0%
decreases in cannabis use among students
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
in grades 8 10 and 12 might be
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
associated with changes in the
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
availability of cannabis among persons
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
aged over 21 as well as limited
 
04:34:53.070 --> 04:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to engage in use the
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
period 2012 through
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
2014 includes the legalization of
 
04:35:01.070 --> 04:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
non-medical cannabis in Washington state
 
04:35:04.349 --> 04:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
in 2012 researchers studied the
 
04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
association of cannabis laws with
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis use among high school students
 
04:35:11.470 --> 04:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
and have observed similar declines in
 
04:35:14.429 --> 04:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis use after legalization of
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
non-medical cannabis the legalization of
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
non-medical cannabis for adults aged
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
over 21 in Washington with decree with
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
licensed dispensaries requiring proof of
 
04:35:28.949 --> 04:35:28.959 align:start position:0%
age might have affected availability of
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis to younger persons as well as
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
their opportunities to engage in use and
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
I attended most of the Cannabis
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
commission hearings and we heard a lot
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
of concern and rightly so of whether
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
legalization would increase the use
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
among young people and actually the
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
Center for Disease Control research is
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
finding that just the opposite is
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
happening in other states so it's
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
certainly not a foregone conclusion and
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
I've sent the link to that report to the
 
04:36:01.869 --> 04:36:01.879 align:start position:0%
chair and uh encourage you to take a
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
look at that uh because I think it's
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
pretty revealing uh very interesting so
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank for you for your time and thanks
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
for all your hard work on this okay
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
up uh good afternoon everybody my name
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
is Ryan Nicks uh I am the supervisory
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
intelligence Analyst at the New
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information analysis Center
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
our Center as mentioned uh in the origin
 
04:36:36.590 --> 04:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
original drafting of this bill and it's
 
04:36:38.830 --> 04:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
also mentioned in the most revised copy
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to take a moment and just
 
04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
speak to the statutory obligations that
 
04:36:44.349 --> 04:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
have been outlined in the bill and how
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
that is uh more or less doomed uh from
 
04:36:48.990 --> 04:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
the start just in terms of what we are
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
legally uh allowed to collect or what we
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
by base of policy and procedure have
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
access to collect um I've worked for the
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety for 11 years um my
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
politics aren't relevant nor is my
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
really position on this bill I'm
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
speaking specific to what are outlined
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
as mandates or uh statutory expectations
 
04:37:14.310 --> 04:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
of what our Center can or cannot do I
 
04:37:19.150 --> 04:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
would politely bring you to page 30 line
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
28 is what I'll be speaking to and in my
 
04:37:24.670 --> 04:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
seven years of working uh at the
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
information six years of working at the
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
information analysis Center I spent all
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
of that time in some way shape or form
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the oversight of or the
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
publication of the drug monitoring
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
initiative the data sets that go into
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
that its history and its perspective
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
Outlook um that's a longer conversation
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
but even just in the first few lines
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
here uh no later than six months after
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
the effective data this chapter and
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
every two years thereafter we shall
 
04:37:54.269 --> 04:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
produce a report uh that speaks to all a
 
04:37:55.869 --> 04:37:55.879 align:start position:0%
bunch of subsequent uh Health and
 
04:37:55.879 --> 04:37:56.949 align:start position:0%
bunch of subsequent uh Health and
Welfare

04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
Welfare
 
04:37:59.310 --> 04:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes I just would like to bring you
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
back and show you a brief history of
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
kind of the drug environment report and
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
the drug monitoring initiative if that's
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
okay sge
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
um that started as a request in the New
 
04:38:10.029 --> 04:38:10.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs of Police Association
 
04:38:11.390 --> 04:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
in the fall of
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
2013 directly in response to increased
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement reports or reportings to
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
fatal and non-fatal heroin overdoses at
 
04:38:24.029 --> 04:38:24.039 align:start position:0%
the time uh that took approximately I
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
believe 11 months uh to get up and
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
running and simply identify the partners
 
04:38:31.230 --> 04:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
and the memorandums of understanding and
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
the uh memos of agreement between
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
agencies simply within the department of
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
safety for data collection then it took
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
us an additional I believe 9 to 11
 
04:38:44.349 --> 04:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
months to get that public out for public
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
consumption so simply within the
 
04:38:48.910 --> 04:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
department that took approximately two
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
years to identify and Aggregate and put
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
together all the data and collect and
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
identify those sources to produce that
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
product mostly within the department
 
04:39:00.990 --> 04:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
itself not including the office of the
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner the Department of
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Bureau of drug
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
and alcohol Services etc etc um so from
 
04:39:10.269 --> 04:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
the first line here within 6 months of
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
passing this bill or enacting this
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
chapter um we would simply I would not
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
be able to meet that obligation to you
 
04:39:18.670 --> 04:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently there are policy
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
and procedure as well as statutory um um
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
barriers to fulfilling some of these
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
requirement that I uh certainly not the
 
04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:30.039 align:start position:0%
most educated to speak on uh but I felt
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
it was worth coming here being the one
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
who um QA qc's and oversees that product
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
as well as the one who's put it together
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the last several years to just speak
 
04:39:41.070 --> 04:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
about some of the statutory expectations
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
that um are put on our Center and how we
 
04:39:47.150 --> 04:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
will not be able to meet those um and I
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
look forward to continuing the
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
conversation and answering any questions
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
that you have so um so really it should
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
be two years to get your first Baseline
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
right uh at least right so I mean after
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
two years you'll have a you can then be
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
looking back where when when the bill
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
goes into uh if I could interject for
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
one second of the information that
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
currently appears in that drug Mar
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
initiative is actually owned by somebody
 
04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
else it is not owned by the IAC it's
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
owned by the chief medical examiner
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
officers uh DHS uh drug and alcohol uh
 
04:40:25.788 --> 04:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
service and uh division of EMS so they
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
have a actual uh way to collect that
 
04:40:30.310 --> 04:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
information they're the ones doing the
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
surveys they're the ones receiving this
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
information they're able to provide us
 
04:40:36.190 --> 04:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
with that data set that we can then
 
04:40:39.070 --> 04:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
produce a product to show so okay so
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
would it be better if we just take all
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
this out here and say
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
every two years after effect that you
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
can give us a summary on anything you
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
think that would be relative for us to
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
understand the marijuana consumption in
 
04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
the state only if there is a viable data
 
04:40:57.628 --> 04:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
set of information that we could analyze
 
04:40:58.830 --> 04:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of potentials and
 
04:41:00.270 --> 04:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals that I'm probably not
 
04:41:02.430 --> 04:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
positioned to speak to or answer today
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
right well I just wondering how would
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
you rewrite this because obviously that
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
they wrote this all hoping you know
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
fantasizing that they could get all this
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
data but as we all know that those data
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
points were probably impossible
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
obviously you know high school you know
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
rate adult rates of alcohol I mean I
 
04:41:21.550 --> 04:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
mean how would anybody know any of these
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
numbers but you know these surveys that
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
are taken out there but yes
 
04:41:25.520 --> 04:41:26.670 align:start position:0%
are taken out there but yes
representative

04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
Calabro haven't been the QA medical lead
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
at Harbor Care Health and Wellness
 
04:41:33.070 --> 04:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
Clinic um that information can be
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
collected at various clinics deciding
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
which ones you want to basically do
 
04:41:39.150 --> 04:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
those treatments um I think that's
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
information that is entirely possible as
 
04:41:44.590 --> 04:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
QA medical lead I think you can do all
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
of these things it's timec consuming and
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
I know it's cumbersome believe me I I've
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
had enough
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
statistics I think we want to keep this
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
simple because the last thing you want
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
to do is have this paragraph bog us down
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
going forward with this legislation not
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
in six months but maybe in in two years
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
but I think it's viable
 
04:42:09.150 --> 04:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
okay so what we want is you is for you
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
guys to figure out how we would write
 
04:42:16.750 --> 04:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
this paragraph to State what the general
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
concept is to do this um and you can put
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
in all the qualifiers you can based upon
 
04:42:24.750 --> 04:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
what data are you've been allowed to
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
have access to you know just whatever
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
qualifiers you want to put in here to to
 
04:42:32.590 --> 04:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
you know meet the needs that you what
 
04:42:38.030 --> 04:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
possible I haven't really de depart
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with the Department of Safety too
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
much I used to know I don't believe this
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
typically falls under my duties that
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
sign to write State legislation yeah I'm
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
saying maybe I can maybe I can have your
 
04:42:56.320 --> 04:42:57.230 align:start position:0%
saying maybe I can maybe I can have your
former

04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
former
 
04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
Trooper the chief of enforcement to to
 
04:43:02.910 --> 04:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
write it because he's now getting
 
04:43:04.830 --> 04:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
getting used to my asking these request
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
but I guess we given that I have no idea
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
that you people even
 
04:43:12.990 --> 04:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
existed okay and apparently uh somebody
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
did when they wrote the Bill somebody
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
thought our our argument is that we
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
would not be in the position to write
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
anything currently um because we are
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
unaware of any programs that exist that
 
04:43:28.750 --> 04:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
would collect all of the
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
information I have absolutely no doubt
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
in my mind there's no way you collect
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
all this of any juvenile records that
 
04:43:37.150 --> 04:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
they want from the court right which is
 
04:43:40.590 --> 04:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
prohibited by RSA one there you go okay
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
so you but you could go through this and
 
04:43:45.310 --> 04:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
know what you can and can't do
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
right on one on a few small seconds yes
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
but there's other sections of this that
 
04:43:53.230 --> 04:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
it's not our then I I don't put it in
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
saying inform I I want you to to um uh
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
pretend like you're Ai and you're just
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to go through in there and delete
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
out everything you can't do and
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
whatever's left of what you know you can
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
do is that
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
possible I know this is a task you're
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
not used to taking
 
04:44:17.230 --> 04:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
on I'm not in a position to be writing
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislation for uh this committee or
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
this group uh but we would be willing to
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
work with them if they come up with
 
04:44:27.150 --> 04:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
their own another set of but how would
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
she know what you can't so how about you
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
go through there and cross out
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
everything you can't
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
do how about about that can you cross
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
out what you don't think you can do I
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
mean I'm trying to how do I make this
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
dialogue you you're going to ask her to
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
rewrite something and she's writing it
 
04:44:46.350 --> 04:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum because she doesn't know
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
anything what you can and can't do okay
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
only you guys know that so how do we how
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
do we solve this chicken of the egg how
 
04:44:57.230 --> 04:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
do we to me the easiest thing for you to
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
do is go in there and cross out anything
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
that you you have no way of doing maybe
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
there nothing left that document what's
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
that which would be a lot of that
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
document we're we're not the ones who go
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
out and send out these surveys right
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're not reaching out to people this
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
information and that would be the
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
qualifier right saying that that it
 
04:45:17.830 --> 04:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
would be need to be a mechanism that all
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
this information is being that the that
 
04:45:22.830 --> 04:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
these assuming you would start out by
 
04:45:25.390 --> 04:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
saying assuming what you're capable of
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
acquiring that data that you're capable
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
that that are are that you have been
 
04:45:31.948 --> 04:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
able to receive I don't know what's what
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
the right qualifier how you would like
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
to to write
 
04:45:39.230 --> 04:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
that I would argue that her I don't know
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
how our name of our uh Center came to be
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
oh you just want to be out of this bill
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
alog together now I get it I would argue
 
04:45:48.190 --> 04:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're not the best position to
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
report on Health and Welfare outcomes
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
that not our responsibility or our job
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay perfect got it you one out I got it
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay Kate where did
 
04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:00.520 align:start position:0%

from
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah who is anybody in the room going to
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph I I know
 
04:46:17.160 --> 04:46:19.110 align:start position:0%
paragraph I I know
but

04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:46:19.120 --> 04:46:21.230 align:start position:0%
but
1639

04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
1639
 
04:46:23.670 --> 04:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
is well let me put it this way I didn't
 
04:46:23.680 --> 04:46:24.948 align:start position:0%
is well let me put it this way I didn't
write

04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
write
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
it no there's nobody in the room going
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
paragraph

04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
right because evidently no one told them
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
that they were in this
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
bill well obviously somebody they they
 
04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
were here they got wind of it yeah know
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying they never got wind of
 
04:46:52.350 --> 04:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
it until till
 
04:46:52.360 --> 04:46:54.030 align:start position:0%
it until till
yesterday

04:46:54.030 --> 04:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:46:54.040 --> 04:47:01.830 align:start position:0%
yesterday
so

04:47:01.830 --> 04:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
um all right so I mean in would you be
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
offended if we take this out of the
 
04:47:16.150 --> 04:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill so this is 318 f24 page 30 page
 
04:47:18.830 --> 04:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
30 question I'm I'm assuming you would
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
be be the person who would be coach you
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
know cheering for this but in the
 
04:47:26.350 --> 04:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
meantime while you look at it yes
 
04:47:28.110 --> 04:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative collabro you have a
 
04:47:30.390 --> 04:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
question wouldn't this be the purview of
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS I mean this is the data that we
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
somebody came yeah this I do have a hand
 
04:47:40.680 --> 04:47:41.948 align:start position:0%
somebody came yeah this I do have a hand
for

04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
counsel yes yeah that's right you were
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
happened okay get in speak to the mic
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.548 --> 04:48:03.558 align:start position:0%
are you can turn the mic on yeah Paul
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you do I have to hold it no okay
 
04:48:08.110 --> 04:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Paul Tumi I'm former house
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
legal councel I'm a member of the
 
04:48:12.030 --> 04:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Coalition I've been working
 
04:48:15.070 --> 04:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
with marijuana policy project and ACLU
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
for years on these bills and probably
 
04:48:20.670 --> 04:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
drafted a lot of um the bill that this
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
originally came from but not this
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
section but I agree with what the
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative just said that this is
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
really a function of Health and Human
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
Services and you could either just put
 
04:48:31.470 --> 04:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
it in there and ask them to do a report
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
or take it completely out and address
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
address it with a separate I mean you
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
got two years to get some kind of a
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
report out of after reading the last
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
sentence I think this is the reason why
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
I was given to
 
04:48:47.310 --> 04:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
Liz he he threw you guys under the bus
 
04:48:52.990 --> 04:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
when he began his testimony he said the
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
chief of police asked for heroin
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
information and that's how he started
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
collecting this data do you know
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
anything about this
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:09.830 align:start position:0%
anything about this
paragraph

04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to deny that
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
Kate what's that yes we should we can
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
delete it I feel it's mixed I feel you
 
04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
have two different entities that you're
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
asking to provide information each of
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
them equally able to do so but they're
 
04:49:30.788 --> 04:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
two different entities I what I find is
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
striking is how did how dides anybody
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
expect it to get paid for
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm not from the Department the
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
individual who is no she used to be used
 
04:49:42.270 --> 04:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
to be with the health and human services
 
04:49:44.590 --> 04:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
I I do want to clar so this information
 
04:49:46.590 --> 04:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
has been in here from the very beginning
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
right obviously we want some indicators
 
04:49:50.910 --> 04:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
because we want to know whether or not
 
04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's an impact on many of these
 
04:49:56.670 --> 04:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
things so I do import I do uh think um
 
04:49:58.110 --> 04:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of some of this is
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
important a lot of this data though is
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
already available either from the
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Service
 
04:50:06.628 --> 04:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
or the department of safety so I think
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter the department of
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
safety has just made clear they don't
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
want to be in this bill they want out
 
04:50:14.670 --> 04:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
and that they get their that whatever
 
04:50:16.548 --> 04:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
data they get is people are nice enough
 
04:50:18.510 --> 04:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
to give it to them but what motor
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle they don't have data on Motor
 
04:50:22.510 --> 04:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles that's who they were Department
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
safety okay um but I do believe that
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
some kind of data collection is really
 
04:50:30.270 --> 04:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
important I would defer to the
 
04:50:31.948 --> 04:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:50:34.030 --> 04:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
I think they have a lot of this data
 
04:50:35.708 --> 04:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
can't speak till like if there would be
 
04:50:37.628 --> 04:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note I don't I wouldn't take
 
04:50:39.788 --> 04:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
the whole section out but well I'm going
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
to take the whole section out because I
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
don't know who's going to do
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it do you have a friend you can call it
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
HHS to find out yeah he's here he just
 
04:50:53.590 --> 04:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
stepped out I'll I'll ask him
 
04:50:56.110 --> 04:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right does anybody else have
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
something else they want to point out
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
and representative Gibbs
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah you just made the point that I
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
was going to make actually which is that
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
while this data would be useful to have
 
04:51:14.190 --> 04:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think it's crucial to the
 
04:51:16.708 --> 04:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
bill and maybe just delete that whole
 
04:51:16.718 --> 04:51:18.510 align:start position:0%
bill and maybe just delete that whole
paragraph

04:51:18.510 --> 04:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
04:51:18.520 --> 04:51:20.510 align:start position:0%
paragraph
okay

04:51:20.510 --> 04:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:23.788 --> 04:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
great there he is oh yes there's
 
04:51:23.798 --> 04:51:25.628 align:start position:0%
great there he is oh yes there's
HHS

04:51:25.628 --> 04:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
04:51:28.910 --> 04:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
but so did did you know do you guys do
 
04:51:31.948 --> 04:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
atc's uh for the record my name name is
 
04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
Michael Hol I'm the administrator of the
 
04:51:36.750 --> 04:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program with the
 
04:51:39.150 --> 04:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take your
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
questions do You' seen this paragraph
 
04:51:46.990 --> 04:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
before uh yes I've seen the paragraph um
 
04:51:49.310 --> 04:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh I believe this paragraph has been in
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
the bill in various Inc incarnations you
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
know for a number of years or versions
 
04:51:58.548 --> 04:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
um we uh recently explored this a little
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
bit more because there was there's a
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
couple data points that HHS um uh feels
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be are important um especially
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
with with regard to um uh childhood
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
poisonings um and accidental ingestions
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
so we added there um added that in here
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
we also added in a provision um to when
 
04:52:18.110 --> 04:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
you say added that in so you you were
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
actually helped contribute this oh yes I
 
04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
I we were working I was working with uh
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lon on some of the
 
04:52:27.670 --> 04:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
language that impacts HHS okay um so the
 
04:52:30.030 --> 04:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
structure here has been in legislation
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
for some versions probably years long I
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
do not know who or wrote that the drug
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring initiative would publish all
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
this data so I don't know the origins of
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
that but based on what has been in this
 
04:52:44.590 --> 04:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
bill all this time we're looking at the
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
data the data sets and we believe that
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
it's important to know uh if accidental
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
childhood ingestions increase after
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
legalization it's a critical piece that
 
04:52:59.310 --> 04:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
you know prevention um uh Specialists
 
04:53:02.310 --> 04:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know uh want to know about cannabis
 
04:53:04.830 --> 04:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
legalization so that's the that was the
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
Genesis of my recent involvement in this
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
section um so we also added the the
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
provision that um Department of Safety
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
would collaborate with the people who
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
hold the data um the the entities
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
holding the data include ocme the office
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the chief medical examiner HHS and
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to graduation rate
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that's you know Department of
 
04:53:26.708 --> 04:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
Education um obviously any data sharing
 
04:53:29.190 --> 04:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
is going to require inou between
 
04:53:31.868 --> 04:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
agencies um we do these uh on a regular
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
basis the collaboration requirement um
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
here in the statute would give us the
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
authority to collaborate and enter into
 
04:53:41.548 --> 04:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
M and data sharing agreements with other
 
04:53:44.830 --> 04:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
agencies um I do not know who is the
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
holder of all of these data sets um I
 
04:53:51.310 --> 04:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
can go back to HHS and determine which
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
data sets we currently hold um and
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
report back to this committee if you
 
04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
like um I I do not I'm not an expert in
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
all of these data sets but it is
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
important um for cannabis legalization
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
effort to establish Baseline Data before
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
the program starts so that we know the
 
04:54:13.230 --> 04:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
impacts of cannabis legalization moving
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
forward after legalization you heard
 
04:54:17.788 --> 04:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
about a reference from the CDC um by a
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
previous uh speaker um about uh before
 
04:54:22.030 --> 04:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
and after with regard to Washington
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
State so uh from a public health
 
04:54:26.270 --> 04:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint you know Baseline data and
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know what happens after legalization
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
is just critical information for the
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
state to have to know what the impact is
 
04:54:34.750 --> 04:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
so I would I would urge this paragraph
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
be left in um and allow us to come back
 
04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
with some uh some other information um
 
04:54:46.270 --> 04:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to or more clarity on who
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
holds these data sets um and uh if we
 
04:54:51.310 --> 04:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
can if there's another entity we can add
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
in that that other entity if these data
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
sets don't exist we'll you know we can
 
04:54:58.030 --> 04:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
take them out but let's let us take a
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
first stab at you know who holds the
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
data and us being Health and Human
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
Services Health and Human servic okay so
 
04:55:06.190 --> 04:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look forward you guys to
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
rewrite this paragraph based upon your
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
the Department's capabilities of getting
 
04:55:10.798 --> 04:55:11.708 align:start position:0%
the Department's capabilities of getting
this

04:55:11.708 --> 04:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
done we will work in collaboration with
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
the drug Department of Safety because
 
04:55:20.910 --> 04:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
the the the requirement here is that the
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety's drug
 
04:55:25.830 --> 04:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring uh
 
04:55:29.070 --> 04:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
initiative publishes the data now again
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not an expert here I'll we
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
will collaborate with uh the the DMI um
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
on on publishing location um I don't
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
know if that's the best place or maybe
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
it is the best place so happy to get
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
back to you with some more information
 
04:55:46.548 --> 04:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
but I can't commit to you know giving
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
you the the be all and all policy on
 
04:55:50.430 --> 04:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
here I'm really looking for I'm just
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
looking for a department to do this okay
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
and I just got one Department that says
 
04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
please do not make us do this so so I'm
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
ask I'm looking to Health and Human
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
Services now to take a look at this
 
04:56:04.270 --> 04:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph this is why we don't come to
 
04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
the meetings right you know because we
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
gotta sign
 
04:56:11.868 --> 04:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
things in hindsight right so um
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would have just taken it
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
out otherwise we' just rip it out in
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
other words if I if we can't have
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who is willing to take it on
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
knows what you can and can't do okay and
 
04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
the language could simply say is um have
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
a plan and how you're gonna go about
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
doing this like emmo you know getting
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
your you know letters of understanding
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
doing writing out that dialogue about
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
how you're going to best do it and uh
 
04:56:41.230 --> 04:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
how the frequency you feel comfortable
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
doing it and the cost it's going to take
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
and all all that and I assume there must
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
be a fysal note attached to this I'm
 
04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
happy to to to regroup with um our team
 
04:56:52.030 --> 04:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the uh Department of
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
Safety staff um and uh determine uh and
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
give a recommendation on how best to uh
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
proceed with this element and rewrite
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
this paragraphs for next
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
week okay otherwise commit to doing my
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise it'll be gone and then you'll
 
04:57:07.110 --> 04:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
have to wait till it gets on the Senate
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
side or or Ways and Means and maybe we
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
we will have some even if it's where
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
available language um you can put all
 
04:57:17.628 --> 04:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
the qualifiers you want in here for me
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
excellent okay I'll take I'll take all
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifiers I just so you can at
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
least have a placeholder how's that
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
sounds good representative
 
04:57:29.230 --> 04:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
Gibs I was just going to suggest that
 
04:57:31.390 --> 04:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
since so many other states have already
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana in so far as data
 
04:57:36.990 --> 04:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
exists on these types of questions I
 
04:57:39.628 --> 04:57:39.638 align:start position:0%
would assume that they have data why do
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
we need to represent why do we need to
 
04:57:46.270 --> 04:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
reinvent the Wheel by collecting our own
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
data New Hampshire isn't that different
 
04:57:53.230 --> 04:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts or Maine or Vermont
 
04:57:55.510 --> 04:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh I mean sure there are differences but
 
04:57:59.070 --> 04:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
we're all human beings why not just look
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
for data from other
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
states I would just offer that many
 
04:58:06.548 --> 04:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
states don't establish Baseline Data
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
before they legalize um and the the
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hallmark of this uh proposal is that New
 
04:58:13.708 --> 04:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should establish Baseline data
 
04:58:18.270 --> 04:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much thank you see
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
you next
 
04:58:25.868 --> 04:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
week represent do you have an opinion on
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.110 --> 04:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph sorry yes that uh paragraph
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
was in the amendment because there was
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
some more clarity about who would be
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
working with everybody so I will work
 
04:58:41.788 --> 04:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
with them in order to come with an
 
04:58:44.830 --> 04:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
amendment um there was one other if if
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
if we're good with this one there is one
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
other section as well where it been
 
04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
raised in the hallway with me um it was
 
04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
around the analment language and just
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
the idea that the way that it's written
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
there could be some uh confusion about
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
how to implement it and to just add the
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
words that um not no more than The
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
Possession limit but no more than the
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
current possession limit so that there's
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
not a question about whether it was at
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
the time of the conviction or currently
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I'll bring that language as an
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendment as well we can talk about it
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
at that point but I didn't want to
 
04:59:16.708 --> 04:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
Blindside you with another section being
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
changed okay so what what works fine is
 
04:59:22.110 --> 04:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
it would have the amendment drawn up yes
 
04:59:24.430 --> 04:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
okay and then when uh the committee
 
04:59:25.948 --> 04:59:25.958 align:start position:0%
takes up the sub when we take up the
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee next week we can just vote
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments okay and then bundle
 
04:59:32.670 --> 04:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
them together and send them off to
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
legisl services so by the time the
 
04:59:36.910 --> 04:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee votes on it it will have the
 
04:59:39.708 --> 04:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
final okay so to do that and stack
 
04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
within this amendment so starting with
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
this one and then have the amendment on
 
04:59:45.628 --> 04:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
you can put all the ones that you know
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
of yeah then yeah into one to to do that
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
that section f24 and then the analment
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
to add the current possession exactly
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
okay to just and let saying is it's okay
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
if they were separate if they had to
 
05:00:02.110 --> 05:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
be okay because legislative Services can
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
handle that words we can vote multiple
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
amendments to a bill but that if you can
 
05:00:08.350 --> 05:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
throw it all into one and get it all
 
05:00:11.788 --> 05:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
done that's even better okay and if um I
 
05:00:13.628 --> 05:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
I assume that any language we get on the
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
data collection is probably going to be
 
05:00:18.070 --> 05:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
better than what we have exactly um so
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
well because we we we you know I don't
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
know how long you've been in the room
 
05:00:23.670 --> 05:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
but yeah we're yeah we're you heard you
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
heard where we left it yes no I just
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
moved over so that I could have some of
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
that back conversation so we'll we'll
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
get the new language on f24 and then
 
05:00:33.390 --> 05:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
just add that word current into the an M
 
05:00:36.590 --> 05:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
which would add to that Amendment um and
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
just move forward from there for you
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you okay is there anything
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.350 --> 05:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
piece are we G to be going into stuff
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
now or going into stuff now or next week
 
05:00:58.830 --> 05:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
oh no no I
 
05:01:01.390 --> 05:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
we we can't we don't have all the
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we need to do to
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
raise all concerns and stuff next week
 
05:01:06.390 --> 05:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
or next time we talk what concerns do
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about well I don't have
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of time cuz I have to be somewhere
 
05:01:12.990 --> 05:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
be in Berlin at five okay I don't know
 
05:01:14.590 --> 05:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
how long is it Berlin that's way up
 
05:01:16.750 --> 05:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
there it's two hours two hours leave
 
05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
soon so that means you got to leave
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
right now right so I don't know if we
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
want to get into it now or well when
 
05:01:23.310 --> 05:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
when did you when did you run down the
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
list and then I'll decide basically want
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
is there's one one one thing that I
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
really want changed
 
05:01:33.868 --> 05:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
is I don't like the 15 the 15 I can deal
 
05:01:36.510 --> 05:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
with that what I don't like is the idea
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
that there's just this REM meting or the
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
commission will meet every five years or
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
whatever to no that's gone she says it's
 
05:01:46.190 --> 05:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
now every
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
year she had I might have Miss that when
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
I went to the restroom but well that's
 
05:01:54.670 --> 05:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.230 --> 05:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
said uh it's she you're you want to
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
repeat it so why don't you stay here so
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
you let me hear what you what you said
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking and I'll my meeting
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
so uh the way that it it now is in this
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it's 15 stores and
 
05:02:14.430 --> 05:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
after 30 30 months after enactment they
 
05:02:15.910 --> 05:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
would assess whether or not there needs
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
to be more and then to reassess it every
 
05:02:21.548 --> 05:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
year annually annually but there's no
 
05:02:23.910 --> 05:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no tripping
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to say that based on this
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
condition it would increase it leaves it
 
05:02:32.190 --> 05:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
entirely to Theiss so that that is not
 
05:02:33.788 --> 05:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what I I think we need because
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
I've raised this with you John I don't
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
like the idea of creating medallions
 
05:02:38.190 --> 05:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
this is going to create The Medallion
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
system or the Montana liquor right I got
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
it so what I like to avoid that is to
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
have some fixed number that every 30
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
months or three years or whatever they
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
are become available so maybe there's
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
three licenses that become available so
 
05:02:55.708 --> 05:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
how did you like my language about
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
market area the market area analysis and
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
the commission would then do yeah I I
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
would rather have it just be fixed
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
because the market decide if
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's or fixes fixes veto bait is what
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
veto governor with veto if if you put
 
05:03:14.590 --> 05:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
but see the the reality of it is and I
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
think that this cons I know there's a I
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
don't like most of this but I'm like
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
willing to compromise in much of it but
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
and I and I talked to her and I think a
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
lot of good is in here I raised the
 
05:03:25.548 --> 05:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
analment thing that I thought was
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
confusing because that's like the key
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
part for me but this is the other key
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
part for me okay creating Medallion
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
system is bad this is going to do that
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
we know it's going to do it we know the
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
people who get these licenses are going
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
to do their damnest to build a mode
 
05:03:39.310 --> 05:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
around their businesses we've seen it in
 
05:03:41.590 --> 05:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
industry and after industry
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's a huge ton of literature of
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
economic history that shows plenty of
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
examples of this happening and we're
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
setting it up now so but when I had my
 
05:03:52.868 --> 05:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
paragraph what I thought I was
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
brilliant was that you mean the one you
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
gave us last week and then we told the
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
new one was coming I didn't read it so I
 
05:03:59.350 --> 05:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
can go back and look so anyway so it's
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
the yellow section and and if you like a
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
copy of it you can have it here and in
 
05:04:07.868 --> 05:04:07.878 align:start position:0%
it it says that the commission would do
 
05:04:09.310 --> 05:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
a market
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
analysis and so therefore would expand
 
05:04:15.390 --> 05:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
make recommendation for expansion based
 
05:04:18.670 --> 05:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
on that market analysis so it could come
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
back and say we need another 30
 
05:04:24.270 --> 05:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
stores I I'll look at it I mean it seems
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
to me like doing the market analysis
 
05:04:28.510 --> 05:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
opens a door for them to be influenced
 
05:04:30.910 --> 05:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
by okay well now you get back to the
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
what the governor wants was the that the
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
lobbying no lobbying you know you that
 
05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
that nobody who who's been given a store
 
05:04:42.270 --> 05:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
is allowed to Lobby the
 
05:04:44.990 --> 05:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislature that that's which is not in
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
here you didn't put it in here at all
 
05:04:48.070 --> 05:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you that's the reason
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
why the governor did that okay well so
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
you're ask you're basically saying he's
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
worried if he's worried you're saying
 
05:04:56.350 --> 05:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's right if he's worried
 
05:04:58.990 --> 05:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
about their them
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
lobing around their industry then then
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
he then he should be and not want to
 
05:05:04.830 --> 05:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
veto my
 
05:05:07.868 --> 05:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
suggestion okay all right he was working
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
about them being the lobbyist to making
 
05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
sure that that I think that they should
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
have a right to Lobby in in a lot of
 
05:05:15.788 --> 05:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
ways they should they shouldn't have a
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
right to create build walls around their
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
their businesses okay um all right
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
anyways we can bring up next time I have
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
to be somewhere all right what other
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
complaint what other concerns you have
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
or is that that that is it like the
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
other ones have been largely addressed
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
but that one that one's like a key
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
sticking point that one and the en
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
helment thing were the two okay and uh I
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
mean it sounds like we're gonna take
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
care of and um I I in terms of expansion
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
and putting in hard numbers in into the
 
05:05:48.310 --> 05:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it's extremely
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
problematic I mean you're you're being
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
variable about your numbers about what
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
numbers you
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
want what does that even mean I'm being
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
variable what do you mean you're saying
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay I want uh five stores
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
every five years or you 10 stores or
 
05:06:04.350 --> 05:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
want 30 stores or how many stores do you
 
05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
want and what time period were you
 
05:06:07.708 --> 05:06:07.718 align:start position:0%
thinking I just want there to be a
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism where if the market wants more
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
stores they can get it and your language
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
does not state that your language could
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
vary in 30 years from now here's your
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
here's your project have your come up
 
05:06:25.110 --> 05:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
with your solution that you solution
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
what's that what's your solution you
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
just a mechanism so mechanism build
 
05:06:31.030 --> 05:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
every every three years every three
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
years a certain number number we can
 
05:06:34.708 --> 05:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
decide the number what number tell us
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
the number now we'll say three three
 
05:06:39.070 --> 05:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
three licenses become available every
 
05:06:40.990 --> 05:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
every three years fine if there's no
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
Market available for them then then they
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
they won't be taken but if there are
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
then we know that that what if there's
 
05:06:48.510 --> 05:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
more okay what if the market wants more
 
05:06:52.510 --> 05:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
so represent are you okay with every
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
three years another three Stores um I
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
think we'd want to look at what the
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
analysis of what the actual Market
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
capacity is if it's actually a market
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
clearing um scenario 55 stores that
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
would take a long time to get from that
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
15 to 55 but I do like the idea of
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
opening up a certain number of licenses
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
because this is going to be a market as
 
05:07:14.270 --> 05:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
it evolves I don't if we have a number
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
where they're not all taken I think
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
that's actually a good position to be in
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'd be happy to discuss what a
 
05:07:22.750 --> 05:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
number would make would make sense that
 
05:07:22.760 --> 05:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
number would make would make sense that
that's

05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
fine she going to be doing the amendment
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
you can work that sounds good all right
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
and uh additionally I had one other
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
thing about the lobbying um we had the
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier today with chairs and
 
05:07:37.030 --> 05:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
vice chairs about the idea of state
 
05:07:39.390 --> 05:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
employees um so state employees are able
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
to come and speak and Lobby to us um
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's actually exempt from lobbying yes
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
so the idea of having a carve out for
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
franchises would be a problem um anybody
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
who has is employed based upon it with
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
their testimony would need to register
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
as a lobbyist but if you're just having
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you're a volunteer then you don't so
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
we already have clear language around
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
lobbying and trying to change it around
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
one industry would be highly problematic
 
05:08:04.708 --> 05:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
we have areas that are very much a
 
05:08:06.990 --> 05:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
medallion system in the state and I
 
05:08:08.548 --> 05:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
think that doing special treatment here
 
05:08:11.548 --> 05:08:11.558 align:start position:0%
instead of others is problematic fair
 
05:08:13.708 --> 05:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
enough all right so but you will work
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
with him on his expansion language okay
 
05:08:22.628 --> 05:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.200 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
right
