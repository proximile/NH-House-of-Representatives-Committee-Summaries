00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everybody uh glad to
 
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
see you all here
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be addressing House
 
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 as such we're going to go
 
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 as such we're going to go
through

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
the oplc's press release
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
as a team which is a teaser of things
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
that are alleged that are included in
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 which is not yet out
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
the finance committee has said that Edna
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
if Edna takes a position on any of these
 
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
parts they'll follow it so
 
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do today is identify
 
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
which parts we need more information on
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
which parts we can leave alone and which
 
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
parts we've covered elsewhere
 
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.069 align:start position:0%
parts we've covered elsewhere
so

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
um triage essentially
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll end up with a long list of
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions and action items
 
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
I presume so uh since we have a couple
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
of people here to talk about the Wetland
 
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.749 align:start position:0%
of people here to talk about the Wetland
scientist

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
scientist
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
license which is being
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
which is number 34 on the list of
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
licenses to be eliminated I'd like to
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
have them
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
tell us what the problem would be if
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
their license would be eliminated
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
gentlemen if you could
 
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:08.450 align:start position:0%
gentlemen if you could
see

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'll start out by saying that I know
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
that like
 
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
um Professional Engineers the
 
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
certification and the
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
continuing continuing education is
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
primarily through a third party
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
Professional Organization so the
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
question is if you eliminate the state
 
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.830 align:start position:0%
question is if you eliminate the state
license

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
what comp what problems would that cause
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
you so please introduce yourself
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay first thing is you got to turn on
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
so we got a red lights out we're looking
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
for a red
 
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
we got it

I'm not going to read the letter thank
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome I know how that can
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
go but I will paraphrase from it just to
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
hit the highlights we don't need to know
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
how wonderful Wetland scientists are
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that as granted
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate that we
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
believe we serve a very valuable role
 
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
and function in the state
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to just talk uh in sort
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
of general terms and then get into some
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
specifics there are over 300 certified
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
folks in New Hampshire and that's a
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
pretty significant number we provide
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
some valuable services
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
to a lot of different folks from
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
development interests we're assuming
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
that to the municipalities and I will
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
speak to that because I am also on my
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
local Board of Select select board as
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
well as my local planning board and
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission so I could speak
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
to the land use boards personally
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
um through my experience with those
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
boards in my hometown
 
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.580 align:start position:0%
um which is what Goffstown
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
no seriously I mean we've got 34 of
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
these professions and we're not going to
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
say any of them is not necessary yeah
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
what we're going to say is we're trying
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
to decide is is a state license
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
necessary yes and assuming you've got
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
all the certification and training and
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
other wonderfulness
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think I can take a moment
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
to get to the Crux of what you're
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
looking for here in in that you know
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
what happens if the certification goes
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
away essentially no not the
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
certification or the license the license
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
the license
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important to recognize
 
00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:31.339 align:start position:0%
that the that the
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
certified Welton scientist in the in the
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
soil scientists in the state of New
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire play very important role as it
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
relates to economy in New Hampshire that
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
is that is we act as the liaison between
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
the developers and government officials
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't please what I'm trying to get
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
at is we do not want to say there will
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
not be Wetland scientists we don't want
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
to say there won't be certified Wetland
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
scientists what we want to say is after
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
you've got this your certification right
 
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:06.860 align:start position:0%
now you have to apply for state license
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
what does that license give you that the
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
certification does not that's what I'm
 
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
the license gives us the professional
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
the the expertise in providing the in
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
analyzing Wetlands looking at the
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
functions and values of wetlands and in
 
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
assisting with determining the boundary
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
between what areas are developable and
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
what what areas are not that's what your
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
certification your training and
 
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.550 align:start position:0%
certification your training and
experience

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
gives you what does the state license
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
give you
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
the state license gives us the
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
credentials to to demonstrate that we
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
have that knowledge and expertise to to
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
perform that analysis that's the only
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
thing they give you
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
because we do it we do a number of
 
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.370 align:start position:0%
because we do it we do a number of
things

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.590 align:start position:0%
things
we

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not getting through to you all right
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
so so here's the deal
 
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.870 align:start position:0%
so so here's the deal
um

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
you'd have the training you have the
 
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.730 align:start position:0%
you'd have the training you have the
certification

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
other than paying a fee I haven't looked
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
at it in detail but one of the main
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
requirements to actually get the license
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
is that you have the certification
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
so having the certification
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that you know you've done
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that certification organization
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
needs and probably most of what the
 
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
licensing would require you you are a
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland scientist the question
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
is what in a very practical sense would
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
you be unable to do if the license went
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
away but you still had certification
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.530 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
we would hope the short answer to that
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
is we would hope nothing
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
well that's excellent that says that the
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that that's as brief as
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
I can be no well that's that's exactly
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
right the uh in some cases that's what
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
it is yeah we would hope that if it was
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
converted from a certification to a
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
license the same standards would be in
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
effect and the individuals would still
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
be able to continue doing their work
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
exactly that's uh that's exactly right
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
we the license is something that when
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
you have your certification from your
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
your Professional Organization
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
you apply for the license and pay the
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
fee and then you get the state state
 
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
fee and then you get the state state
license

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
and in many cases that I noticed your
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
letter says there's very few complaints
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
the having the license doesn't Grant you
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
a great deal
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
of Authority or in or respect than your
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
representative please thank you
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
so in in in with some of the professions
 
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:08.300 align:start position:0%
uh the license
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
what the license does it says that you
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
can legally do that in this state
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the it's like driving
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
a car
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of 15 year olds who
 
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
probably can drive their their family
 
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.590 align:start position:0%
probably can drive their their family
car

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
um and maybe better than either one of
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
their parents can but the bottom line is
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
without the license they cannot legally
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
go out on the street the state roads
 
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
public roads and do it legally
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh and some professions are like that
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
too if you don't have the license no
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
matter how good you are how qualified
 
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
you are you cannot legally do it that's
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
correct okay so the and one of the
 
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:52.220 align:start position:0%
things that's being
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
considered is whether taking the license
 
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
considered is whether taking the license
away

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
harms you in any way along the lines of
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
what I was just talking about the
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
certification already says you can do it
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
but a license can be suspended or
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
revoked if you misbehave or if you're
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
ethically challenged or you do something
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
wrong or whatever you understand a
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
license is something that allows you to
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
legally operate take it away and you're
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
on practicing without a license because
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
the certification is enough to show that
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's that's difficult to to
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
just just to speak to on the fly but
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
what what I can say certainly is that
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
but I think that license you know
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
commits you
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
to adhering to that strong code of
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
ethics that that you're taught through
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's required by
 
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.990 align:start position:0%
it's required by
by

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
Des Wetlands Bureau administrative rule
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's also required by
 
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:16.940 align:start position:0%
um countless
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
municipalities around the state to have
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
a certified Wetland scientist stamp
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
plans much like a professional engineer
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
does ah so you have an official stamp
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
who gives you that
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
that is issued by the
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
oplc okay
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
and I and I know that's true for
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
engineers and land surveyors and and and
 
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects and so forth they
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
need in some jobs the customer Demands a
 
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.730 align:start position:0%
need in some jobs the customer Demands a
stamp

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:51.740 align:start position:0%
stamp
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
removing that license which is
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
associated with that stamp would be
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
problematic on a large scale level
 
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
problematic on a large scale level
because

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
so many municipalities are are tied to
 
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.430 align:start position:0%
so many municipalities are are tied to
that

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
every every municipality that I know of
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the Seacoast area requires plans to
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
be submitted with us by a by a certified
 
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:18.740 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientist
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
no problem with that whether it's a
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
licensed Wetland scientist that's the
 
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
licensed Wetland scientist that's the
distinction

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
all right that was a question that I had
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
for uh
Doug

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
Doug
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
I have for the oplc
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
what is the plan for providing stamps
 
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
for those who need it
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I would if you don't know the answer
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
we'll leave we'll just assign it as an
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you very much gentlemen I
 
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.210 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you very much gentlemen I
think

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
the issue is that if you if you're
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
calling yourself a certified Wetland
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
scientist that's not a problem but if
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
you if the
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
if they call for a licensed Wetland
 
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
scientist then we have to address that
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
issue and I think the stamp issue is
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
something that we need to address not
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
only for you but for the other
 
00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:19.699 align:start position:0%
professions that generally provide one
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
the technical professions just
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I think has a
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair so one of
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
the one of the other aspects that we
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
want you to consider uh
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
um is in some instances some professions
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
if they don't have a license
 
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:40.820 align:start position:0%
insurance won't pay for their services
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
okay now that may not be the case with
 
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:45.740 align:start position:0%
you but certainly in the medical field
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
without the license insurance won't pay
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that's the case for the
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
technical I I don't think so either but
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
but these are I I I I'm very supportive
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
of the current situation but but we're
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
trying to think Anew because some of the
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
some of these aspects are we have a
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
structure which is
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
which is seen in some quarters anyway as
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
burdensome and restrictive and so forth
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
and so on in ways that don't really make
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
sense it's just traditional in some
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
other cases uh it is legal as I talked
 
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
to before so we're that's one of the
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
challenges is what is absolutely needed
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
and what is just traditional or
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
conventional that might be done away
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
with without any harm the customers or
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the purveyors
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
cells we we certainly recognize there's
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for change in in
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
streamlining processes Etc and we're
 
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
certainly not not opposed to that okay
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
but just just we want to reiterate and
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
make everybody recognize
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
how critical the role the certified
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientist is today in terms of
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
assisting state government local
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities and federal governments
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
with the expertise the boots on the
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
ground knowledge to assist and
 
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:19.580 align:start position:0%
facilitate the permitting process
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
removing a certified Wetland science
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
would completely slow down that price I
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe anybody wants to remove
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland scientists from the
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
state's economy and the structure of how
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
we process things we need your expertise
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
does paying a fee to the state increase
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
the value and that's
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
and if it all it does is buy you a stamp
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
sure that it does increase your value
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we're going to find out what's going
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
to happen with the stamps because if
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
your customers are relying on the stamps
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
as confirmation that you are a certified
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientist then we need to to
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
be able to comply with that
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
I would just reiterate too that the the
 
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
I would just reiterate too that the the
stamp

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
stamp
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
isn't we're not just purchasing a stamp
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
to stamp really essentially is
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
certifying that we have the knowledge
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
and the Technical Training the expertise
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be making those decisions
 
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
right there's no question about that
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay it's the we know what it means and
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
then I know you can't go you probably
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
you probably could
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
you can't you shouldn't be able to buy
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
them online because it's just randomly
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
you you have to show that you've got the
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
experience and so I'm going I'm going to
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
ask the oplc how they're going to deal
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
with that issue
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
in representative Lucas
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
yep so uh I think we understand the
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
stamp issue and I mean part of what
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here is find out
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
things like that that might be an issue
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
is there anything else
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
any other problem other than the stamp
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
issue that would be cause to certify
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientists
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
um if the licensing went away that you
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
and and to your point about you know the
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
value and all that I I think the
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
certification is what shows that you've
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
had the training and the competence the
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
not the license
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
so there's nobody's challenging that
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
aspect of it but there may be practice
 
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539 align:start position:0%
or legal things where uh not being
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
licensed might cause a problem the
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
stamps won and that can be dealt with
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
but what else if there is any
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
Karen if I could if you correct me if
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong I think I heard and correct me
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I'm not if I'm mistaken that
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
the issue with the license is you can
 
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
field complaints and revoke a license
 
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
based upon that process is that am I did
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
I hear that correct from this corner yes
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
that is one of the features of a license
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
but like your letter says Wetland
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
scientists have not proven to be a
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
discipline issue in this state at least
 
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:00.380 align:start position:0%
they're generally
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and well-behaved and
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
ethical so follow-up and we would
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with that and reinforce
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
that by saying we have very very few
 
00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:12.490 align:start position:0%
that by saying we have very very few
complaints

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
that we could probably count them on one
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
hand so if there needs to be a process
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
then we can probably get on board with
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
that if it's if it's framed properly and
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't remove
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
our ability to provide the the important
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
services that we provide for landowners
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and all of the other
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are out there so I
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
think there's a way that we can get to
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the licensing issue and the ability
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
based upon complaints that would come in
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to revoke a license and I
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
think and again correct me from Ryan I
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
think I hear that as a very important
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
issue it is and and some some of the the
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
number of complaints per licensee varies
 
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.649 align:start position:0%
number of complaints per licensee varies
tremendously

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
tremendously
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
look Wetland scientists get very few
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
accountants get very few midwives get a
 
00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:04.549 align:start position:0%
accountants get very few midwives get a
lot

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah understood uh
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
both the certified Wetland scientist
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
program and nanners have a very strong
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and it speaks to those
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
very issues if you're not conducting
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
yourself in an ethical manner there are
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
ways that we can deal with that okay
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
excellent representative yeah my
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
follow-up actually was going to ask
 
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:27.500 align:start position:0%
about that if the certification
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
organization process had
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
some way of dealing with alleged
 
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
misbehavior and if it seems Justified
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
revoking the certification or something
 
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:45.730 align:start position:0%
revoking the certification or something
else

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
where's your question again I'm sorry so
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
um you're certified through some
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
certification organization
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
and I think I kind of hardly got an
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
answer the question is does that
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
organization have some way of dealing
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
with a situation where a certified
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientist is alleged to have
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
misbehaved in some manner looking at it
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then potentially revoking the
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
certification or make some other
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
requirement yes through through the
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
natural border through the board of
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
natural scientists there there is a
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism within their rule
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
structure other than the board of
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
natural scientists does your nanners
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
having to have that right not not the
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
state nothing to do with the state of
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just the private
 
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.130 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just the private
organization

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.570 align:start position:0%
organization
yeah

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
yeah understood and again we have a very
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
strong code of ethics that's written
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
into our bylaws and every year we put on
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
training and we just had our annual
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
training and we have a session in our
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
annual training that is specific to
 
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:47.630 align:start position:0%
annual training that is specific to
ethics

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have lawyers come in speak to us go
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
through different scenarios on how we
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
should you know handle ourselves
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
ethically both within the confines of
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
our bylaws as well as other state laws
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
and any other ethical requirements so
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for if you will calling
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
people out onto the carpet and saying by
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
you're conducting yourself what we deem
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
to be unethically and we have options to
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
take take actions to correct that does
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
that help yes very much so
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm thanks Madam
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so I
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
just want to better understand aside
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
from certification
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
is there any other experience or
 
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:31.970 align:start position:0%
is there any other experience or
expertise

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:39.860 align:start position:0%
yes there's there's a
 
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
there is a a significant amount of
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
coursework that is required
 
00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:45.770 align:start position:0%
coursework that is required
um

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
through that's required for the
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
certification correct you know so
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
outside of that certification beyond
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
beyond the certificate beyond the
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
certification you're required to have a
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
two years of experience uh coursework
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
um in soils and the Natural Sciences
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
biology there are a number of qualifiers
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
the process for becoming certif
 
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.370 align:start position:0%
the process for becoming certif
certified

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.210 align:start position:0%
certified
um

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
isn't as is cumbersome as some might
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
might say and it's certainly not a
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
um an impediment to
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
entry into the workforce
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I can say I work for a private
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
consulting firm uh in Portsmouth and we
 
00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:31.970 align:start position:0%
consulting firm uh in Portsmouth and we
recently

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.990 align:start position:0%
recently
um

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
put an ad out for a new a position entry
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
level position we we received 15 resumes
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh 75 percent of the those new
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
candidates straight out of Plymouth
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
State and UNH all had the the the core
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
coursework to become a certified Wetland
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
scientist they lacked the two years of
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
experience but um they certainly have a
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
lot of potential and like I said we've
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
we've just hired two two new staff
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
members this week
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
follow up Madam chair follow-up please
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
is is the two years of experience is
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
that required for certification or just
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
for licensure in the state of New
 
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.049 align:start position:0%
for licensure in the state of New
Hampshire

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
certification and and to receive that
 
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.370 align:start position:0%
certification and and to receive that
license

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
do you need that you need two years of
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
experience yes but in order to be
 
00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
experience yes but in order to be
certified

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
you don't need the two years experience
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
they're I'm still I'm I apologize I'm
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
still struggling with it with
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
certification versus the licensure I
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
still I look at them as as one of the
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
same as a certified well and scientists
 
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.769 align:start position:0%
same as a certified well and scientists
um

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
um is is a license and and it shows that
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
you that you are certified you're
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
certified to have your certifies and
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that you have the science
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
the background the expertise to to
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
determine and draw the line between
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
Uplands and wetlands those those lands
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
that are developable and those that are
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
those that are not as well as assess
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
those wetlands
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
um to assist in in determining their
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
true function their true functions and
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
values to assist with the permitting
 
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.450 align:start position:0%
values to assist with the permitting
process

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative black as yeah maybe I
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
can make an attempt at uh I mean we're
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about that distinction and so
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
the they are different so the
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
certification is um what this private
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
organization provides after you've met
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
whatever their requirements are and that
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the state of New
 
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.269 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the state of New
Hampshire

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
licensing is something the state of New
 
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
and it has a set of requirements that
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
that Beyond certification that you have
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
to do and I think what we're trying to
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
understand is
 
00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:53.090 align:start position:0%
understand is
um

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.890 align:start position:0%
um
one

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
what requirements does it take to get
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
the license Beyond certification
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
I assume there's a fee representative
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
the the statute is talking about
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
certification rather than licensing
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
which is probably part of the confusion
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
yes however it says that the
 
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.110 align:start position:0%
yes however it says that the
um

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
that someone
 
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
that someone
right

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
I think basically it says that if you
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
you'll get a
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
a a license
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
and their specific and I the specific
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
requirements for certification are
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
listed in the statute and I believe that
 
00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:42.769 align:start position:0%
listed in the statute and I believe that
the

00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
okay any person who's passed the
 
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
examination or otherwise qualified as a
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland scientist shall upon
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
payment of fee be issued a certificate
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
okay the problem is here that the terms
 
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
are used synonymously yes that is the
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
problem and I and I apologize if no no
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's confused either yeah that is the
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
problem and so that is part of the
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
problem there are two of the same and
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
you go through the certification process
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
you you become certified
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
and and at that same time you receive
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
the license as well right
 
00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
the license as well right
um

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
I believe that it doesn't look like
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
there is any requirement other than
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
paying the fee of course
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
that differentiates the license from the
 
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.350 align:start position:0%
that differentiates the license from the
certificate

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:33.260 align:start position:0%
at least I can't find any in the statute
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
I think again that they're the same the
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
license in the in the certificate are
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
issued simultaneously
 
00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:49.210 align:start position:0%
issued simultaneously
um

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:49.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
thank you that's the license
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that you've completed the
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
coursework and the training
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
and the tests provided by the by the
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
board to demonstrate that that you are
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
competent and you have that knowledge if
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
I could do a follow-up I'm still a
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
little please
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we should use the term uh private
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
certification state certification if the
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
state's using the term certification to
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
differentiate it but
 
00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
differentiate it but
so

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
to get the private certification
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
do you have to complete the coursework
 
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:22.340 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
okay yes all right so yes you do what
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
the chair said read
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that you have to to
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
get the state certification or license
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it you you
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
first have to get the private
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
certification so they're not one in the
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
same is that incorrect that's incorrect
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
there there is no privacy no private
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
certification there's just one one
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
single mechanism to become a certified
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientist at that time you also
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
receive a license they are two two of
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
the same so there's no there's no
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
there's no separate
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
organization that issues simply a
 
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.870 align:start position:0%
organization that issues simply a
certification

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.549 align:start position:0%
certification
to

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:08.690 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
to practice Wetland science follow-up
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up so are you receiving
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
so you receive the certification from
 
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
the state not from the organization
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's providing the training and all
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
that that's correct it's not provided
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
it's not the certification is not
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
provided by our by our organization
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
um our organization does
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
work uh close closely with government
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
agencies to ensure that we're providing
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
adequate training at our seminars so
 
00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:41.539 align:start position:0%
that we can as scientists each biennium
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that we have the sufficient
 
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
coursework in professional development
 
00:31:50.529 --> 00:31:50.539 align:start position:0%
some of which includes
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
ethical ethics training two two credit
 
00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:56.419 align:start position:0%
two credits
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
earlier there was a mention that
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe I misunderstood but I thought
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
the private organization
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
um could take some action against
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
somebody who was not following those
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
ethics or or other things and how does
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
that work I think Paul says the
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
president of nainers can speak better to
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
that but but as as a as a board we also
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
have a code of ethics and but there is a
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
mechanism to just to clarify which board
 
00:32:23.529 --> 00:32:23.539 align:start position:0%
you mean
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
or the private organization I use the
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
wrong term not bored as an as um as an
 
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:33.260 align:start position:0%
association we have the ability to
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
to recognize any instances when there
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be an unethical uh an Ethics
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
violation of sorts to to remove
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
a person or member of the association
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
but that is not directly tied to their
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
certification or
 
00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:55.580 align:start position:0%
slash license
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
they'd be removed from membership in the
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
organization is what would happen
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
all right well that's very interesting
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
so uh one of the things that clearly has
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
to be considered is whether the net
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
benefit of the the retaining the current
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
structure which seems to be functioning
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
excellently well it's a simple uh
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
relatively simple uh Arrangement and it
 
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
relatively simple uh Arrangement and it
works

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
and we are talking about some
 
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:34.100 align:start position:0%
slightly different
 
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.649 align:start position:0%
slightly different
process

00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:35.659 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
where the license might go away
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
and the question is whether it's worth
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
the trouble of creating this new
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
condition situation of vis-a-vis what it
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
currently exists and I mean there there
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
are some other professions for example
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
nurses are called registered nurses but
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
that registration is still effectively a
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
licensed certified public accountant
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's they are basically licensed even
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
though though they're called certified
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
public accountant so what's up do you
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
guys have similar to our situation right
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's that that sounds very similar to
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
our situation here right yeah right so
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
that that's what we're wrestling with
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
whether the process that we're looking
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
at here is worth the trouble to try to
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
create a new situation and and save the
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
license fee or whatever
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
I think at the end of the day you know
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's it's important to recognize the
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
laws and rules that require the use of
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
the science are not are not going away
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
they'll still be there
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
very important to recommend just to
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
remember that the certified well and
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
Sciences today really helped facilitate
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
that process through the permitting and
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
and it there's there's absolutely no
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
doubt about that by removing survey well
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
scientists it would it would have an
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
adverse or have the opposite effect of
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
what yeah you folks may be trying to
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
achieve the question is not removing
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
certified Wetland Sciences saying
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
whether the state should be
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
issuing the certificate rather than your
 
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.329 align:start position:0%
issuing the certificate rather than your
organization

00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
and that's something that
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
um apparently the certification
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
requirements in statute are the same as
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
your Professional Organization there's
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
no additional requirement for the state
 
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.790 align:start position:0%
no additional requirement for the state
license

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
is that how much value is added by that
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
I see so thank you very much I really
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate the information you've raised
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
great thank you for your time yeah no
 
00:35:52.079 --> 00:36:00.890 align:start position:0%
great thank you for your time yeah no
it's

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
and contact information okay thank you
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
very much we will appreciate that
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
because we might have more questions
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
for you specifically but I think it's
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
more for What would
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
what was the intention of this change in
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
regard to Wetland scientists you will
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
notice on the letter we do have a
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
legislative committee within manners our
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
organization Kimberly Pease is the chair
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
of that she apologizes she had family
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
commitments couldn't be here today but
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
she will be dealing with this as it
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
moves forward as our legislative chair
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
so that's home excellent take these
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
legislative changes okay you know I
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't don't doubt it all right and thank
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time and uh thank
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
you for hearing us great thank you
 
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.970 align:start position:0%
you for hearing us great thank you
[Music]

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I think the questions we had
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
regarding stamps and licenses and so
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
forth is pretty much the same for
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
soil scientists
 
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:08.810 align:start position:0%
soil scientists
um

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.849 align:start position:0%
 
Foresters

00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
Foresters
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
and Landscape Architects so if you you
 
00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:15.170 align:start position:0%
and Landscape Architects so if you you
could

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:18.619 align:start position:0%
address those though
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:48.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to comment that the
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
governor's talk about Wetland about
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects needing a license
 
00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:57.980 align:start position:0%
to plant a rose bush is actually
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
incorrect there are specific exemptions
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them and the only time you
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
need a license as far as I can tell is
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
when your customer for example the
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
federal government Demands a stamp
 
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.170 align:start position:0%
federal government Demands a stamp
document

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
and that's how do they get the stamps
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's one question we have for you good
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Douglas osterhau I am
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the office of
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here this
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
morning my understanding and I'm going
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
to confirm this I have it written down
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
as an action item because I want to
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
confirm this with executive director
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
Courtney who unfortunately couldn't be
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is to get away from
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
Individual board stamps and create one
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
oplc stamp that would say any of these
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
boards any of these certifications
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
licenses that need a stamp have sort of
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
the writ of approval if you will
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
um So the plan is that you're going to
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
develop a
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
a stamp
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
that you can
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
provide to any of these professions that
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this situation is
 
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
that right now there are individual
 
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
stamps that do exist and that's a long
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
term so if a stamp is in rule right now
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
you probably have the physical stamp in
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
the office I've seen them yesterday they
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
are long term would be remove all the
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
different individual stamps
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
streamline that get it down to one but
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
how that's nice to know but the real
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
question is how do you decide who do you
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
give them to
 
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.370 align:start position:0%
give them to
because

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
if you're requiring
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
if a wetland scientist for example is
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
required to have a stamp to submit plans
 
00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:52.970 align:start position:0%
required to have a stamp to submit plans
to

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
a town or even an individual landowner
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
how do you decide who is an appropriate
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
person to have such a stamp
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to be licensed or
 
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:08.660 align:start position:0%
registered or otherwise
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
communicating with your office that's
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
the whole heart of the issue as far as
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned sure so
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
I mean right now if if you meet the
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
standards whatever the standards are in
 
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
law or rule sorry representative
 
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.950 align:start position:0%
law or rule sorry representative
um

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
yes so yeah right right and so getting
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
where the licensure doesn't necessarily
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
mean we get rid of the certification or
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to identify individuals who
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
are certified I think one thing that so
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on the process for the
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
Wetland soils but my understanding is
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
that the certification is actually a
 
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.750 align:start position:0%
that the certification is actually a
national

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
certification it well it's also
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
reflected in our statute and the license
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
would give you the ability to work in
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
you are issued the license when you
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
receive the certification but if you
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
still have that certification and you
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
still need that stamp
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a process we we can still
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
have that list of people 300 identified
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
and I can also run this by executive
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
director Courtney to get and we're going
 
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to see that because
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
we do need the authority to we need
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
somebody to have the authority to
 
00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:31.609 align:start position:0%
somebody to have the authority to
discipline

00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
misbehaving Wetland scientists whether
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's their organization or or our
 
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.530 align:start position:0%
it's their organization or or our
organization

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
but that's needed even if it doesn't
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
come up very often
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the professionals need a way that
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
they can identify themselves and
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
classically that's been a stamp which is
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
and so therefore they need a way to get
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Adams certified Wetland scientist
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
that they can they can use
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and the question is does the
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
license it doesn't seem to have any
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
requirement in addition to their
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
professional certification which are
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
listed in statute
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
so what if the only value is that you're
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:25.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
can you help
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
of I'm not understanding the question
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well if you're going to still
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
need to track who is a certified Wetland
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
scientist so that you can provide the
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
stamp that they need to have their
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
results accepted
 
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.490 align:start position:0%
results accepted
um

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by eliminating the
 
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by eliminating the
license

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
it seems like you can't unless you're
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
going to totally do something different
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative black issue maybe you can
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
help him understand right
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
um so first of all this may have been
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
done due to a misunderstanding on my
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
part or someone else's we just heard
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh the private organization
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
that provides the training and all that
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
does not do certification yet you seem
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
to imply that they do so
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
I've got the names of some organizations
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
in my folder I'm reaching for them okay
 
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.490 align:start position:0%
in my folder I'm reaching for them okay
um

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
and and then the follow-up assuming they
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
do offer certification or something like
 
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
it whatever they call it
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
um we heard there seems to be some kind
 
00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.290 align:start position:0%
um we heard there seems to be some kind
of

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know they can have a disciplinary
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
process and if they're not happy with if
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
they think someone's misbehaved they can
 
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
you know exclude them from the
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
organization the question is if they're
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
providing a certification does that then
 
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.750 align:start position:0%
providing a certification does that then
mean

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
that um that certification would be
 
00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:06.849 align:start position:0%
that um that certification would be
revoked

00:44:06.849 --> 00:44:06.859 align:start position:0%
revoked
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
and then the question then would be
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know how would uh
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
how would somebody who's going to employ
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
them know that's happened unless you
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
know I guess it'd be fraud if they said
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
they had certification but then but
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
I've written now that as an action item
 
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.099 align:start position:0%
to research that question I think we
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
just heard in testimony that a
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
professional association can take action
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
against a certification
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
but we've also heard that they don't do
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
certification but that may have been due
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
to confusion so what I appreciate my
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is that for professional
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientists there is the PWS
 
00:44:45.609 --> 00:44:45.619 align:start position:0%
certification which is a national
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
certification board
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's not a certification coming from
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
we issue the license but the
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
certification comes from a national
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
accrediting agency
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay and and follow up follow up this is
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh kind of the second part you said
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it's my misunderstand but you said
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
that all these stamps would be combined
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
to one I assume
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
you're not literally meaning that
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
because I assume you'd have to have a
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
stamp that indicated what they were the
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
Wetland science or soil scientists or
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
professional engineer whatever is that
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
correct or
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
I mean was it one Authority that would
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
Grant these stamps or you really mean
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
one stamp that's the same
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.099 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
I think again this is if you don't know
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
you'll come back well my understanding
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
is that it's essentially that one stamp
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
would mean you met the criteria that
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
would have gotten you the other stamp
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
but it just but what criteria that's
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
because there's different criteria for
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
different professions right yeah you'd
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to have a one one for
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
soil scientists a wetland scientists and
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects well those would be
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
established in law would be established
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
in Rule and all the one stamp would say
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
is that you met whatever those standards
 
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
established in law and Rule would be and
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
again this is something that we need to
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
we need more information for deciding
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:20.089 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
in the search for simplifying the state
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
government we do not want to get these
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
people out of
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
unable to work because we as we need
 
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.410 align:start position:0%
unable to work because we as we need
them

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
I and I think that the other uh
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
technical professions soil scientists
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
and probably Professional Engineers and
 
00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:47.900 align:start position:0%
Architects are the same way that the
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
requirements in statute are basically
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
meet your professional organizations
 
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.089 align:start position:0%
meet your professional organizations
requirements

00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:46:59.410 --> 00:46:59.420 align:start position:0%
and then and then deal with the state
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
it certainly looks that way for
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
I hope hope we can meet again and have
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
director Courtney here who might well
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
we'd also like to see the exact wording
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
of what how they're what's happening and
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmidt
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
one of the problems I have I I wish I
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
alluded to a little bit earlier is
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
whether we we're going to disrupt this
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
currently functioning situation
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
um whether the you know the
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
pain that is going to be caused to some
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
degree is worth the benefit of getting
 
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:47.540 align:start position:0%
because to me it seems like there are
 
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:52.819 align:start position:0%
three stages of of
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
involvement if you will one is the
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
lowest level is registration where you
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
just come in and you say I'm X
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
no examination is involved no high level
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
of in some cases no high level of
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
training is involved but uh you know you
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
want to have a handle on these people
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
and we had this a couple of years ago
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
when uh when we had the case at Exeter
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
Hospital of this individual who came in
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
from out of state
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
he was a medical technician okay turns
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
out he was diverting drugs
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
his own use he wound up infecting and
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately killing several people many
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
more were infected
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to register these people
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it was kind of like
 
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
the state was had a gigantic kick me
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
sign on it
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
um that meant these people could come in
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
and nobody was tracking him nobody was
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
registering them nobody had any ideas so
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
we created a registration for a certain
 
00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
group of people who were handling drugs
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
the janitors and so forth they were
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
exempting they weren't involved
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
next higher level is certification which
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
says you had this training you've
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrated competence you have the
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
certifications which says you know how
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
to do this that's what it was
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
the next higher level is you have the
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
certification already but the license
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
says you can legally do it in the state
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the benefit of the
 
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:29.180 align:start position:0%
license is that it gives you the
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
oversight and the control of the
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners because if somebody is out
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
of line either because they
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
they're technically you know incapable
 
00:49:43.329 --> 00:49:43.339 align:start position:0%
incapable or incompetent or they're
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
they're morally moral turpitude which
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
has its own uh negative aspects in terms
 
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
of that categorization but also somebody
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
who was maybe has drug issues
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
or alcohol issues in other words they
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
they have all the skills and so forth so
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
they've got this other problem you know
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh they're they're criminal in in some
 
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
other respects or not suitable in other
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
respects and and so forth but the idea
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
with certification is once somebody can
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
do something and they have a certificate
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
says that they can do it you can't
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
really you can take the certification
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
away but they still know how to do it
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
right they still know all these things
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
and now you've taken away the thing that
 
00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
says that they know how to do it that's
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
a kind of a how many angels on the head
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
of a pin in the way yes representative
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
the question becomes how do we deal with
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
this situation do you gentlemen where
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
you don't seem to have many problems
 
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
with people
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
um and so the certification is kind of
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
all you really need the license doesn't
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
really add anything
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
because you don't need control or
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
oversight Maybe
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
but we're still tinkering with an
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
existing structure who knows and and I
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
think we still have
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
I know some steps to go to make sure
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
that we oh get getting it we absolutely
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to find whether it's worth the
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
trouble we're talking about Crossing and
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
also whether it's it's worth the trouble
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
for them to get the license but and
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
that's going to depend on the details
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.349 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that the
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
there don't appear to be any people on
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
this list that are medical
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
that are medical licenses that will be
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
practicing individually which is the one
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
of the points we have is that it for
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
most medical professions you cannot
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
independently Bill Insurance especially
 
00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:01.490 align:start position:0%
independently Bill Insurance especially
Medicaid

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
for your services unless you have a
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
license and that but these people
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
are are primarily non-medical and the
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
medical licenses are people that are
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
going to be working for somebody else
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay so that then I if we're going to
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
talk about that particular aspect uh it
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
seems to me like there are some people
 
00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:32.900 align:start position:0%
on uh the the list
 
00:52:37.329 --> 00:52:37.339 align:start position:0%
that uh where it's a medical profession
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
where the safe health and safety of the
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
of the public is potentially in play
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
for example limited x-ray machine
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
operator licensed nursing assistant
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
but again those are people that are will
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
be working for
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
for doctors for hospitals for clinics
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the doctor the hospital or the
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
clinic is licensed and is responsible
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
way their their employees work
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
I I've heard that you know at that
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
aspect how about in in number eight in
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
repeal boards Medical Imaging and
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
radiation therapist Advisory Board this
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
is something where uh the it does
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
involve the health and safety of the of
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
the we haven't gotten to the boards
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about the individual
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
licenses okay well and and I and
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
the these I mean you're not going to
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
have some someone who's a radio a uh
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
a limited x-ray machine operator opening
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
their x-rays R Us shop on Main Street
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
which is what they need which is what is
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
needed for a specific
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
um what you need a license for I I agree
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
with you it doesn't seem likely but the
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
thing is there are lots of unresolved
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
issues that that fit in here and so
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay and I can see that you I can see
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
that you are laboring with uh the
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
complexity and the totality of this
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
issue in which there are multiple I yeah
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
I understand it's like the Tower of
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
blocks you can pull out this one but you
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
can't pull out that one the
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
um I understand from
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
other sources that the oplc section of
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 is 300 pages
 
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.549 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 is 300 pages
and

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes so so this one we've got the
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
question of assuming that you know fine
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
you don't have the license how do you
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
the question is how are they going to
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
deal with the question of providing
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
stamps and discipline even though
 
00:54:59.809 --> 00:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
discipline for
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
Wetland scientists soil scientists and
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
so forth is rare I'm sure it still
 
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.309 align:start position:0%
so forth is rare I'm sure it still
happens

00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
we have data that shows how rare but
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
still does not somebody's got to do it
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
and how and how do we make sure that it
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
when it is needed it happens
 
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.210 align:start position:0%
when it is needed it happens
so

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can specifically say
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're we're in support of the of of
 
00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
repealed unless we know how these
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
particular issues are being settled
 
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.329 align:start position:0%
particular issues are being settled
okay

00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
all right gold that's
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
any other useful information no thank
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
you you're just getting the action items
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
all right uh going on to some of the
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
um Universal license recognition
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
I believe we've included that in the
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
separate bill I think it was
 
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.049 align:start position:0%
separate bill I think it was
um

00:56:08.049 --> 00:56:08.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
I don't remember
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
we had a bill that dealt with that we
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
passed it
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
all right the clear lines between the
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
fact finding and adjudicive hearings the
 
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
investatory hearings process and all
 
00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:39.950 align:start position:0%
investatory hearings process and all
that

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
that is something that we are working on
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 655 and I'd rather warrant
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
you you run the possibility of changing
 
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.109 align:start position:0%
you you run the possibility of changing
one

00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
of synchronizing the two facts that
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
needs to be in 655 and the subcommittee
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
is has at least one more meeting on that
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
so I I think we want to say that take we
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't want that
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
if I could comment on that I yeah I mean
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
I don't know what these two or three
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
hundred pages are going to be but I mean
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
if it completely rewrites all of the
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
licensing there may be problems with
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
references in 655 that point to things
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
that don't exist
 
00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.490 align:start position:0%
that don't exist
so

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
or any other Bill we've in any other
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it's going to be yes it's going
 
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
to be a challenge for everybody to keep
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
track of who's doing what to whom and I
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that we do as
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
much as we can to eliminate duplication
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt okay well I I
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
have one other problem a problem with
 
00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
this whole situation in which you I
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
think slightly alluded to and that is
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is being put in House
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
Bill too uh yeah I I think this is a an
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
issue which deserves to be stand or fall
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
on its own because putting it in the
 
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.809 align:start position:0%
on its own because putting it in the
budget

00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know it it gives it uh it it burdens
 
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:17.300 align:start position:0%
the budget process and the budget itself
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
with uh an element of risk or
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and so forth which the
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
budget doesn't need it's got enough
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
problems on its own and enough gravity
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
on its own that it should stand and fall
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
on its own uh and putting and and
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
putting this thing in there just adds an
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
element of of of of risk as I say that I
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
think is uh is unwise we we should it
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
this issue should be dealt with
 
00:58:45.299 --> 00:58:49.430 align:start position:0%
this issue should be dealt with
separately

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
major reorganizations
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
generally appear in the budget because
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
they don't actually happen unless the
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
governor approves of them
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
and is willing to push them so
 
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:07.700 align:start position:0%
I would agree with you I uh
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
somewhat in that since we already have a
 
00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:11.530 align:start position:0%
somewhat in that since we already have a
bill

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:11.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
655 that reorganizes oplc fairly
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
exhaustively we want to make sure
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in House Bill 2 that
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so looking at these over this
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
overview there all the
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
going down to uh the last two bullets
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
most of the rest of that ought to be in
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
655 rather than house built it
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I agree with you we don't want to
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
put the
 
00:59:43.319 --> 00:59:51.770 align:start position:0%
put the
um

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
we don't want to burden the budget with
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
the this reorganization that we're
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
already dealing with in a different Bill
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
and having
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
two different bills we'd have to keep
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
track of and and know which one takes
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
precedence is a major effort that
 
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to have to do
 
01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.270 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to have to do
um

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
but I think most of these issues
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
until you get to the licenses and so
 
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.710 align:start position:0%
until you get to the licenses and so
forth

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
the last two bullets are already in 655
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
and are already being dealt with and our
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation to finances take them out
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
of house bill too
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
I definitely would it I agree that that
 
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
putting this in the budget I think is
 
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
putting this in the budget I think is
just

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
that you're you're saying can you do
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
this and and also juggle the uh 15 balls
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time and you're going like
 
01:00:59.530 --> 01:00:59.540 align:start position:0%
why would you want to try to do both
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
simultaneously it's just there's no
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
benefit to it that I can see
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of risk okay
 
01:01:08.819 --> 01:01:10.250 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of risk okay
um

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.430 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
the moving the move to oplc from the
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
and the board of Licensing for
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
interpreters for the deaf deaf blind and
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
hard of hearing
 
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.710 align:start position:0%
hard of hearing
um

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
those are all
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
let's see the board of auctioneers and
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
the interpreters for deaf deafblind and
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
so forth we we deal with the structure
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
of those boards they're fairly similar
 
01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:46.370 align:start position:0%
of those boards they're fairly similar
to

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
what we have for the other professional
 
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.030 align:start position:0%
what we have for the other professional
boards

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.030 align:start position:0%
boards
and

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see why they you know just
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
moving them can't be done in House Bill
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
too that's a fairly normal thing to
 
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.789 align:start position:0%
too that's a fairly normal thing to
happen

01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:02:01.799 --> 01:02:02.690 align:start position:0%
happen
um

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
you just want to make sure that there's
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
the something like the existing licenses
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
will will be continue the existing rules
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
will continue
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to disrupt the
 
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
auctioneers or the interpreters either
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
way you want to have carry the
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure along with them
 
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.569 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure along with them
um

01:02:28.569 --> 01:02:28.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling is not actually a
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
professional board the license I believe
 
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
referees for things like these days it's
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
mostly mixed martial arts
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.370 align:start position:0%
and it's
um

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
we've occasionally had a dealing about
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
it but it's not a professional board by
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
any means
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
and I don't know anything about the
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
all right let's
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
we don't know anything about those guys
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
the auctioneers and and deaf
 
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
the auctioneers and and deaf
interpreters

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
interpreters
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see any reason why they can't be
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
moved and
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
with with with
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
reasonable accuracy
 
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:47.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.010 align:start position:0%
 
does

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
the advisor the changes to advisory
 
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.410 align:start position:0%
the advisor the changes to advisory
boards

01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
we did some of that last session
 
01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:01.730 align:start position:0%
we did some of that last session
and

01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
it all depends on how you do it it's not
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
as simple as it looks
 
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.329 align:start position:0%
as simple as it looks
um

01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we would what we could
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any ideas of what we
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
could do about
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
converting those to
 
01:04:32.329 --> 01:04:32.339 align:start position:0%
the the intent to make those advisory
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
boards representative like us and the
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
one I have some familiarity with is
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
working with the acupuncturists in the
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
past is uh I think this could work I
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
don't see a problem with it for them the
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
other is I don't know that much about
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:54.980 align:start position:0%
oh which one
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
the nursing home administrators is
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
again it's a small number of their
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
professionals I think there's only a
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
couple hundred of them right and I think
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
one of the uh
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
the director Courtney has said in the
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
past one of the problems with the ones
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
that have very few I think the one that
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
was talking about the time was the
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
Midwife free council is if they actually
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
have authority as opposed to be an
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
advisory that can pose a
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
Federal Anti-Trust issue and that I
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
think one of the Carolinas actually lost
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
a case related to that recently yeah
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay well that's
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
but it but again we can't really say go
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
for it until we see the details because
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.150 align:start position:0%
it's been
um

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
even even if we agree with the concept
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
well I I think that's true for all you
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
need to look over again the same with
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
the merged boards we need to see the
 
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
before we say go ahead or don't go ahead
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
right and there may be
 
01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.650 align:start position:0%
right and there may be
um

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:05.579 align:start position:0%
issues that I mean hopefully been
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
considered but may not have like maybe
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
the stamp issue was considered maybe not
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know and who knows what else
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
there might be in some of these well
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're combining the land surveyors
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
with the Professional Engineers
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't see why they shouldn't also
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
if we need to include the boards for
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects Wetland scientists
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
and natural scientists because all those
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
professional groups are very similar in
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
that you get the the Technical Training
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
and then you apply for the license and
 
01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:39.299 align:start position:0%
get a stamp and the amount of disa
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues that come up is very
 
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.549 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues that come up is very
low

01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:06:43.559 --> 01:06:44.589 align:start position:0%
low
um

01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:46.210 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:46.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
one Tech One Professional board rather
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
four or five of them it might make
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
things a little easier
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
right we need to look at at the details
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
I mean the question is is the dis
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
investigation disciplinary going to be
 
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:03.260 align:start position:0%
handled by the certification
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
organizations or by oplc or I don't know
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
what the plan is yep definitely need the
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
details to do anything on those
 
01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:20.329 align:start position:0%
details to do anything on those
um

01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.339 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
and all the rest of them you know we
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
gotta we've got to look at the details
 
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:37.970 align:start position:0%
gotta we've got to look at the details
um

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.849 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
I don't is there anybody that has
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
something that it'd be useful to talk
 
01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:48.589 align:start position:0%
something that it'd be useful to talk
about

01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
I have another action item for old PLC
 
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.069 align:start position:0%
I have another action item for old PLC
though

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh when do the licenses that are
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
repealed going to expire
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
and are you going to be issuing refunds
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
if they retire if they expire before the
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
I mean somebody who apply who gets a
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
license the week before you uh repeal
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
the need for it is going to feel very
 
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:26.090 align:start position:0%
the need for it is going to feel very
silly

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you have a
 
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you have a
comment

01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
so representative Dan Maguire
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
representing Epsom I'm on the house
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
finance committee division one which is
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
this area that we're you know almost
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
anything from Edna will go to my
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
division if it's related to finance
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to step back and take a
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture of why we're
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
sitting here today talking about these
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
things and it has to do with
 
01:09:13.809 --> 01:09:13.819 align:start position:0%
the overall budget process
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
the governor is someone who's clearly
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the legislative process more
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
important than any single legislator or
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
or body in the sense that he has the
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
veto over anything we do right so so
 
01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:33.620 align:start position:0%
he's he's effectively the most important
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
legislator in that sense
 
01:09:36.179 --> 01:09:37.550 align:start position:0%
legislator in that sense
but

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
the governors
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill so so that's that's a negative
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's not a positive but but via the
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
budget process we have handed to the
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
governor a positive which is the
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
governor creates the first draft of
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1 and House Bill 2. House
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 is General legislation and so
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
this is the one time per year per
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
session that the governor gets to write
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
legislation right and create it and I
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
don't think that this organization of
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
the budget process is const is specified
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution it's effectively an
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
extra power that we've given by setting
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
up the process this way and it doesn't
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be that way right I
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
mean the the agencies it could come
 
01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
straight to the finance committee and
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
write the budget that way and the
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
governor could be not involved in the
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
budget process for example so
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I think that's something that this
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
committee might think about whether
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
putting this sort of General legislative
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
creation power in the governor's hands
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
is appropriate I mean it it's
 
01:10:58.679 --> 01:11:00.169 align:start position:0%
is appropriate I mean it it's
um

01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's easy to see why he
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
wants to do it and especially in this
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
case because our state is hurting for
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
employees right I mean the the real
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
reason this all this stuff is in
 
01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:18.500 align:start position:0%
legislation is because of the general
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
lack of employees in the state right and
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
so one of those has to do with licensing
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
is a is a barrier to employment and so
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
the governor obviously and we all have
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
an incentive to reduce those employment
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
barriers so it's this is well the
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
motivation is there but I'm not sure the
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
way the process is going
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
um makes sense I think yes thank you I
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
agree and that's why I say that we've
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
already got the re restructuring of the
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
oplc and many of these issues in a
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
separate bill
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature which is 655
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
and we would recommend those not be in
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:12:10.679 --> 01:12:12.130 align:start position:0%
the budget
because

01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:12.140 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:15.380 align:start position:0%
they're not needed there
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
and and also it's we're already working
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
on it you know glad to know the governor
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
supports the idea we're expecting his
 
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.490 align:start position:0%
supports the idea we're expecting his
signature

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
signature
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be in the budget
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm thinking is it
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be a tragedy if all
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
this kind of stuff became a bill next
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
year and was not part of the budget
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
right I mean it
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
if if it's too complicated right I mean
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
if all these things look very reasonable
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
and we should go ahead with it and the
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
sooner the better right the sooner we
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
can reduce barriers to employment
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
obviously the better but if it's super
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
complicated and there's a lot of details
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
in every little piece
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better as a bill next year
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
rather than a budget this year Well
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
having seen many of these
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh items before
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
I mean this there's a lot in here that
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
we've seen seen already
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
we've already identified issues with the
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
technical boards that have to be solved
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
before we go any further
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
the booth license is already in another
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
bill that we're dealing with in
 
01:13:28.199 --> 01:13:29.450 align:start position:0%
bill that we're dealing with in
committee

01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh athlete agents
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
we've tried to delete several times and
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
have not been able to pass
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
um same with Hawkers and Peddlers and
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendors we've repealed those
 
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
last session while we didn't repeal them
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
we tried to pass the house failed in the
 
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.950 align:start position:0%
we tried to pass the house failed in the
Senate

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.209 align:start position:0%
Senate
um

01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
the medical technicians
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
again we've tried to repeal that license
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
but failed
 
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.790 align:start position:0%
but failed
um

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's as
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
unless the government
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think these are as simple
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
as the governor seems to think I mean he
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
certainly mistaken the
 
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.910 align:start position:0%
certainly mistaken the
um

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
and mischaracterize what the license is
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
needed for
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
because we've already Exempted plant you
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
know gardeners landscapers Etc you're
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
only needed for making plans when the
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
customer Demands a stamp
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
basically federally funded Highway
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
projects and possibly if they're redoing
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
they have a they have a grading problem
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
at the prison in Berlin
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
other than that you don't need a license
 
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.310 align:start position:0%
other than that you don't need a license
so

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yep couple things
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.270 align:start position:0%
one is
um

01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we're kind of
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
at Sea here because we don't have
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
details and
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
questions do you have any idea when we
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
might see the actual language because if
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is very similar to the 655
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's great and then we can look at the
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
other separate pieces
 
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:19.940 align:start position:0%
and that might not be a huge deal
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
however if it's being done very
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
differently than 655
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's a different challenge I mean I I
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
do in principle I think support what the
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
governor is trying to do and we do in my
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
view have an issue in New Hampshire that
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
we license a lot more professions than
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
almost any other state in the Union
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
which I see is a bad thing
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
but the question is how to go about
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're expecting house bill to
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
the end of this week that's what I've
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's um we'll have we'll have
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
to look at it because in most of these
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
cases it depends on how it's implemented
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
I mean I had a bill to delete the
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
licensing for medical technicians which
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
is which is purely a registration no
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
skill required no nothing just you know
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
give us your name and address and pay
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
the feed you've got a certificate and
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
you've got a registration
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
because they're employers to take care
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
of most of the work of of determining
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
who's qualified and and and discipline
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
or they should
 
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.310 align:start position:0%
or they should
but

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
again that
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
that was fought in the house on the
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
and it and lost on the basis of one
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
bad actor and I certainly can't give any
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
anybody any Assurance there won't ever
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
be another bad actor
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
but in the athlete agents was you know
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
recommended to be the sponsor of the
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
bill repealing the need for the
 
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.590 align:start position:0%
bill repealing the need for the
registration

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.110 align:start position:0%
registration
recommended

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
killing the bill was it three years ago
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
four years ago something like that
 
01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
he came in with the repeal we don't need
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
this and then he said well after a
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
couple of hearings and talking about it
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
what does we don't know what the um
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
professional organizations are doing
 
01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
and they were changing their rules at
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.570 align:start position:0%
the time
so

01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you well there are several aspects
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
to uh that I want to discuss at this
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
point number one is I think that the the
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the process has one
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
pretty important flaw and that is where
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of us
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be a full committee
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
work session but unfortunately most of
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
the people are either out of town or on
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
vacation so that's kind of like having a
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
football team football game where you
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
only have three of the players on one of
 
01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it was more important that we start
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
in on this and look for some of the
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
zingers like the stamps I'm not
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
criticizing you madam chair I really am
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
not because you're trying to deal with
 
01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:26.270 align:start position:0%
not because you're trying to deal with
the

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
the issues that come before this
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
Committee in a way but but the net
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
effect that in nevertheless is that we
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
are missing people who are all going to
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to vote either yay or nay
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
um so uh that is a fact that we need to
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of then one of the things
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Dan McGuire was
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
talking about is how we are suffering in
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from a dearth of workers
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
in all across the board
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
that is true are we unique among states
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
in this in this in this aspect and I
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
suggest that we are not this is a uni
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a general malaise that that we
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
are facing in the country because uh
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh we well I don't have to go into it
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
we're all aware of it
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
um but it is a reality so that to the
 
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
way that we are trying to fix something
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that is is not is not
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
unique to New Hampshire we're kidding
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
ourselves if we think we're going to
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
attract all the missing workers here
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to any other state
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
especially when we have weather like
 
01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.250 align:start position:0%
especially when we have weather like
this

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
um but anyway I'm here too uh so but
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
another aspect is to the the degree we
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
put it in the budget even though it's a
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
good vehicle
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
um in some respects it also is a a
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
political instrument with regard to
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
aspects that that are going to
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
potentially uh sink the budget
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know that yet because we
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
um so uh and and then the other aspect
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
is that anything having to do with the
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the citizens of New
 
01:20:18.179 --> 01:20:19.850 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the citizens of New
Hampshire

01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh and a number of these do uh is
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
problematical and needs to be deal dealt
 
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
with separately in my view so I'm
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
willing to continue but but we are
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
missing some of the key players in that
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
regard as well director Courtney is with
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
all due respect to Mr ostrad uh is uh is
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
a key player here
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and there are also some other people
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
this was intended essentially as triage
 
01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
to say we don't need to worry too much
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
about this section or in the case of the
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
principles we don't want those in the
 
01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
right that's
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
right but the
 
01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:24.140 align:start position:0%
deletion of the licenses
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
and moving the boards to PLC well that's
 
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.030 align:start position:0%
and moving the boards to PLC well that's
something

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that's in-house Bill too that is
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
generally done reasonably well with the
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
moving pieces of state government around
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's commonly in the budget and I'm
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
as long as you take the regulatory

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.250 align:start position:0%
structure with you I don't think it's an
issue

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
that you know the rules the requirements
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
for the licenses
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth and that ought to be and if
 
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
that's in not in house bill to along
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
with the movement we better make sure
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
that that happens
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
um the deletion of the licenses and the
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
combination of the boards we can't
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
discuss very much until we know the
 
01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
details and I'm very disappointed we
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the details the only
 
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
Advantage putting them in House Bill 2
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
has from my point of view
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
is that they've got an extra two weeks
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
to work on it House Bill 655 has to be
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so we're we're working on it we've
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
made a lot of progress but
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
it may or may not be ready to be exact
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
next week it may have to go go out
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
another week
 
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.149 align:start position:0%
another week
um

01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's but that's our deadline we don't
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
have we only have
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
we only have two weeks the budget has
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
another two weeks after that so
 
01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.209 align:start position:0%
another two weeks after that so
um

01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see what comes out in
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and how PLC answers the
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions we've asked before we do
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
anything other than suggest that the
 
01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.790 align:start position:0%
anything other than suggest that the

the initial restructuring for oplc the
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
investigatory stuff belongs in 655 and
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
not in house bill 2.
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
which will probably take at least five
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
or six pages away from oplc from from
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
house bill to
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments or
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
anything useful we can do
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
all right yes and I can imagine we will
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
have some more full committee work
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
sessions with more people involved it's
 
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.830 align:start position:0%
sessions with more people involved it's
uh

01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
all right
