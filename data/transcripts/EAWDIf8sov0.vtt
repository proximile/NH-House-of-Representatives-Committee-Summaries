00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
we were just conferring and um taking
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
notes of the representatives uh that
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
said they couldn't be here today so I
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
think we have
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have more than a quorum and we will
 
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.810 align:start position:0%
we have more than a quorum and we will
begin

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
begin
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I understand uh represent Faulkner
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
is not feeling well today so if you're
 
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
so we will start with the commandant for
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veterans home and today
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
with me I have
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
Brian Baker at supervisor of Safety and
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
Maintenance at the veterans home thank
 
00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.330 align:start position:0%
Maintenance at the veterans home thank
you

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.909 align:start position:0%
you
foreign

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
so I have a handout here a PowerPoint
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
handout uh just goes through the history
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire veterans home at
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
um that we've been around since 1890.
 
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
um we are 250 bed licensed facility
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
long-term care not skilled we are
 
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
budgeted for 225 and our current census
 
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
today is 129 veterans
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
um 118 men and 11 women
 
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
are our average age for our veteran is
 
00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 align:start position:0%
83 years old and their average stay is
 
00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
currently our census is that count
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
because of our staffing we have
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
challenges with Staffing as I'm sure
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has been experiencing and so
 
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 align:start position:0%
we feel that we can safely meet the
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
needs of the veterans at 131 veterans so
 
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's where we're Staffing or have
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
having the census go to but the goal is
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
with a lot of our
 
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts is to go up to that
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
225 we feel that we can fill those beds
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
and meet the needs of the veterans in
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
our mission is to provide the veterans
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
with the best quality of life with
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
dignity honor and respect
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
so our strategic infrastructure
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
priorities has really been about health
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
and life safety and to meet the VA
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
requirements we are surveyed by the VA
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
once a year and they are the ones who
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
give us our per diem rates for our
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
programs and so we need to meet the
 
00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
needs of their survey requirements as
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
well so our current projects are the
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
building-wide sprinkler system upgrade
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
that was something that wasn't put
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
through the regular budget process it
 
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
was actually added last year because we
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
had a VA survey when they came through
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
they did their inspection and one of our
 
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
sightings was that we didn't have
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
sprinklers in our closets
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
we had never had sprinklers in our
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
closets and we challenged that
 
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.529 align:start position:0%
closets and we challenged that
deficiency

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:44.539 align:start position:0%
deficiency
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
information that we had but they still
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
said no federally we had to have them so
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
that has been added to our current
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
projects and we're underway with that
 
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.730 align:start position:0%
projects and we're underway with that
project

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:01.259 align:start position:0%
we also have an existing parking lot
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
repair and Expansion Project that we're
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
hoping will be done this summer we're
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
underway with that and if you want more
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
details Brian could provide those
 
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.129 align:start position:0%
details Brian could provide those
timelines

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
timelines
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
the other one that is still on the books
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
with us is the Life Enhancement dementia
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
unit third floor Edition
 
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
I'm often asked why we're asked asking
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
for an addition when we don't have the
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
beds filled right now and that's because
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic it became even more
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
clear that we have to provide rooms to
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
Residents in a different manner our some
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
of our facility is an older facility and
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's two rooms with shared bathrooms uh
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
two people in each room and we know that
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
from a covered perspective or even any
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
kind of flu with any kind of congregate
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
living having them live so closely
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
together it can spread quickly so the
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
goal of the addition is to provide
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
smaller living housing with private
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
rooms and private bathrooms not to
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
increase our numbers but to provide a
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
better use of our facility and provide a
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
better safe environment for our veterans
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
and then the third the fourth one is a
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
medical lift installation uh we are
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
moving to providing uh putting in
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
bariatric lifts in the ceiling uh
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
instead of having Hoyer lifts that
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally we bring in the room and
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
we help lift a resident uh two reasons
 
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
for that is one they're uh they have
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
weight limits that we are seeing people
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
exceed uh and two that there is a risk
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
of injury both to the veteran and to the
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
staff that are helping so these are much
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
safer right now we're putting an 11 from
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
the last budget that's what this money
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
is for from the current project but we
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision when we look at
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
admissions where we put certain people
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
that need these our goal is to have them
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
in all the rooms eventually so I will
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
continue asking for
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
um a few here like 11 each year until we
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
get up to that number because the
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
numbers is large and so we're trying to
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
the three projects that were carried
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
forward on the governor's budget were
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
the site-wide drainage and water life
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
safety improvements
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
the entry Life Safety Improvement
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
entryway Life Safety Improvement and the
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
medical lift installation phase two
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I I like to include photos because I
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
think that I can tell you what's going
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
on but it's much easier for you to see
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
them and at this point I'd also like to
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
offer you if you would like to come in
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
for a tour of our facility we will show
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
you uh all the things we're talking
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
about all these are like the ugly parts
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
of the facility but I'll show you the
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
great Parts too with the residents but
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the water that's
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
coming up uh water drainage issues if
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's raining if we have snow melt off
 
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
pretty much anytime there's water that's
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
coming down out of the sky it's going to
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
come in our basement
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
we can see here this is water coming
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
right out of our datapore after a
 
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.449 align:start position:0%
right out of our datapore after a
rainstorm

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:13.459 align:start position:0%
rainstorm
 
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:17.060 align:start position:0%
this is the floor that is near our
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
emergency generator that it just comes
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
in and we've have to we have to vacuum
 
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:24.620 align:start position:0%
that out and mop it out
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
on the next page you'll see this is our
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
electrical panel and you can see the
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
again the same room and then we have the
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
dehumidifier that is working really hard
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
but this is a it's really corroding our
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
entryways our flooring on the next pay
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
the page that has it looks like a window
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is actually a entryway that goes
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
from our dining room into a hall which
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
residents use every day
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um many times a day this is eroding the
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
floor so the tiles are popping up
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're cracking and this is actually uh
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think Brian could speak better to this
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
what the second one is a Footers
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so the water is coming in basically
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
coming in along the footings and weeping
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
up through the floor so this is kind of
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
a small area that you're looking at here
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
but there's uh I mean I could have gone
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
taken pictures every 10 feet and you
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
would have seen where the water is
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
pushing up through the floor and it's
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
entryway Life Safety improvements this
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
is where we're asking to for funds to
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
construct four entryway canopies we
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
don't have any canopies over these areas
 
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
and we're showing you pictures of this
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
um this first picture of the snow coming
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
off the roof this is a temporary canopy
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
that the maintenance department has put
 
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.069 align:start position:0%
that the maintenance department has put
up

00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
um very temporary but because that is a
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
main entrance we have two main entrances
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
our staff come through we are worried
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
about the safety of them coming through
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is also
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um an entrance where residents will
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
often come out as well and so you'll see
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
the snow overhang on all of these areas
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
where it comes off we have to close down
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
a sidewalk every year in the front of
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
our building because the snow falls off
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
and we're just worried about the safety
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
of somebody getting hurt there so we're
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
asking for the entryway Life Safety
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
the medical lift installation is a
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
project that is outfitting the building
 
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
with ceiling lifts as I said this is an
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
example of what one looks like
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and it can it can lift 650 pounds
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um up to 650 and so we're really trying
 
00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
to have those in place so that we can
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
prevent injury and uh to both the
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
resident and the staff
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
and then I was asked to talk about the
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
lapse date extension budget and so uh
 
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
lapse date extension budget and so uh
the

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
firewall the Ladue firewall project has
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
the Ladue building is the project that
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
is at the VA right now that's the third
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
four building so we're waiting for the
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
VA the way the Veterans Administration
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
is is they get all of the requests from
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
all of the different state veterans
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
homes in the United States they put them
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
on the project list and then they choose
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
which projects each year so we're in
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
that process where they haven't chosen
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
us yet but that's one of the things that
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for is word from the VA
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then the parking lot as I spoke it's
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
due to be done this fall
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
um we're hoping sooner than later
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
because the parking lot right now is
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
very unsafe our sidewalks are unsafe so
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to see that happen sooner
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions from the
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019 align:start position:0%
representative Jack thank you Mr
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
chairman it's good to see you again uh
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
just to confirm we're going to lapse
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
item 223
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
on page 19 and that is a lapse of 1.293
 
00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
on page 19 and that is a lapse of 1.293
million

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
are we going to yes I would like to
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
continue us so we're going to delete
 
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
that from hb25 I have one more question
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh about on the
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
slide that has the building wide
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system and the medical lift
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
phase one it wasn't clear to me uh how
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
that was funded and what authorized it
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
we went to fiscal committee and GNC and
 
00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:45.610 align:start position:0%
we went to fiscal committee and GNC and
um

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
actual operations
 
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.790 align:start position:0%
actual operations
operations

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative Boyd thank you Mr
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
chairman comment on thank you for your
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you how many bariatric
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
lifts need to be installed
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
we have 11 that we're putting I know 11
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
come in but all together what's the
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
what's the long term
 
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I I think that if we could have 40 to
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
50 honestly like a middle middle of the
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
road for our staff uh for our rooms we
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
would be able to place people better so
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
50 would be the total I think that week
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
big deal yes okay follow-up Mr chairman
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
yes just a dovetail offer representative
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Jack's question I I didn't think it was
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
clear and I apologize regarding the
 
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.590 align:start position:0%
clear and I apologize regarding the
lapsing

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
lapsing
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
you are we are lapsing 1.293 million
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
dollars that is correct yes I'm sorry
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at Stephanie Kelly that's
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
okay no that's fine yes yes in layman's
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
terms you're giving it back to us
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
I I uh I have an obvious question
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can answer and perhaps
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's only one model
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
the um on the lifts and we're doing the
 
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:02.660 align:start position:0%
same thing in in our County nursing home
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh for staff and for the convenience of
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
the resident
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
um is 650 pounds where it starts is
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
there a 500 pound 400 pound model I
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
think that they go to the 650 as a
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
standard most of the equipment is now
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
going to 650 So when you buy a bariatric
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
lift it's 650 if you buy a bariatric bed
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
it's 650. okay thank you for that
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
welcome now yes representative
 
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.890 align:start position:0%
welcome now yes representative
Magic

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
Magic
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
I just have a simple question
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
how many veterans are in
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
your care at this facility 129 today we
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
have 100 129 veterans in our facility
 
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.450 align:start position:0%
have 100 129 veterans in our facility
today

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent Beloit
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
um just to explain so what are you going
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
to do to address that drainage it looked
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
pretty severe all that water going into
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
the basement so what's the plan for that
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just it doesn't seem like you're
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
spending that much money to do this so
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
what's the plan well our hope is that
 
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.220 align:start position:0%
somebody can come and do a design and
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
tell us how to fix it and we're hoping
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
that for the 350 we'll be able to find a
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
fix for that originally we thought that
 
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
it would be about 540
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
um thousand but uh we're hoping with
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
this we can do a site-wide assessment
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
drainage design and a fix
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it's gonna not gonna be too
 
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.669 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it's gonna not gonna be too
difficult

00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
 
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.409 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
yes

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
um pretty good price
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity on these lists
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
they're attached via into the ceilings
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes and does the ceiling because I know
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
square footage poundage per square foot
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
is sometimes an issue and especially in
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
older buildings is the building capable
 
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
older buildings is the building capable
of

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
safely handling
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
that requirement yeah so they before we
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
purchase these lifts and look to
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
purchasing these lifts they did have to
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
come out and do an assessment to make
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
sure that it could handle that weight
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
so it has been looked at
 
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
so it has been looked at
yes

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative Newman the building's
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
adjustable yes thank you
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
for clarification when you said the
 
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.130 align:start position:0%
for clarification when you said the
firewall

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
firewall
 
00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:26.419 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
replaced whatever
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
going back maybe the previous or maybe
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
before that capital budget
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
I remember a picture that showed the
 
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
um the the wooden frame ups and there
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
just wasn't any of Separation that
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
should have been done at time of
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
construction yeah yes that is correct so
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
in 2003 when the building was built
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was designed at the time for the fire
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
codes at that time and then the fire
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
codes change over time and same with the
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
sprinkler upgrades we have to upgrade
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
our building as the codes change
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
we will put you on our list of site
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
visits I I have never been there and I
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
would uh truly love to come by see the
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
facility and the folks so excellent
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
that'll conclude our meeting with the
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
veterans home and we will continue at 11
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
so for the committee we're we're running
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
through all of the um all the different
 
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:51.799 align:start position:0%
parts of our state government
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and so forth when we
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
conclude with this next Wednesday
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%

we'll start going through and and find
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
which items we can all agree on and
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
start through the process hopefully by
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
the 20th we're going to be to a point
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we can reach agreement make
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
amendments to House Bill 25 and then be
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%

with you
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
and present your capital budget and once
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record uh Helen
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
Hanks commissioner of the Department of
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
Corrections and to my right is John
 
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
Hansen our director of administration I
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to present
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
I skipped the first page that's not a
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
page one in the governor's proposed
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
capital budget you'll see we have two
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
items our radio system upgrade and
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
rebuilding the sewer line and grinder at
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state prison for men
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
the radio system upgrade is a project
 
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
we've been tracking and trending for
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
some time we still have analog system
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
and we need to move to a digital system
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that's our primary tool for Safety
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
and Security at all of our Correctional
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
locations if there's one tool a
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
corrections officer cannot go without it
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
is their radio and even the other
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that sends the
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
information to the radios is aged and it
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
is time to get this moving forward in
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
the proper direction and a replacement
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
in process the second project is a
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
project that was previously approved and
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
this is unless John corrects me
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
otherwise an additional appropriation
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
because the original funding was is no
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
longer in scope for the total cost of
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
the project and I'll look to John to
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
speak in depth on that project
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
so this is the one and uh sorry John
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hanson for the record director
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
administration department of corrections
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
um it's good to see a lot of the same
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
faces here so you know what I'm going to
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
be talking about uh this was the muffin
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
monster the sewer grinder which was put
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
in the street and Maguire Street the
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
city of Concord asked us to move it out
 
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
appropriately that was installed in 1994
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
right off the curb line but when they
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
went in to look at the design of how to
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
replace the muffin monster as well as
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
the sewer line going to it the cost has
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
escalated and it will require us to put
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
a building in because in this case we'll
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
now have an auger so a lot of the things
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
that don't make it through the grinder
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
will be picked up in auger and actually
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
brought out and put into the trash so
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
that's why the request for the
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
all right I just wanted to comment on
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
page two and three of the next slides
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
talk specifically about those two
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
projects number two showing our Radio
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
Room at our New Hampshire state prison
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
for men and referring back to the new
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
equipment needs to meet both state and
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
federal standards and obviously why
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're proceeding with that request and
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
slide number three yes is a lovely
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
picture of the muscle muffin monster on
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
South Street
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
if we uh have you go to page four we
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
we've included which is unusual for us
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
um hb2 items associated with a long
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
standing conversation around the
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the Hampshire state
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
prison for men
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
and trying to find a solution within our
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
state process on funding such a large
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
and significant project so in doing so
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
the governor included a non-lapsing
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
appropriation fund for the design and
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
construction of a new New Hampshire
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
state prison for men it is our largest
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
facility here in Concord and houses
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
today approximately 1200 men and has
 
00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:21.740 align:start position:0%
held upwards of 1600 men in the past
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
in addition to we've included for your
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
Vantage Point an hb2 item associated
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
with our computers and infrastructure as
 
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.770 align:start position:0%
with our computers and infrastructure as
well

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
do you wanna
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um and we follow
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
up on the following Pages if you have
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
the old form 1A which I believe uh you
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
have in front of you which is our
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
initial submission of what we submitted
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
we have our top seven there on that page
 
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see on page five
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
um highlighted on the left hand side is
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
items one and two which made the
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
governors recommended but there were
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
other items on there item number one was
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
our first request and this was actually
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
tailored down to a 2.5 million dollar
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
study to determine whether or not we
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
could put the prison where we think we
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
could put it and determine what the size
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
would be and that has now been changed
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
into what's in House Bill 2 which is a
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
50 million dollar uh budget for that to
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
start construction and item number two
 
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
the kitchen renovation that's the money
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we already have appropriated we
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
have 4.3 million dollars and that
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
project is in design and moving forward
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
but to actually complete that as we
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
started to get into the to the meat of
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
that building determined we had pipes
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
collapse beyond what we what we felt we
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
had we've been working with Public
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
Health on some of the things that needed
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be changed it'll come up in the
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
slides a little bit later on and
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
actually Public Works and the
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
engineering firm that they hired up that
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
to another 7.1 million dollars to
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
complete that project and I bring those
 
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
up just knowing that if we do move
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
forward with a 50 million dollar new
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
prison we will not need that additional
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
money because we can use the 4.3 million
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
dollars what's left of that unless the
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
architecture and engineering fee to keep
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
that sustainable and keep it so that
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's in compliance with the public
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
health regulations
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
um item number four let's get Buy number
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
three of course that's that radio system
 
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
upgrade the commissioner talked about is
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
the steam lines and traps again going in
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
and looking at Price escalations which
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
we've seen and I don't know whether
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
you've been following the news but just
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
since January of 2023 construction cost
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
ex escalations up 12 in just the last
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
three months steel cost went up 100
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
percent in the last three months
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
according to the to the statistics the
 
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
state of national statistics lumber
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
prices are up 90 percent glasses up 30
 
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
percent and the list goes on and on so
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
these price increases this is kind of a
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
theme as we go along here as we started
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
to get into that project we needed more
 
00:38:49.859 --> 00:38:51.589 align:start position:0%
to get into that project we needed more
money

00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
um to complete item number six the
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
perimeter and fence detection systems at
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire prison for men need
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
another million dollars we determined
 
00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
that there's too much work needed to be
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
done with steel and concrete allowing
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
the exterior perimeter walls to make
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
that again to keep that safe and secure
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
in both directions people coming in are
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get out
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
um item number seven is the construction
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
trades building at the women's facility
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
which is some of you folks that were
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
around during the time we built that
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
there was actually room set aside for
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
that which has now become a canteen uh
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
so we need to build an outer building
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
for the construction trades
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
and then following on page six of the
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
remaining items that were in your
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
original form 1A and I just go down
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
through these so that you can see the
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
ones for ncf and the other facilities
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll still need but if we get
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the money on the house bill too many of
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
these things will not be need to be
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
completed however one caveat the
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner I talk about quite quite
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
often is that it will take time to build
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
a new Men's prison that current Men's
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
prison needs to be completely functional
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
safe secure throughout that complete
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
duration until we actually move those
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
residents to the new facility and right
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
now what we're dealing with is the the
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
incarceration of those residents that's
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
the punishment the building and the
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
architecture shouldn't be and that's
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with today because of
 
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of repairs and things we have
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
and if I could the importance of the New
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men's
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is not just because it is
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
a Correctional Institution for people
 
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
who have committed felonies but the
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is equally if not more
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
important for the individuals who work
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
in there 24 hours a day seven days a
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
week when I walk into a unit after the
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
my 20th year with this organization and
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
I started in our reception and
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
diagnostic unit at the New Hampshire
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
state prison for men and when I went in
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
there last week and I appreciate the
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature have been
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
through the facility and those that have
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
yet been able to do that we certainly
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
offer that opportunity and see tarps
 
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
with hoses dripping into buckets right
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
where my officers are working it
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
continues to frustrate me that we're
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
working in a infrastructure that is as
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
old as 1878 and we really need the
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
legislature support in trying to rectify
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner continuing on
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
that page if you had any questions I can
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
get into the meat in more detail
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
granular detail on any of those ones
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
that are on that item on the page okay
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
why don't we pause for a moment and talk
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
about what's what's previously been
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
discussed repjam Jack did you have
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
something well uh thank you uh I would
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
could we speculate on whether the new
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
prison would go on the same site or or a
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
distant site
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
yes um so what we've been working along
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
with public works and with some others
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
and the City of Concord Deeds which
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
we're looking at adjacent to our
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
property there is 383 Acres on the side
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the road that the women's prison is
 
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
on in the Men's prison is on now the
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
land up back is an Old Quarry there are
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
many places where there's ledge
 
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
outcroppings and as we did with the
 
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
women's uh we plan would be to to scope
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
that land out and potentially do what we
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
did at the women's facility which you're
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with we crushed that granite
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
and we used that for the product on site
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
eliminating all trucking on North State
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
Street which the city and the abutters
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
were very concerned with except for a
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
few minor loads of gravel that came in
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
later on so that would be the site up
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
back we have a lot of work to do to make
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
sure it's it's feasible but if it's
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
where we think it will be it will be far
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
enough out of sight of Mind from all the
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
residents in that area it's going to be
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
buttered by the Cavalry cemetery on one
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
side in Long Pond or Penacook Lake on
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up uh thank you one of
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
the things that mitigated to putting the
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
women's prison where it is was sharing
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and utilities and so
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
forth is that still going to be a
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
consideration with with that site yes
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
exactly and as as we work through this
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and I looked at that
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
site with all the utilities that we have
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
there we have the 60 inch high pressure
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
gas main That's Unique for the city of
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
Concord we have the highest power that
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
you can get off that power line which
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
comes the same one in the trunk with
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
Concord Hospital we have the water which
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
is again it's adjacent to the to the
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
reservoir the City Reservoir there may
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
be some pumps and things needed but yes
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
utilities are there
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative valois thank you Mr
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
chairman the loan I'm sorry so I want to
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
talk about Staffing and the facilities
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
um I know that you are severely
 
00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.130 align:start position:0%
um I know that you are severely
understaffed

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:37.849 align:start position:0%
understaffed
um

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
so are you taking that into
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
consideration for your design for the
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
new facility so that it minimized so
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
actually you can kind of get by with
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
fewer staff because I I think everyone's
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
working overtime now pretty much
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question yes the
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
staffing has been a challenge and uh
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
significantly exacerbated post covet we
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
had a lot of individuals deservedly
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
retire after those uh grueling years and
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
the current campus it literally the fact
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
that I call it a campus is already
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
Staffing inefficient and so just as we
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
learned our lessons as we built the
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
women's facility and even our experience
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
in 2000 with the northern Correctional
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
Facility this facility would be built
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
focusing on how do we staff this safely
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
but efficiently and incorporating
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
technologies that best assist in a
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
correctional institution thank you for
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
in in the let's discuss the kitchen
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
um that was we talked a lot about the
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen last capital budget uh had to be
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
done need to be done it's not done
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct so what what's the scope
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
of what you what you have accomplished
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
at this point was it life safety issues
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
or what would you take care of so uh in
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
truth the construction work has not
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
started we have spent a tremendous
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
amount of time trying to design
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
something that met that 4.3 million
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
dollar budget
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
um and as you know that that kitchen on
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
that lower level in that that wet dank
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
area needed to be moved out and as we
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
started to look at moving it out into
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
the odd area we started to look at how
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
it would have to be elevated to a point
 
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.770 align:start position:0%
it would have to be elevated to a point
where

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
we were talking some serious increases
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
in cost with steel and concrete and the
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
design itself so at this point we have
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
not done a renovation of the existing
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
kitchen at all however
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
um again the plan would be if House Bill
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
2 is is passed with a 50 million we
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
would take that money and bring that
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
back into the existing kitchen where it
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
is now and make modifications using
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do some value Engineering
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
in using like dining hall three and some
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
of the other places that are out of that
 
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
area as a food prep area we're also
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
actually this afternoon we're talking
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
with some peop some vendors who might be
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
able to help us augment it with some
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
food coming in from the outside so
 
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
there's a multitude of things we can do
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
differently if we don't have to build
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
this Behemoth of a brand new kitchen
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
elevated outside into the yard area
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me and
 
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.530 align:start position:0%
excuse me and
um

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:14.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
it just helped me with my memory your
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
projects are overseen by the public
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
works department State yeah
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
okay and just to the point of additional
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
clarification we were using the existing
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
kitchen capital budget appropriation to
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
shore up the existing kitchen to stem us
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
until we move into a new facility it
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't completely Rectify but we would
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
be working hand in hand with Health and
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
Human Services the best that we can in
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
the space some other historical issues
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
that were not contemplated were we found
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
some coal Pockets underneath the ground
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
that interfered with the infrastructure
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
and putting a structure where we would
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
prefer the adjacency to our existing
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
dining room and numerous other
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
complications started to arise as we
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
dove into the scope of this project
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh your your one more and I'll
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
come to you your your other money is our
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
famous what what you refer to it as the
 
00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:11.540 align:start position:0%
muffin grinder
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
they um so just help me understand that
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
a little better so we identified the
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
problem the the town the city wanted you
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
to move it from where it was and make
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
improvements but now it turns out that's
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
not what we need to do and we need to
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
build the structure so no I'm sorry if I
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
misspoke it's still plan a we're still
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
going to do exactly what the city asked
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
us to do which is bring the line down
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
into our yacht and get that off from
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
North State Street because every time we
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
plug up
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
and we plug up quite a bit we bring in a
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
outside company that does jetting
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
services and we flush that line out so
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
the rest of the city can get their
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
Seward moving sewer line moving down
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hall Street so this would bring our
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
lines together on our side of the road
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
so the problem would be all ours okay
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
um uh code now to representative
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
taking my questions it's actually a
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
two-part question instead of doing a
 
00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:14.390 align:start position:0%
two-part question instead of doing a
follow-up

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh part A of that question is dealing
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
with the radios uh and you indicated
 
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
that they were analog radios which uh
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of the law enforcement services
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
I don't believe have analog radio so I
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
would imagine with a yes or no that kind
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
of hinders your ability to talk to the
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
rest of the public safety force and Part
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
B of that question is when you migrate
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
over to a digital system that would also
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh enable you do then to talk to the
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
rest of the public safety world as the
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
need is required
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh yes you are exactly correct so yes to
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
the first part and yes to the second
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
part and just to remind the committee
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
probation and parole officers are part
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
of this department and So that obviously
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
they're in all of New Hampshire
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
communities and they will be part and
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have yes I do apologize
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
I do have one follow-up uh so with the
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
same type of radios then uh if your
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
transportation officer is moving uh
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
people to and from the hospital and our
 
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
doctors and stuff they will now have a
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
radio that will communicate
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
effectively with the other environment
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to use a cell phone
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
or something or something you have to
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
get the inside track on this sir yes
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative that's exactly what uh we
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
have for problems when we move between
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
facilities like from Berlin to Concord
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
there's dead spots on that two-way radio
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the repeaters that
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
some of the other agencies do in full
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
disclosure I worked at Department of
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
Transportation for 16 years as an
 
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.349 align:start position:0%
Transportation for 16 years as an
administrator

00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
um the radios that we upgraded in 1996
 
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.510 align:start position:0%
um the radios that we upgraded in 1996
there

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
were what we have now at Department of
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
Corrections so we have a very old radio
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
system which anybody can monitor when we
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
have an incident and our our plan would
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
be and we're and another thing the
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
department of safety they have a a new
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
process we go through them to make sure
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
we're buying the right product and
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
they're helping us with that purchase so
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
that that amount was modified and will
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
be working directly with them on this
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
purchase if we get the money
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative Newman
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
studies went on and grounds could be a
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
site could be identified and ground
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
could be broken and construction started
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
what would you think the best situation
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be for a new timeline for a new
 
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.349 align:start position:0%
would be for a new timeline for a new
structure

00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
so as as you know with the biennium
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
budget it takes time to do these
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
projects there'll be quite a bit of um
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
architecture engineering design we're
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
held by some certain standards under law
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure we build a facility with
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
programs so to to answer your question
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
if this was fast tracked all the way
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
through I
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
I would have to defer to public works
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
but I would say between six and eight
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
years if it was fast tracked all the way
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
through before we cut the ribbon follow
 
00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.910 align:start position:0%
through before we cut the ribbon follow
up

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
so I I believe I I heard some hesitancy
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
to spend maybe upwards of seven million
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
to do the kitchen but if you could keep
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
it together
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that it could be kept
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
together for six or seven years we could
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
do this if we if we start looking at
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
this differently now and stop looking at
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
a complete new design and start putting
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
money back into equipment as a matter of
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
fact Heidi laramie's here from our
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
agency and she's now been working with
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
public works on buying new equipment for
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
that existing kitchen as we speak so
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
that that will be in compliance
 
00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:08.339 align:start position:0%
yeah representative noon if I could also
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
add we're also careful that there'll be
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
some opportunity uh with the budget
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
process if we needed to come and ask for
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts to continue to bridge
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
that kitchen then we would obviously go
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
through the budgeting process in this
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
committee to do so
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Mills
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you Mr chair uh going
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
back to the kitchen which we've dealt
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
with on this as long as I can remember
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
being on this on this committee uh
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
has has the health department ever come
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
in and and
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
just been appalled and tried to shut
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
that place down yet because I having
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
spent a couple of years in Food Service
 
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know how how they even let you
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
operate like that
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
I couldn't answer that so um so we
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
started right out of the gate and and
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you again for that initial launch
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
of money the 4.3 million dollars but
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
immediately thereafter we started to
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
work directly with public health and
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
they do come and inspect us every six
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
months and we do fail inspections quite
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
often and we do make repairs
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
um it is a very difficult thing it's
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
because it's a constant
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
the area is is got some leaks coming
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
from a design on a ramp and that's where
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
one of our major issues are with that
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
facility as the ramp comes up in over
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
the bakery
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
um that's a water issue and beyond that
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in some of the slides a
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
little later on I've got pictures of the
 
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
quarry tile that's broken up the kettles
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
which you'll see the tarps that we we
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
came up with an idea we saw it uh I
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
started RV place where they have tarps
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
with hose clamps in the middle and
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's what we started to uh to put into
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
the facility just to keep the water
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
going the right direction so are they
 
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:52.910 align:start position:0%
going the right direction so are they
appalled

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
appalled
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
maybe that's too strong a word are they
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
are Partners yes we are working with
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
them I just spoke to them two weeks ago
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
on a conference call
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
um well we have a little bit of time
 
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.210 align:start position:0%
um well we have a little bit of time
here

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
I've had the pleasure of touring both
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Old and the new and when we went to
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
the women's prison it was had just been
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
completed and we were walking through
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
so that was that was a major project a
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
major build
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
um what if what have you learned what
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
have been the downfalls of x if I
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
remember right we were using panelized
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
walls and so forth we're now about to
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
Embark into a much larger facility what
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
have you learned that will be done
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
better the next time around
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
good question good question we we did
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
learn quite a bit from that as as many
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know that was a construction manager
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
at risk project the first one the state
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
has ever done so we scoped every single
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
trade and got the best what we call
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
Guaranteed maximum price on paper and
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
signed to us so that this guy is going
 
00:54:59.809 --> 00:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
to do the flat work this guy's going to
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
bring in the panelized construction and
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
the reason we did that is because we
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough money to really do
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
what we intended to do so we did a
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of value engineering
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we could include the
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
ball field and the gymnasium and the
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
porticos and the things that we really
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
needed in the structure so what we
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
learned from that is construction
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
manager management at risk
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
being new to the state was a little
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
difficult because most all of us who
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
worked for the state for quite some time
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
I have 28 plus years in we work on a low
 
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
bid and that's a type of project that
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
we're familiar with so when you talk
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
about okay now you're the general
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
contractor you've got a construction
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
manager working with you and you're
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
making these choices on everything you
 
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:40.970 align:start position:0%
making these choices on everything you
build

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
it was time consuming
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
um very time consuming uh seven six days
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
a week many times I think that that
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
project took a lot longer as as we
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
needed to come back to you and ask for
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
more money another 12.6 million to
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
complete it
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
um I think looking at this a different
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
way and using standard materials and a
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
a design which reduces recidivism is
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
really what we need to do and there's
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
many new designs out there around uh
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
around the world some of the best in
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
Scandinavia I'm not suggesting we build
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
that but that these new designs that
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
really as I say the punishment's already
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
there they're confined they're under our
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
control the facility and the way the
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
Concord prison is set up now it just
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
I've got a list here of 121 work orders
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance work orders just from the
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
beginning of December
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
um and just to highlight a few of them
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
locks and doors are us because we're a
 
00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
locks and doors are us because we're a
prison

00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.150 align:start position:0%
prison
um

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
just picking a few metal plates over
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
holes and steam lines come through that
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's a serious issue fire suppression
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
systems not working uh
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh Windows shattered doors won't open
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
kitchen exterior door needs to be
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
replaced these are just in the last
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
three months and that's because we
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
double bunked that facility we
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
overworked many of the mechanisms and as
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
time went on everything worked Beyond
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
its usable life and uh
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question to build a
 
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
new prison
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be something we're familiar with
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
on the property but as far as the design
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
goes we'd work heavily with Public Works
 
00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
a good partners there and hire an
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
Architects and engineer through their
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
vetting process who knows these things
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
and get it done right
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you did you have a question
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a great moment okay
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions yes
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative boy
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman commissioner
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
director thank you for your testimony so
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
far regarding the the sewer
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
when you reposition that sewer is that
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
going to be be aligned with the proposed
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
project that that that everything's
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
gonna this new through line that's going
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
to go in that when you transition to the
 
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
new facility we're not re Reinventing
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
the well by having to recreate a new
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
sewer line good question
 
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
um we have a large um arched sewer line
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
that comes through the prison right now
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
that actually feeds from the women's
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
prison right down through to North State
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
Street so we would continue to use that
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
line as far as I know
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
um there may be some nuances where we
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
could come down call Street or Palm
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
Street but depending on where the new
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
prison would be located but yes this
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be bad this wouldn't be wasting
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
money to do this project because we're
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to need this muffin monster
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
regardless for the women's prison and
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
everything else we build up behind that
 
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:40.220 align:start position:0%
so it's it's necessary it's not a change
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
dramatic change in where that line would
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
go there's only really one track if any
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
of you folks are familiar with the Old
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
Concord Electric now the unitel building
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
McGuire Street once the Smoke Stack
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
properties right down that bank right
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
along the railroad track it's direct
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
drive all the way to Hull Street so when
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
we send things down there like blankets
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
and assorted other items I go down and
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
identify them and
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
people do flush a lot and this will
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
prevent that from actually reaching Hall
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
Street and causing us to do a massive
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
cleanup down there
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
committee represent Cloutier uh thank
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh can you tell me and I
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
realize it varies today what is the
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
current population of the Men's prison
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
in Concord
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Clover I
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
believe I said it's approximately 1200
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
men this morning okay thank you I'm
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
sorry no it's all right uh can I follow
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
up please Mr chairman what is there a
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
certain capacity though of the it's 1200
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
now and in other words for safety
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
reasons and if it went over would you
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
transfer any prisoners I guess it would
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
be to the Berlin facility or another
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
facility if it went over a certain
 
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.289 align:start position:0%
facility if it went over a certain
figure

00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
represent includer that's a reasonable
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
question we do those transfers on a
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
regular basis between the two facilities
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
and yes we look to see if we can balance
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
capacity and Staffing by making those
 
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.170 align:start position:0%
capacity and Staffing by making those
transfers

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
um I will let you know we did two
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
summers ago shut down the second floor
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
Hancock building because we had that
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity in a population reduction as
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
I continue to watch the admission rate
 
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
at the within the organization I have to
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
look very long and hard about whether I
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
open that second floor because that
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
means approximately 14 new posts that
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'd have to be filling every day with an
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
already challenged Staffing pattern
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
and one further just further questions
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I mean if if you reached and
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
I mean a hypothetical over capacity it
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
was thought of and because I heard from
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
an informed source that the federal
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
prison in Berlin has a lot of XX
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
capacity and I I don't know whether
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's true or not but if you thought if
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
you had to have contingency plans if
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
there was too much too many inmates
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
especially in Concord I mean maybe even
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
Berlin too the facility there of
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the federal of an
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
emergency I don't just speculation uh
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's a fair speculation having worked
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
with the federal bureau prisons during
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
covid I know that I would have to have a
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
federal agreement with them and we'd
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
have to go through that process both at
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
the federal level then at the state
 
01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:08.809 align:start position:0%
the federal level then at the state
level

01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
um I've heard they've been underused
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
under utilized over utilized and when I
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
reach out to that Ward at that facility
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
I I find the facts and in fact as of
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
recently the Federal Bureau of Prisons
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
did move large buses of individuals to
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
that facility and there was some Scuttle
 
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the community asking if that was us
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
doing large bus transfers to our
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
facility but I think it's a reasonable
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
area we would not leave unexplored okay
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you commissioner thank you Mr
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
chairman you're very welcome thank you
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
any other further question yes
 
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.510 align:start position:0%
any other further question yes
representative

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
I see that there's a preliminary study
 
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
and and that so some of the questions
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
question I asked might have that's what
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the study is but do you
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
have an idea of the ideal size as far as
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals to be
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in a new prison is is there
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
goal you have right now or is that
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
something that you're gonna will come
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
out of the study
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar that is a great
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
question and having gone through the
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
women's prison project and also looked
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
at larger scoped projects across the
 
01:02:17.819 --> 01:02:18.589 align:start position:0%
at larger scoped projects across the
country

01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh calculating by classification level
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
based on the history of the department
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
is part of the design process and I want
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
to say that when we built the women's
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
prison the calculations were accurate we
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
moved in and filled that location and
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
when the legislature was mindful to be
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
prepared for us to build another housing
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
unit in the event we needed it we we
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
would have been able to do that the
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
fortunate change was that the reduction
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
in women becoming incarcerated happened
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
so we're using about half the capacity
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
today so your question is so important
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
that we look at what our history is in
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration that we look at what the
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and the Judiciary does on
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
sentencing and trying to forecast that
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
the best way that we can so that we
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
don't build something too small and end
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
up we were as a state in 2010 and 11
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is the reason the infrastructure
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
at Men's has eroded so quickly because
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
we quickly almost doubled the design
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
build capacity of that facility and in
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
addition to over the over the capacity
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
even of our North Country facility where
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
we had upwards of 730 people and
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
converted gyms to dorms which we don't
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
have today
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes representative
 
01:03:36.299 --> 01:03:37.430 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes representative
Newman

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
I heard on public radio just the other
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
day that the National Guard was going to
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
be assisting with your Staffing they'll
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
have some training but how quickly will
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
they be able to start
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman yes as a
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
last uh Resort and request which is what
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
we reserve that ask for we're asking for
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
less people than we did the last time if
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's the shining lining we're asking
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
for 18 the governor authorized that they
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
will begin their training next week just
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
as we did the last time with the hope
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
that we'll have those resources on posts
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
which are non-direct posts they're
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
control rooms that are unarmed
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
by March 18th is Our Hope
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you oh I'm sorry did you did you
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
want to continue on on your slide
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
presentation or are you okay where we
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
are I think it's uh fair to say we just
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
want to point out in the slide deck we
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
took pictures of all of the areas and
 
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
all the priorities
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
um to show you we don't want to throw
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
bad money at an infrastructure that's
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
degrading we're really looking for your
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
support to the hb2 items to really move
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
the state and this organization in a
 
01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:53.339 align:start position:0%
positive direction in addition to on
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
slide seven we give you some
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs and then on slide
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
eight I want to be mindful we did try to
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
find a path forward to bring that
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
project to this committee as is the
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
history of the state and your collective
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
intelligence around capital budget
 
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so we did talk with the
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
state treasurer and you'll see on slide
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
eight some several questions that we
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
asked of of her that she provided to us
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
as we were trying to say how do we do
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
this in the state of New Hampshire how
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
do we move such a significantly large
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
price project forward so if you have any
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions on any areas of the slide deck
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
pictures certainly I think tell a lot
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we incorporate the costs and then on
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
the very last page we have a list of the
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
current projects and I know we'll be
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
back here on Monday to talk about those
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%

understand uh so I'm starting with the
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
the second page uh summer of requests
 
02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'll go through these individually uh in
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
the following pages but uh we are asking

for uh
 
02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
support for it infrastructure again I'll
 
02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
go into the details groundwater
 
02:35:48.410 --> 02:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
monitoring our drinking water State
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%

02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
each one of those we do want to note
 
02:36:02.290 --> 02:36:02.300 align:start position:0%
that there is a typo
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the documentation for the drinking
 
02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
water State revolving alone fund match
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's overstated by forty thousand
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
dollars so as you see in our handout It
 
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
should read
 
02:36:17.650 --> 02:36:17.660 align:start position:0%
10488 283
 
02:36:21.889 --> 02:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:23.929 --> 02:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
so so there's a cost savings right there
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
so if we can
 
02:36:29.170 --> 02:36:29.180 align:start position:0%
so moving to the the next uh page three
 
02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
uh this is the the detailed breakout for
 
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
it infrastructure I understand some of
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
this uh was likely talked to at the doit
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
discussion with commissioner Goulet I
 
02:36:44.929 --> 02:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
believe so the first uh line in the the
 
02:36:46.809 --> 02:36:46.819 align:start position:0%
the most impactful line as far as
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
expense is the our One-Stop database uh
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
so uh again we we Endeavor and continue
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
to expand our presence for e-permitting
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh public information access GIS mapping
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and and our reporting we have reporting
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for a lot of our federal
 
02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:09.469 align:start position:0%
requirements for a lot of our federal
our

02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
environmental information uh to the
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
federal government and they have very
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
yeah precise for one of a better word uh
 
02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have to meet to to
 
02:37:22.969 --> 02:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
get that data to them uh in all those
 
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
cases the more we're able to automate
 
02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
those more more we're able to have them
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
accessible online uh report reporting to
 
02:37:31.969 --> 02:37:31.979 align:start position:0%
Us online and from Us online the more
 
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
efficient we become so that this is very
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
important to us so this first first
 
02:37:39.050 --> 02:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
large project for One Stop is to
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
continue the work that we've already
 
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
started to to modernize that the the
 
02:37:44.929 --> 02:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
good news bad news is the more we we put
 
02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
online the more customers in in our
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
constituents uh I think rightly so
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
expect to see it online so we have to
 
02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
maintain what we're currently doing
 
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
while we improve it at the same time so
 
02:37:57.050 --> 02:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit like fixing your car
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
as you're driving down the road but uh
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're we're asking for funds
 
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
to continue to do that uh the second uh
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
line item is for upgrades to our air
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
monitoring stations uh we run a network
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
of a dozen air monitoring stations all
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh these are we
 
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
liked again to get these as automated as
 
02:38:21.290 --> 02:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
possible uh which uh saves saves uh
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
staff time to drive and visit them and
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
and also uh helps uh again the public is
 
02:38:29.210 --> 02:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
now expecting to see the data that we
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
collect almost real time so this helps
 
02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
get us there so this will allow upgrades
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
upgrades to to those stations as well as
 
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh purchase of a a mobile auditing and
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
calibration platform to to to to move
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
between these sites so we can meet
 
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements uh for our air
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring the third item is uh is uh
 
02:38:57.770 --> 02:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
basically uh digitizing uh for our
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
subsurface Bureau I know the chair is
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
very familiar with this uh we we have
 
02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
begun digitizing records from 2015 on
 
02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
this will allow us to go back we have we
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
have uh documents going back to the 60s
 
02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
and this will allow us to get those
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
scanned and put in the system so they're
 
02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
available electronically not only to our
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
staff while we do our work but also to
 
02:39:23.210 --> 02:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
the to the public uh we think that will
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
a a uh be a very value-added uh Endeavor
 
02:39:32.809 --> 02:39:32.819 align:start position:0%
to do that the fourth uh item in this
 
02:39:35.690 --> 02:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
listing is our regarding our our water
 
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
lab uh we handle thousands of samples uh
 
02:39:40.969 --> 02:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
annually and they're tracked currently
 
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
through uh uh for those who who are
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
probably of my age also uh remember
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Access so this is kind of a
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
do-it-yourself database so that's where
 
02:39:53.389 --> 02:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're currently currently handled we
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to upgrade that to again to be a
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
much more uh
 
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
accessible uh and more professional
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
database uh for one of the better words
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's better makes it easier for the
 
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
public and us to to get at that data in
 
02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
our fifth um
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
item here has to do with our public
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
bathing our Pools and Spas program uh so
 
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
as a caveat it may not be obvious this
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
is kind of one of the cats and dogs that
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
are fall under the Des purview so we
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
have a a program that that is
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
responsible for basically it's a public
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
safety uh issue for Pools and Spas uh
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that are regulated uh if we go back
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
in time before covid uh some of you may
 
02:40:38.809 --> 02:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
remember we had a Legionella outbreak in
 
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampton uh and there there is you know
 
02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that resulted in some
 
02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
deaths uh based with on that experience
 
02:40:51.309 --> 02:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
that was an unregistered Spa
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh that wasn't even in our program but
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
what should have been uh we now have
 
02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
there was legislation since then to
 
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
require registration uh by Pool owners
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh annual recertification and then
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
operator training and certification uh
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
as this new new enhanced program spins
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
up we want this to be as web enabled as
 
02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
possible also just for the same reasons
 
02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
I talked about One Stop we want our
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
staff to minimize the number of Staff we
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
need to run the program but also make it
 
02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
more accessible to the regulated
 
02:41:27.530 --> 02:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
community and to be blunt in this case
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
so the average citizen can go online and
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
see that the the pool they're sending
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
so our next slide here is is titled
 
02:41:47.210 --> 02:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
ground well monitoring network uh this
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
this line item uh we have existing
 
02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:52.979 align:start position:0%
ground uh water uh Wells throughout
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
about 30 throughout the state currently
 
02:41:57.170 --> 02:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
this will add as the slide mentions 25
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
new new wells as well as Telemetry again
 
02:42:02.349 --> 02:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
so we can get this real-time reporting
 
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh for both the citizenry as well as our
 
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
staff this is particularly important
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've gone three years now in the state
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh we are different
 
02:42:15.050 --> 02:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
parts of the state state have been in
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
severe drought and this really will help
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
us to to be able to monitor that and
 
02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
also to be blunt help predict that
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
coming and coming in of drought as well
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
as coming out of drought uh one of the
 
02:42:30.170 --> 02:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
issues we have is even with the current
 
02:42:33.650 --> 02:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
30 Wells uh 11 of those are groundwater
 
02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
and we really need excuse me uh our most
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
of these are surface water wells and we
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
really need the wells to be to be
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
productive for this type of use they
 
02:42:44.929 --> 02:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
need to be further deeper in groundwater
 
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
Wells so this will get us closer to that
 
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
and again obviously Mr chair I can take
 
02:42:56.690 --> 02:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
questions anytime anybody would like
 
02:42:58.849 --> 02:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
um okay why don't we do that uh
 
02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner let's
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
um go ahead represent me on the
 
02:43:05.270 --> 02:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
digitizing uh historical documents
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
involved going back to the 60s 750
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
000 because that do everything back six
 
02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:14.060 align:start position:0%
piece forward to the iron space
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
allocation you're doing and what is the
 
02:43:19.010 --> 02:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
timeline to get it done yeah I'm going
 
02:43:20.570 --> 02:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
to defer to I don't know if Sue knows
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
that answer I I'm not sure I'm willing
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
to guarantee we'll get every document
 
02:43:25.730 --> 02:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
for that that amount of money if that's
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
that was the question in helping us
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
right into the County County registered
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
Deeds this seems a little on the pricing
 
02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
side but maybe the location or access
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
from the records and you know the at
 
02:43:42.050 --> 02:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
least in the county environment
 
02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
no matter how much money you give them
 
02:43:46.130 --> 02:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
they can only do so many documents when
 
02:43:49.010 --> 02:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
they allocated time sequence so this is
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
a multi-year project and if so we find
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much money a lot of time
 
02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:55.450 align:start position:0%
pretty much money a lot of time
yeah

02:43:55.450 --> 02:43:55.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
um essentially
 
02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:03.070 align:start position:0%
um essentially
um

02:44:03.070 --> 02:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:06.889 --> 02:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
this we have we've kind of essentially
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:09.469 align:start position:0%
we have
um

02:44:09.469 --> 02:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:12.770 --> 02:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
estimated and and calculated out that we
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
have approximately 750 000 records from
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
1986 to 2015.
 
02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and at the price that they are asking
 
02:44:25.490 --> 02:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
that will get us every all of those
 
02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
documents done and then while they're
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
doing that we're going to have staff go
 
02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
back through the really old documents
 
02:44:36.530 --> 02:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
clean those and then work with those
 
02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to work to get those done we
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
are looking at
 
02:44:45.770 --> 02:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
probably two years between the time we
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
start this and when all of these
 
02:44:51.290 --> 02:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.809 --> 02:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
this is not a fast process
 
02:44:56.270 --> 02:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these documents are
 
02:44:56.280 --> 02:44:58.130 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these documents are
oversized

02:44:58.130 --> 02:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
oversized
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
so it makes it even harder or takes
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to follow up on that
 
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
and then I'll come back to you
 
02:45:09.530 --> 02:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative so when when you're going
 
02:45:11.690 --> 02:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
through this and I applaud you I mean
 
02:45:15.050 --> 02:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
this is this is documentation that towns
 
02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
can't find and homeowners can't find so
 
02:45:21.410 --> 02:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
this is fantastic when you when you're
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
going through this process
 
02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
you will do the actual plans and just
 
02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
now show operational approvals and that
 
02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
02:45:32.270 --> 02:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:45:39.170 --> 02:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in your I.T
 
02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure proposal
 
02:45:44.990 --> 02:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
where is cyber security and and
 
02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
um how are you protecting yourself from
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
all those great people out there who
 
02:45:53.809 --> 02:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
for those who know me that's a an issue
 
02:45:56.929 --> 02:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
that's near and dear to my heart
 
02:46:01.010 --> 02:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
actually so again that's all this work
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with uh doit and to
 
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
be blunt a lot of this work the upgrades
 
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
that type of thing needs to be done uh
 
02:46:11.389 --> 02:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
for a lot of reasons but one of them is
 
02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
for cyber security when you're when the
 
02:46:16.490 --> 02:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of the original coding that was
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
done is not compliant with that type of
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
requirement uh we have some Sometimes
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
some embedded here is some software
 
02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
systems are not compliant with that so
 
02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
that is another great reason that you
 
02:46:30.889 --> 02:46:30.899 align:start position:0%
bring up why this work needs to be done
 
02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
to keep us in that mode and I and I will
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
say and I think represent I know
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey will remember
 
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
the chair will remember
 
02:46:41.630 --> 02:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
some years back we actually pulled our
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
database offline because we had done a
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
a a a doit had contracted with an
 
02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
auditor to look at and they they had
 
02:46:53.330 --> 02:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
they had basically done some penetration
 
02:46:56.210 --> 02:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
testing of our systems and that was a
 
02:46:58.610 --> 02:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
problem and and so I felt it was very
 
02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
painful if I think for everybody but I
 
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
felt we didn't want to lose that data
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we we felt we didn't have a choice
 
02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
but to to bring it offline recode to
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
take some of those vulnerabilities out
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
and then put it back on
 
02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you are you all set representative
 
02:47:17.270 --> 02:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you on um yes representative
 
02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
hello

02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
hello
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
I just don't know a lot about your
 
02:47:28.439 --> 02:47:30.410 align:start position:0%
I just don't know a lot about your
department

02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
are you is this department that's
 
02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.670 align:start position:0%
are you is this department that's
monitoring

02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
02:47:37.010 --> 02:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
the trash the multi-state trash dumping
 
02:47:39.410 --> 02:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
in the state doing water samples around
 
02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:40.849 align:start position:0%
in the state doing water samples around
it

02:47:40.849 --> 02:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's with a regulatory
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
Agency for Waste Management which is
 
02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
landfills hazardous waste uh chemicals
 
02:47:52.370 --> 02:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
Etc in that respect the burning of trash
 
02:47:54.290 --> 02:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
in Manchester which they tell me
 
02:47:57.050 --> 02:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
represents 27 percent of our air
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
pollution in the state
 
02:48:02.330 --> 02:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not aware of that factoid
 
02:48:05.090 --> 02:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
but but yeah so so I think you're
 
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
talking about the sludge incinerator is
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
that that sound correct I suppose I
 
02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:09.710 align:start position:0%
that that sound correct I suppose I
guess

02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:48:10.849 --> 02:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
I guess when they burn
 
02:48:10.859 --> 02:48:11.990 align:start position:0%
I guess when they burn
trash

02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
trash
 
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
Hospital waste incinerator I know I have
 
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
director right here uh so those are
 
02:48:19.730 --> 02:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
subject to federal regulations and most
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.809 --> 02:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
yeah so so there was a time when medical
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
waste incinerators were were doing that
 
02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements came in and and the
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
the cost of compliance was such that
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
they decided just to ship it off instead
 
02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you uh
 
02:48:42.170 --> 02:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
represent Newman
 
02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:50.570 --> 02:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
just do you are you practicing good uh
 
02:48:54.290 --> 02:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
backup and and backup practices yes
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
again so we work closely with Duit and
 
02:48:58.969 --> 02:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
that's certainly an element of what we
 
02:49:02.210 --> 02:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
do uh for a lot of reasons uh you know
 
02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's some senses instances that the
 
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
data will go to the cloud protecting
 
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's very important but even just
 
02:49:10.670 --> 02:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
cyber security aside just to the extent
 
02:49:12.650 --> 02:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
you have data on a server and the server
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
fails that's a you know that that's a
 
02:49:18.490 --> 02:49:18.500 align:start position:0%
bad practice not to have a backup
 
02:49:21.410 --> 02:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh commissioner Vaca goes
 
02:49:22.969 --> 02:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott if I can go back to
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
phase two uh to replace the One-Stop
 
02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:26.990 align:start position:0%
phase two uh to replace the One-Stop
system

02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
are is it replacing or is it or are you
 
02:49:33.650 --> 02:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
adding programs to it
 
02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
I I think we'd say both both I think and
 
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why sometimes when we talk
 
02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
about replacing One Stop you know one
 
02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
stop as you're probably aware has kind
 
02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
of evolved over the years right so it's
 
02:49:46.610 --> 02:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
what 28 different databases that have
 
02:49:49.010 --> 02:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
kind of so you know my view is one stop
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
is our
 
02:49:53.330 --> 02:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
is what we call our enterprise system to
 
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
to have e-permitting and environmental
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
data available to us all so so it's a
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of both so but but we do want
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
we need to revamp the system we have and
 
02:50:06.170 --> 02:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
again as I mentioned uh not to be
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
repetitive but the other challenge is
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
rightly so uh
 
02:50:14.809 --> 02:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
the citizenry and our clients expect the
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
existing services to be maintained while
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
we're transitioning and improving so
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's so it's a multi-faceted dance if
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
you will in in your Department's efforts
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh where are you with uh subsurfaces is
 
02:50:32.090 --> 02:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
a great example of e-permitting and it's
 
02:50:34.010 --> 02:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
working very well
 
02:50:37.010 --> 02:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
um how close are we to or where do you
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
see down the line that we'll get
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
Shoreland which I think would be easier
 
02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
than getting Wetlands but I to have
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
those documents available are equally as
 
02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
important many times in Shoreland and
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could speak to that
 
02:50:53.809 --> 02:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
so I may give over to that our assistant
 
02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner Mark Mark Sanborn I I
 
02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
didn't I think he wasn't in the room
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
when I when I announced everybody if I
 
02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
was I apologize if he was I apologize to
 
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
him I know he is now uh so maybe I'll
 
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
ask him if you don't mind to come up and
 
02:51:08.929 --> 02:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
please Sue can scoot over for a bit
 
02:51:11.690 --> 02:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
he's been uh I I don't know if it's an
 
02:51:13.849 --> 02:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
enviable task or an enviable task but
 
02:51:16.130 --> 02:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
he's been been working with doit very
 
02:51:17.870 --> 02:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
closely in our our team on the the
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
database work
 
02:51:20.990 --> 02:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
thanks commissioner for the record Mark
 
02:51:23.929 --> 02:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
Sanborn assistant commissioner and uh
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
all duties as assigned by the
 
02:51:27.170 --> 02:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I'm happy to do all of
 
02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:28.130 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I'm happy to do all of
them

02:51:28.130 --> 02:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things uh relating
 
02:51:33.410 --> 02:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
back to a number of the questions so the
 
02:51:37.250 --> 02:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
digitalization item on the list that is
 
02:51:40.130 --> 02:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
specifically to focus in on our lrm
 
02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
which the programs you're mentioning are
 
02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:44.270 align:start position:0%
which the programs you're mentioning are
under

02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
um to get those online and accessible
 
02:51:48.650 --> 02:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
electronically versus
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
um in hard form only which is the way it
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
is right now another thing I wanted to
 
02:51:55.610 --> 02:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
mention about that the One-Stop efforts
 
02:51:57.349 --> 02:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to it just being good
 
02:51:59.809 --> 02:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
practice getting those digitized we need
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
them to be digitalized for one stop to
 
02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
fully work because you need those
 
02:52:05.809 --> 02:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
documents your subsurface is a great
 
02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
example of that
 
02:52:09.410 --> 02:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so where we are just stepping back
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
phase one of our current One-Stop effort
 
02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
is Data Warehouse cleanup so we are
 
02:52:18.530 --> 02:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
going through the process of
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
um the Legacy at DES is at the time the
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
way a lot of programs did it is they
 
02:52:26.230 --> 02:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
built their own
 
02:52:30.110 --> 02:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
software using with the help of doit and
 
02:52:33.050 --> 02:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
they had data of their own databases so
 
02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
which was standard practice you know for
 
02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
for a while and across the board what
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now is the phase one
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
is to take all of our databases
 
02:52:46.969 --> 02:52:46.979 align:start position:0%
get all our documents loaded
 
02:52:49.730 --> 02:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
electronically and consolidation of all
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
our databases through Oracle and then
 
02:52:55.490 --> 02:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
also utilizing oracle's iCloud to have
 
02:52:58.490 --> 02:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
them all moved up to to the cloud so
 
02:53:03.230 --> 02:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's phase one which you should see a
 
02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
contract for by July in front of GNC for
 
02:53:09.730 --> 02:53:09.740 align:start position:0%
the the first phase one of the funding
 
02:53:12.230 --> 02:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
we actually just this week we're
 
02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
interviewing the finalists for the RFP
 
02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:16.450 align:start position:0%
interviewing the finalists for the RFP
process

02:53:16.450 --> 02:53:16.460 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:53:21.610 --> 02:53:21.620 align:start position:0%
phase two is then taking the now
 
02:53:25.210 --> 02:53:25.220 align:start position:0%
accessing the databases with modern
 
02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
programs in order to be able to
 
02:53:31.550 --> 02:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
interface with the public so you could
 
02:53:34.010 --> 02:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
start accessing them while we're doing
 
02:53:36.889 --> 02:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
all this I'm sure you're all aware the
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
governor used some of the arpa funding
 
02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:40.670 align:start position:0%
governor used some of the arpa funding
for

02:53:40.670 --> 02:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:42.050 align:start position:0%
for
um

02:53:42.050 --> 02:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:45.530 --> 02:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
um to do some uh efficiency improvements
 
02:53:48.349 --> 02:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
for uh the e-permitting efforts with us
 
02:53:50.269 --> 02:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
and Dot
 
02:53:52.610 --> 02:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so we are in addition working with
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
DOT right now for some examples of some
 
02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
pilot projects using Salesforce as the
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
platform to be able to have those online
 
02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
even faster than the overall effort we
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
have going and the programs you
 
02:54:09.410 --> 02:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned chairman are Are all uh
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
included in in what's being considered
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
sure we're not starting with Shoreland
 
02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
because while simpler than Wetlands is
 
02:54:19.490 --> 02:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
still more complicated so we're we're
 
02:54:22.250 --> 02:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
utilizing some smaller programs to show
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
just the applicability in terms of
 
02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
Permitting e-permitting for Salesforce
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and then with the uh idea of working
 
02:54:32.570 --> 02:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
with the oit and including them
 
02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
Shoreland is on that list of ones we are
 
02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
considering doing through that pilot
 
02:54:39.469 --> 02:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
project with that set of funding so our
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
goal is to get as much online get as
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
much digitalized as possible as quickly
 
02:54:47.450 --> 02:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
as possible get as much online e-pard
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
meeting as quickly as possible but doing
 
02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
it in a way so that the larger efforts
 
02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
we're working on it's all compatible
 
02:54:55.849 --> 02:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
with that and will eventually get to the
 
02:54:58.610 --> 02:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
goal that every governor of the century
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
has talked about of having a single
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
portal that the the businesses and
 
02:55:07.309 --> 02:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
residents of the state can go to and
 
02:55:09.889 --> 02:55:09.899 align:start position:0%
then access the program they need to
 
02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
um and perform whatever work they need
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
to whether it's a permit where there's a
 
02:55:15.769 --> 02:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
back and forth uploading other documents
 
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
and of course paying the fees required
 
02:55:21.170 --> 02:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any any questions Miss
 
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
Sanborn while we have them here
 
02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
do you want to continue thank you so now
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
historically the state has both what's
 
02:55:43.309 --> 02:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
called clean water uh and for those who
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
are yet initiating clean water would
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
think would be something you'd drink
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's actually
 
02:55:51.469 --> 02:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and storm water this is an
 
02:55:53.929 --> 02:55:53.939 align:start position:0%
EPA term uh State revolving Loan Fund
 
02:55:57.490 --> 02:55:57.500 align:start position:0%
and the drinking water uh State reload
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds so we have a
 
02:56:01.969 --> 02:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
baseline historically that we've gotten
 
02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
from from the federal government this is
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know the Congress moves decides
 
02:56:08.950 --> 02:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
how much money that that goes out
 
02:56:14.210 --> 02:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
on their on the base basis uh this this
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
cycle now and for the next five years
 
02:56:20.929 --> 02:56:20.939 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure Bill uh increased our
 
02:56:23.450 --> 02:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
srf allocations that that was a
 
02:56:25.250 --> 02:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which they they decided to
 
02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
flow money to the states and and so
 
02:56:29.809 --> 02:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
there's three pots of money there's the
 
02:56:31.550 --> 02:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
supplemental grants which will basically
 
02:56:35.210 --> 02:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
to take our existing srf programs and
 
02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
plus them up there's a new new pot of
 
02:56:40.250 --> 02:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
money through that process called
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants and there's one
 
02:56:45.290 --> 02:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
also for letting copper line
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
Replacements uh both uh neither the
 
02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminant or lead and copper
 
02:56:52.610 --> 02:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
funds require State match but we do see
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
again we're seeing a significant
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
increase as outlined in the slide for
 
02:56:59.570 --> 02:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
our our Baseline drinking water and
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
clean water srf so so uh you know the 20
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
match that's required uh is is reflected
 
02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
in this in this capital budget request
 
02:57:13.849 --> 02:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
any questions on that before we
 
02:57:16.969 --> 02:57:16.979 align:start position:0%
um one one question if I could so do you
 
02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
have any idea commissioner how New
 
02:57:23.090 --> 02:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fares in that money that is uh
 
02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
that is sent out there for drinking
 
02:57:28.969 --> 02:57:28.979 align:start position:0%
water and clean water I know when we
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
look at the amount of money that New
 
02:57:33.889 --> 02:57:33.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire receives for federal highways
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
we receive the least of any other state
 
02:57:38.809 --> 02:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you have a feeling of
 
02:57:44.210 --> 02:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
where we sit with the feds on this money
 
02:57:47.210 --> 02:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
so so these are the funding for these
 
02:57:48.769 --> 02:57:48.779 align:start position:0%
type of funds out of the infrastructure
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill that we're talking about are
 
02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
formula base so so it's it's a set set
 
02:57:56.809 --> 02:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
for our state so as as I was just
 
02:57:58.910 --> 02:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
reminded so New Hampshire based on our
 
02:58:01.250 --> 02:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
size is a what they're saying is a one
 
02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
percent state so we're getting one
 
02:58:06.230 --> 02:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
percent of it so it's proportional we
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
are in a position I will say not every
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
State's been able to digest these type
 
02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
of funds so they're not all taking them
 
02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh I think we position ourselves very
 
02:58:16.250 --> 02:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
well in the state to make use of every
 
02:58:18.650 --> 02:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
dime the federal money they care to give
 
02:58:20.510 --> 02:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
us so we are well positioned in that
 
02:58:23.570 --> 02:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
respect but the short answer is based on
 
02:58:25.130 --> 02:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
our formula we're taking everything and
 
02:58:27.290 --> 02:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's we're a one percent State thank you
 
02:58:29.210 --> 02:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
so moving to slides oh I'm sorry I was
 
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
there for a question yes that should be
 
02:58:35.630 --> 02:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
02:58:37.790 --> 02:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:58:39.650 --> 02:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
um I was comparing the uh the amounts
 
02:58:42.889 --> 02:58:42.899 align:start position:0%
that you're requesting on uh on page two
 
02:58:47.330 --> 02:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
to what was in your submittal to the to
 
02:58:49.250 --> 02:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
the governor and you've decreased the
 
02:58:51.530 --> 02:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
amounts uh could you explain to me the
 
02:58:51.540 --> 02:58:54.889 align:start position:0%
amounts uh could you explain to me the
difference

02:58:54.889 --> 02:58:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:54.899 --> 02:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:58:58.730 --> 02:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
um it's a timing issue uh when we
 
02:59:01.370 --> 02:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
originally put together our capital
 
02:59:03.889 --> 02:59:03.899 align:start position:0%
budget request it was nearly a year ago
 
02:59:07.070 --> 02:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
and we were given estimates from EPA as
 
02:59:10.490 --> 02:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
to what our base grants were going to be
 
02:59:12.410 --> 02:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
um clean water was estimated at over 16
 
02:59:15.290 --> 02:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars drinking water was
 
02:59:17.570 --> 02:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
pretty close to that the final awards
 
02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
that have come in are significantly
 
02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
below that
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water came in in a seven
 
02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars and clean water came in
 
02:59:28.849 --> 02:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
at a little over 11 million dollars and
 
02:59:32.090 --> 02:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
so that is what is driving down our
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
budget request
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
follow up representative uh thank you
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:59:41.090 --> 02:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
in some cases we find that the believing
 
02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
Federal money on the table because we
 
02:59:45.469 --> 02:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
didn't request a match I assume for what
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
you just said that we're uh we are
 
02:59:49.010 --> 02:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
matching any money available from the
 
02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
federal government yes
 
02:59:52.429 --> 02:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you represent mayor
 
02:59:53.690 --> 02:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:59:53.700 --> 02:59:55.750 align:start position:0%
anyone else
foreign

02:59:55.750 --> 02:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:59:58.670 --> 02:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah again that is our goal is to to
 
03:00:01.070 --> 03:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
make sure our our taxpayers get every
 
03:00:02.269 --> 03:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
dime they can from the federal
 
03:00:02.279 --> 03:00:04.730 align:start position:0%
dime they can from the federal
government

03:00:04.730 --> 03:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
um so the next slide I'm going to have
 
03:00:09.710 --> 03:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh Susan Carlson address but it
 
03:00:11.630 --> 03:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
basically it's it said well she can
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
describe it better so but it will show
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
the impact of the srf funding on on the
 
03:00:15.359 --> 03:00:18.769 align:start position:0%
the impact of the srf funding on on the
request

03:00:18.769 --> 03:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:21.889 --> 03:00:21.899 align:start position:0%
I did is because this request is um so
 
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
far out of the norm for the amount that
 
03:00:25.849 --> 03:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
we normally request for match what I did
 
03:00:27.769 --> 03:00:27.779 align:start position:0%
was put a table together for both
 
03:00:31.130 --> 03:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
Federal fiscal years 24 and 25 and
 
03:00:33.530 --> 03:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
essentially our base Awards because the
 
03:00:35.450 --> 03:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
base award for both grants is the same
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
for both years 11 million for clean
 
03:00:40.010 --> 03:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
water 7 million for drinking water the
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
base award for both is 18 and a half
 
03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
million but the supplemental awards are
 
03:00:48.769 --> 03:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
adding 45 and 49 million dollars to our
 
03:00:51.530 --> 03:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
request and these all require the 20
 
03:00:54.530 --> 03:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
match which is what why our request is
 
03:00:58.490 --> 03:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
higher than we have in past bienniums so
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
in total between Federal fiscal year 24
 
03:01:05.929 --> 03:01:05.939 align:start position:0%
and 25 we're looking at 131 million
 
03:01:08.570 --> 03:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
dollars in federal funds which requires
 
03:01:10.849 --> 03:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
approximately a 26.2 million dollar
 
03:01:10.859 --> 03:01:12.590 align:start position:0%
approximately a 26.2 million dollar
match

03:01:12.590 --> 03:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
match
 
03:01:14.570 --> 03:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
um by our current calculations we have
 
03:01:16.730 --> 03:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
4.4 million dollars of match on hand
 
03:01:19.010 --> 03:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
which brings down our rec cost for the
 
03:01:21.710 --> 03:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
biennium for both programs to 21.8
 
03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:23.150 align:start position:0%
biennium for both programs to 21.8
million

03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:25.490 align:start position:0%
million
okay

03:01:25.490 --> 03:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:01:29.630 --> 03:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me uh representative
 
03:01:32.330 --> 03:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity when we accept
 
03:01:34.250 --> 03:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
these grants from the federal government
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
are we giving up any of our water rights
 
03:01:39.410 --> 03:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the federal government
 
03:01:42.410 --> 03:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
are oversight of any oversight or
 
03:01:48.590 --> 03:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative thank you Mr
 
03:01:52.910 --> 03:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:01:55.490 --> 03:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
question I I'm sorry because I'm new on
 
03:01:56.990 --> 03:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
the committee but so when you say it's a
 
03:01:59.450 --> 03:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
match this is a match by the state or is
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
it a match that the state also collects
 
03:02:04.010 --> 03:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
from local communities it is a match by
 
03:02:08.090 --> 03:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:10.130 --> 03:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
just because there are several new
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
members here
 
03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:13.190 align:start position:0%
members here
um

03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:15.530 --> 03:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
would you mind telling what
 
03:02:17.870 --> 03:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
the percentage is of State dollars to
 
03:02:20.809 --> 03:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
federal dollars for the agency overall
 
03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
having done years on finance I'm
 
03:02:24.650 --> 03:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
familiar but
 
03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:26.630 align:start position:0%
familiar but
okay

03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
I if I'd known you're asking that
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
question I would have brought my other
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
budget book
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
03:02:35.090 --> 03:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
um we are at
 
03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
five for five percent General funds
 
03:02:43.250 --> 03:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
we are at 36 36 federal funds and the
 
03:02:54.769 --> 03:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay if that's I'll move the next slide
 
03:02:59.690 --> 03:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
then if I could yep uh so slide seven as
 
03:03:01.849 --> 03:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
promised is about Dam repairs and
 
03:03:04.969 --> 03:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
reconstruction uh this this uh slide
 
03:03:08.809 --> 03:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
outlines the the two the two major ass I
 
03:03:11.150 --> 03:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
I will caveat that historically we
 
03:03:13.010 --> 03:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
actually asked for a lot more for dams
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
and for those who aren't aware of the
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget we were we were fortunate
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to use some repayment funds
 
03:03:22.969 --> 03:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
from arpa those were programmed in uh so
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
we were able to take 30 million of that
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we we for those who aren't aware for
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
for damn work there's there's over 260
 
03:03:33.530 --> 03:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
dams in the state and we rack and stack
 
03:03:36.530 --> 03:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
the needs of you know depending on the
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
hazard qualification what the damage
 
03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
would happen if you know if they were to
 
03:03:43.070 --> 03:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
fail and the condition and we have a
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
running list of who needs to work as you
 
03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
may imagine a lot of these dams are over
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
100 years old so you know we have we
 
03:03:53.389 --> 03:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
have a lot of needs so we were very
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have arpa money's program
 
03:03:58.190 --> 03:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
to the tune of 30 million for for
 
03:04:00.650 --> 03:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams uh that we're currently
 
03:04:03.710 --> 03:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
using uh and that's why
 
03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
you see a relatively modest request it
 
03:04:08.809 --> 03:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
may not seem modest to you but based on
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
past years it's very modest uh so so I
 
03:04:15.230 --> 03:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
say that so for context and also
 
03:04:18.050 --> 03:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
trust me next biennium we will be asking
 
03:04:19.730 --> 03:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
for a much larger amount again because
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's just because of the need so I just
 
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
want to especially for the new members
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
so in this case we're talking
 
03:04:27.469 --> 03:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
um for the ask here we're talking two
 
03:04:30.830 --> 03:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
dams one is as identified as the Israel
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
River ice dam so that was created uh the
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
the that's ice dam uh
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
just for those who know it's it's meant
 
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
to break up ice dams it's not a dam of
 
03:04:45.889 --> 03:04:45.899 align:start position:0%
of the water uh it was constructed in
 
03:04:49.010 --> 03:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
1981 uh by the Army Corps of Engineers
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
and again contacts was for those who
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
aren't aware when you have an ice dam uh
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
or a buildup of ice that that blocks
 
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
things it actually causes flooding so
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
this was this dam was created in 1981 by
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Army Corps of Engineers to help
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
prevent those those things from
 
03:05:12.349 --> 03:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
happening on uh in Lancaster uh once the
 
03:05:14.690 --> 03:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
Army Corps finished that damn by
 
03:05:17.690 --> 03:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
agreement they turned it over to the the
 
03:05:19.849 --> 03:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
town for operation and maintenance of
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
that uh for many reasons the dam hasn't
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
been maintained and now we have a dam
 
03:05:28.610 --> 03:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
who's who's
 
03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:29.389 align:start position:0%
who's who's
um

03:05:29.389 --> 03:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:33.530 --> 03:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
design was to to reduce and eliminate
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
ice dams since it's not been been
 
03:05:39.290 --> 03:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
maintained it absolutely now causes ice
 
03:05:41.929 --> 03:05:41.939 align:start position:0%
dams uh so since it hasn't been
 
03:05:44.990 --> 03:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
maintained uh our desire is to remove it
 
03:05:47.330 --> 03:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
we had to go through a official uh
 
03:05:48.889 --> 03:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
process for the federal government to
 
03:05:51.230 --> 03:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
deauthorize that and that that came in
 
03:05:55.070 --> 03:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
as of December of 22. so now this money
 
03:05:57.769 --> 03:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
would be to remove that that Hazard that
 
03:05:59.330 --> 03:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's created now
 
03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh this the second so it's not a great
 
03:06:04.990 --> 03:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
story uh this the second uh is for our
 
03:06:07.250 --> 03:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
hydrological uh data collection system
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
we have 32 stations throughout the state
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh this allows uh on the damn side it
 
03:06:17.570 --> 03:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
again to the extent that we can see uh
 
03:06:19.969 --> 03:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
changes whether it's storms or just
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
water levels in general what helps us
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
manage our dams throughout the state so
 
03:06:25.849 --> 03:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
it helps maintain the safety of the dams
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
in our operations uh this is again as we
 
03:06:31.849 --> 03:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
discussed with RIT systems generally we
 
03:06:34.250 --> 03:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot of old outdated hardware and
 
03:06:37.610 --> 03:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
software uh in including cyber security
 
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
hazards uh that we need to to see
 
03:06:41.809 --> 03:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
upgrades here so that that's what that
 
03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
250 000 reflects for this day
 
03:06:48.889 --> 03:06:48.899 align:start position:0%
will will there be more locations added
 
03:06:50.809 --> 03:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
or is it an upgrade with what you have
 
03:06:52.969 --> 03:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
this unless I'm corrected this is to
 
03:06:54.590 --> 03:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
replace this is to replace and upgrade
 
03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
our existing okay
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:01.849 --> 03:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well we still oh yeah I was gonna
 
03:07:07.370 --> 03:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
say uh so then our our last uh
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
additional request has to do which is
 
03:07:11.630 --> 03:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
slide eight uh for those who are
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
following along is for the Winnipesaukee
 
03:07:17.090 --> 03:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
River Basin uh so for again uh for the
 
03:07:18.769 --> 03:07:18.779 align:start position:0%
benefit of the the new members who
 
03:07:21.410 --> 03:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar with us uh we own the
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
state owns and operates uh a wastewater
 
03:07:25.849 --> 03:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
treatment facility that serves 10
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
communities in the in Frank Franklin is
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
the location of the uh wastewater
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
treatment facility we are the only
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
agency Like Us in the state in the
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
country rather that that that has this
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
Enterprise under us which is a little
 
03:07:41.570 --> 03:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
bit odd for us we regulate wastewater
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities and we operate one
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
and and so it's staffed by Des employees
 
03:07:50.330 --> 03:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
um the the Winnipesaukee River Basin is
 
03:07:52.969 --> 03:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
funded by the 10 10 communities they
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
they don't take any general well I
 
03:07:55.849 --> 03:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say I'm sure they'd love to
 
03:07:56.929 --> 03:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
have General funds but they're not
 
03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
funded with General funds uh and uh the
 
03:08:02.450 --> 03:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
the the the funds that go through them
 
03:08:04.849 --> 03:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
are are paid for through assessments
 
03:08:06.769 --> 03:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
user assessments basically for the 10
 
03:08:11.090 --> 03:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
communities so in this case their ask is
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh for replacement of what we call Force
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mains so basically it's the the mains
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
that are carrying sewage uh to the
 
03:08:21.889 --> 03:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
facility uh there's about two two and a
 
03:08:24.530 --> 03:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
half miles worth of of Maine that is is
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
in need of replacement it was originally
 
03:08:30.769 --> 03:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
installed in 1983 uh as you may imagine
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
depending on the soil conditions the the
 
03:08:36.290 --> 03:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
the the steel the metal tends to corrode
 
03:08:38.690 --> 03:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh they're starting to see with the
 
03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
corrosion they're starting to see uh
 
03:08:44.050 --> 03:08:44.060 align:start position:0%
some uh some some uh
 
03:08:44.060 --> 03:08:45.849 align:start position:0%
some uh some some uh
leakage

03:08:45.849 --> 03:08:45.859 align:start position:0%
leakage
 
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
and this is to replace that uh and again
 
03:08:52.730 --> 03:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
as you're well aware uh it's much cost
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness wise it's much better to
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
replace before there's a major problem
 
03:08:58.849 --> 03:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
than than trying to patch when you have
 
03:09:01.250 --> 03:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
a hopefully not in this case but a guys
 
03:09:02.830 --> 03:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
were on Main Street that type of thing
 
03:09:05.929 --> 03:09:05.939 align:start position:0%
so this is what that reflects uh and
 
03:09:08.929 --> 03:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
again this is uh 100 funded by the the
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
project participants
 
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:16.250 --> 03:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
um yes please represent
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh I come from
 
03:09:23.690 --> 03:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
Belknap County and we've just been uh
 
03:09:27.070 --> 03:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
this past recent month or so we've been
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
informed of uh approximately 30 percent
 
03:09:35.690 --> 03:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
increase in our sewer uh increases due
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
to the Winnipesaukee Basin and I'm just
 
03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
curious is this
 
03:09:45.650 --> 03:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
6.7 million part of that 35 percent to
 
03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
recoup it or is that other than because
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be part a large
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance of of oversight maintenance
 
03:09:59.809 --> 03:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
that has been I guess delayed over a
 
03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
period of time as we so I'll start and
 
03:10:06.050 --> 03:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
then sue us yes thank you so so again
 
03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so you're correct uh in the
 
03:10:11.450 --> 03:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
operational budget for for you know the
 
03:10:14.450 --> 03:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
the other committee if you will uh we do
 
03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
have programmed in which what amounts to
 
03:10:20.330 --> 03:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
basically is a 25 increase uh based on
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
past past history and that's primarily
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
reflective of moving water and waste is
 
03:10:28.010 --> 03:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
very energy intensive
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's reflective of which I'm sure
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
you've all seen with your own household
 
03:10:34.370 --> 03:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
bills it's reflective of energy price
 
03:10:37.309 --> 03:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
increases Commodities the chemical feeds
 
03:10:38.570 --> 03:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
that we need and that type of thing have
 
03:10:42.290 --> 03:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
all gone up uh exponentially uh and
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
you're mentioned maintenance so there
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
there are some instances where as I
 
03:10:48.410 --> 03:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know we we like to be
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
proactive in what we're doing uh to save
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
rate payers money uh during covid the
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
the availability units we're still
 
03:10:59.929 --> 03:10:59.939 align:start position:0%
seeing a little bit of materials and
 
03:11:01.849 --> 03:11:01.859 align:start position:0%
contract work to do certain maintenance
 
03:11:03.530 --> 03:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to have done wasn't
 
03:11:05.210 --> 03:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
available so there's a certain amount of
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance that that is
 
03:11:09.530 --> 03:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
embedded in into that that increase if
 
03:11:12.230 --> 03:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
you will also as you're probably aware
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
there the 10 communities have
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives we have a board that
 
03:11:18.410 --> 03:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
that this all goes through and and they
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
agree before these things happen uh also
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm not as familiar with your system
 
03:11:26.090 --> 03:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
you say there's a 30 increase
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay so so that my point is some of that
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
increase certainly would be from our
 
03:11:34.010 --> 03:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
operations but each one of those 10
 
03:11:35.450 --> 03:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
communities have their own collection
 
03:11:38.090 --> 03:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
systems and they that they have to
 
03:11:40.370 --> 03:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
maintain as well as staff that may do
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
that maintenance also and that
 
03:11:45.349 --> 03:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we don't control obviously so the
 
03:11:47.690 --> 03:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
extent that your town has
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
Mains that are feeding us that need work
 
03:11:52.849 --> 03:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
or they have they'll to be blunt
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
materials Etc they have the same type of
 
03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
cost increases if it is 30 that's
 
03:11:58.730 --> 03:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
probably why it's more than our increase
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
because they have their own increases on
 
03:12:02.690 --> 03:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
top of it but that's a guess under 30
 
03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:03.530 align:start position:0%
top of it but that's a guess under 30
percent

03:12:03.530 --> 03:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:12:04.730 --> 03:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that helped or not
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
but I can so did you have something that
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted or added
 
03:12:11.929 --> 03:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
um just so you understand this is a
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget request
 
03:12:16.010 --> 03:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
um we are going to be going through the
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
srf Loan program to attain a below
 
03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
market rate loan for this the
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
communities in the operating budget will
 
03:12:28.010 --> 03:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
not see an increase on this until we
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
finish this project which is probably
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
three three and a half years down the
 
03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:33.769 align:start position:0%
three three and a half years down the
road

03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
road
 
03:12:36.830 --> 03:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
if if I could follow I'm sorry did you
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up yes Mr chairman please
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
so if I understood that what you just
 
03:12:46.490 --> 03:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
said or maybe I misunderstood it I hope
 
03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
um that
 
03:12:51.429 --> 03:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
once this
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
6.75 is done
 
03:12:56.450 --> 03:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
and completed that there will be a
 
03:12:59.090 --> 03:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
charge back to the 10 communities it's
 
03:13:02.030 --> 03:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
part of The Debt Service payment
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the the when it was talking Reverb
 
03:13:06.889 --> 03:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
Basin is a self-funded program so when
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
money is borrowed Capital funds are
 
03:13:11.150 --> 03:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
borrowed and
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
um we repay those Capital funds that
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
Debt Service payment is part of the
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget of Winnipesaukee basic
 
03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
so this is a grant then and not just uh
 
03:13:25.490 --> 03:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
no I guess I'm confused
 
03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
because I thought if we did it at a
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget that it was paid for by
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and not the
 
03:13:36.650 --> 03:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
individual and then what I'm hearing is
 
03:13:39.889 --> 03:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be paid back by the
 
03:13:39.899 --> 03:13:41.769 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be paid back by the
individual

03:13:41.769 --> 03:13:41.779 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:13:45.590 --> 03:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
receivers of this and I thought this
 
03:13:48.230 --> 03:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be the same as if you're upgrading
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
your software system and stuff like that
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
any anything in the capital budget is
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
bonded debt
 
03:13:59.330 --> 03:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
debt um whether it is bonded debt
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
through the state general fund or bonded
 
03:14:04.010 --> 03:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
debt through other funds
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
um there is a and unless of course we
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
receive a Federal Grant in this case we
 
03:14:12.889 --> 03:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
are bonding this we are not using state
 
03:14:15.429 --> 03:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
general funds we are
 
03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
going through the srf Loan program in
 
03:14:19.969 --> 03:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
order to get a better rate than the
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
state treasurer can get
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
um and then the communities as we have
 
03:14:26.690 --> 03:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
um when this loan goes into repayment
 
03:14:32.210 --> 03:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service becomes part of our
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
operating expenses
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
and those operating expenses get billed
 
03:14:38.450 --> 03:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
back to the 10 communities which is why
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner said there's all
 
03:14:43.370 --> 03:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
time communities serve on an Advisory
 
03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:44.170 align:start position:0%
time communities serve on an Advisory
Board

03:14:44.170 --> 03:14:44.180 align:start position:0%
Board
 
03:14:46.730 --> 03:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
we have a 10-year Capital Improvement
 
03:14:46.740 --> 03:14:47.830 align:start position:0%
we have a 10-year Capital Improvement
plan

03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
they they review it they go through it
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
they approve it and
 
03:14:56.330 --> 03:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
so we make sure that the 10 communities
 
03:14:59.090 --> 03:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
are all on board before we even ask for
 
03:15:01.610 --> 03:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
any of this funding
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I could if if you're
 
03:15:05.870 --> 03:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
from Belmont you might want to hear not
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
want to hear this but again this is a
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
well there you go so this project is in
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
Belmont and will be primarily paid paid
 
03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
by for by Belmont ultimately
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
if I could is this this project here is
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
is in our capital budget it's not in our
 
03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
Capital this is we're telling good news
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
is representative you're going to have a
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
sewer it might cost you more
 
03:15:31.309 --> 03:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
so so this might this money does not is
 
03:15:33.769 --> 03:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
not in our capital budget but this is a
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
funded project
 
03:15:38.450 --> 03:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
this this is an additional crust by this
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
department to be added to the capital
 
03:15:40.080 --> 03:15:41.330 align:start position:0%
department to be added to the capital
budget

03:15:41.330 --> 03:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
being requested
 
03:15:48.170 --> 03:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay uh secondly um we were fortunate to
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
get a lot of arpa funds and I know in
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
the county we have several years to
 
03:15:56.929 --> 03:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
expend those monies is is there this
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
would seem to be a qualifying project
 
03:16:01.849 --> 03:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
have you folks expended all of your arpa
 
03:16:06.290 --> 03:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
and could we get a list of what you
 
03:16:11.450 --> 03:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
spent arpa funds on sure so so just for
 
03:16:14.570 --> 03:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
orientation again so we've received 185
 
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars of arpa funds uh for
 
03:16:21.769 --> 03:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
water Wastewater and as I mentioned for
 
03:16:24.710 --> 03:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
dams uh 35 of that is for Dam so I
 
03:16:26.929 --> 03:16:26.939 align:start position:0%
mentioned 30 million for state-owned
 
03:16:30.410 --> 03:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
dams we also uh are this allocation of 5
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
million for municipally owned dams uh
 
03:16:37.969 --> 03:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
and of that the remaining funds we've
 
03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
expense you know we've obligated uh I
 
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
want to say on the order of 90 95 what
 
03:16:47.870 --> 03:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're waiting on uh right now is to see
 
03:16:49.849 --> 03:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
what comes back so what we've done is
 
03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
we've done
 
03:16:53.450 --> 03:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
for the primarily municipality but the
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
water systems or Wastewater systems that
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
we've we've offered funding through
 
03:16:57.120 --> 03:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
we've we've offered funding through
furarpa

03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
furarpa
 
03:17:01.370 --> 03:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
their conditional offers and typically
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
they have to go to futile meeting so
 
03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
where we're offering accommodation
 
03:17:08.090 --> 03:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
typically of
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
arpa grants and srf loans with a certain
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
amount of loan forgiveness my hope is
 
03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
the municipalities this is my commercial
 
03:17:18.889 --> 03:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
realize that this is the best deal
 
03:17:19.969 --> 03:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
they're probably going to get in their
 
03:17:23.090 --> 03:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
lifetime I do expect giving just the way
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
budgets work and and competing uh
 
03:17:29.929 --> 03:17:29.939 align:start position:0%
concerns for expenditures that perhaps
 
03:17:31.130 --> 03:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
not all of it's going to make it through
 
03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
town meeting if that happens and we
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what amount that will be then
 
03:17:37.130 --> 03:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
then there'll be additional funds
 
03:17:39.370 --> 03:17:39.380 align:start position:0%
available to reallocate but right now
 
03:17:42.170 --> 03:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
effectively we revalocated our those
 
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
funds already if you like we do have a
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
report that we produce uh we can
 
03:17:50.090 --> 03:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
certainly send it out to you uh the
 
03:17:51.530 --> 03:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
latest one and maybe a couple weeks old
 
03:17:54.190 --> 03:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
but I think you know
 
03:17:57.230 --> 03:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
the website oh that's true and we'll
 
03:18:00.110 --> 03:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
send a report out by email uh and uh
 
03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
also as Sue mentioned all that is uh all
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
on our website also so so it's anybody
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
can see see those expenditures we where
 
03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
they're going Etc so that answer your
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
question yeah no I appreciate if you'd
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
send us a link but I would like to see a
 
03:18:16.370 --> 03:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
report if we could
 
03:18:19.790 --> 03:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
they um so is is this request your
 
03:18:21.410 --> 03:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
highest request
 
03:18:23.690 --> 03:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
issue number one if more funds can be
 
03:18:23.700 --> 03:18:25.429 align:start position:0%
issue number one if more funds can be
found

03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
found
 
03:18:25.439 --> 03:18:27.290 align:start position:0%
found
okay

03:18:27.290 --> 03:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:28.849 --> 03:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
I like all my children equally but yes
 
03:18:30.840 --> 03:18:33.830 align:start position:0%
I like all my children equally but yes
yeah

03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.030 --> 03:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
so does that conclude your presentation
 
03:18:40.610 --> 03:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
yes it is always or if there's other
 
03:18:42.050 --> 03:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
questions later too obviously we're
 
03:18:43.550 --> 03:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
happy and I think we're coming back
 
03:18:45.410 --> 03:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
Monday for the subcommittee if I
 
03:18:49.190 --> 03:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
remember correctly on Labs yes
 
03:18:51.650 --> 03:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh thank you for
 
03:18:53.210 --> 03:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
your attendance
 
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
soon I'm sorry representing else did you
 
03:18:56.809 --> 03:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
03:18:59.570 --> 03:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
yes thank you could I I just go back to
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
the Israel River ice dam I just had a
 
03:19:05.450 --> 03:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
question if I heard correctly it wasn't
 
03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
maintained correctly so now this Dam
 
03:19:09.889 --> 03:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
that was in there for a good reason is
 
03:19:12.290 --> 03:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
going to have to come out who whose job
 
03:19:14.690 --> 03:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
was it to be maintaining it and is there
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
a replacement something going in once
 
03:19:19.490 --> 03:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's out
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'll go backwards for your question
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
so no there's not a replacement program
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
for this uh it's a long labored story
 
03:19:30.650 --> 03:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
but basically some of the reason why it
 
03:19:32.210 --> 03:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't maintained is it was turned over
 
03:19:33.710 --> 03:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
to the town
 
03:19:36.050 --> 03:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
I believe the town felt the Army Corps
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
should pay for the maintenance and the
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
Army Corps since they turned it over to
 
03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
the town thought the town should pay for
 
03:19:43.429 --> 03:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
it so I think that's really the Crux of
 
03:19:47.570 --> 03:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
why it's it's languished as it has
 
03:19:50.809 --> 03:19:50.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
I can understand how that could have
 
03:19:55.969 --> 03:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
happened but when that happens like do
 
03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
you people go in to sort it out and say
 
03:20:01.309 --> 03:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
no you got to do it
 
03:20:03.769 --> 03:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
again this has been decades uh since the
 
03:20:05.570 --> 03:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
80s obviously so I can't speak to
 
03:20:08.210 --> 03:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
history but uh
 
03:20:10.190 --> 03:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
we our responsibility is to make sure
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
these dams are safe and and don't create
 
03:20:15.650 --> 03:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
a hazard so that's frankly one of the
 
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
reasons why we got to where it is now
 
03:20:19.910 --> 03:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
because we were we realized that due to
 
03:20:21.950 --> 03:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
that atrophy if you will of of not
 
03:20:23.630 --> 03:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining it was actually creating
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
flooding and creating problems which is
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
why we then then we got involved saying
 
03:20:30.230 --> 03:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
look okay this needs to come out we had
 
03:20:31.010 --> 03:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
to deal with the Congressional
 
03:20:32.929 --> 03:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
Delegation to get this these
 
03:20:34.730 --> 03:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
deauthorized since they were constructed
 
03:20:38.090 --> 03:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
by the Army Corps uh and uh and that's
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
why we're here asking for general fund
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget money to remove it so
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
again it's not a great situation but at
 
03:20:45.889 --> 03:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
this point we feel
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's the right thing
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much for your time and
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.250 --> 03:33:31.260 align:start position:0%

yeah

03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
03:34:15.530 --> 03:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
name is William Cass commissioner for
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
the dot with me are several folks from
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
the Department to help answer answer
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions if we get into that level of
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
detail I know the uh book presentation
 
03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
information probably has a lot of
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
information I propose to
 
03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
start high level with with some summary
 
03:34:33.889 --> 03:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
and before you know developing into the
 
03:34:36.290 --> 03:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
details if that's if that's fine with
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
you all and we can get to the level of
 
03:34:42.410 --> 03:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
questions that that you want answered so
 
03:34:42.420 --> 03:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
questions that that you want answered so
um

03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
I think the best page to start is just
 
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
the first page it's kind of the index of
 
03:34:51.250 --> 03:34:51.260 align:start position:0%
project requests
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
and gives a a a high level overview of
 
03:34:59.929 --> 03:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
what our capital budget request entails
 
03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
so uh Department of Transportation we
 
03:35:05.690 --> 03:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
end up kind of with uh two phases two
 
03:35:08.210 --> 03:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
two areas of of Interest one in the
 
03:35:11.710 --> 03:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
general fund which deals with primarily
 
03:35:14.570 --> 03:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
our Aeronautics Rail and Transit side of
 
03:35:17.570 --> 03:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
the house and then the highway fund side
 
03:35:20.809 --> 03:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
side fund 15 which deals with more of
 
03:35:22.990 --> 03:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
the dot
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
our own facilities Patrol sheds salt
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
sheds and things like that
 
03:35:32.570 --> 03:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
so starting at the top of that page
 
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
general fund tend we had initially
 
03:35:35.640 --> 03:35:36.290 align:start position:0%
general fund tend we had initially
um

03:35:36.290 --> 03:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
we had initially put forward an agency
 
03:35:42.050 --> 03:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
request of six identified ranked
 
03:35:45.530 --> 03:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
priority projects for consideration for
 
03:35:47.410 --> 03:35:47.420 align:start position:0%
general fund funding
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
right before uh the um
 
03:35:54.050 --> 03:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
right right before the um
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
submission the governor's office had
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
asked us to prioritize to just submit
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
the the top two
 
03:36:04.010 --> 03:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
so uh you know for the full clarity
 
03:36:04.020 --> 03:36:04.729 align:start position:0%
so uh you know for the full clarity
um

03:36:04.729 --> 03:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:07.849 --> 03:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
the top two are what we presented uh at
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
the request of the governor's office but
 
03:36:11.330 --> 03:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
we had identified
 
03:36:13.969 --> 03:36:13.979 align:start position:0%
um those six as the top priority for for
 
03:36:16.610 --> 03:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
our consideration
 
03:36:16.620 --> 03:36:18.590 align:start position:0%
our consideration
um

03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
so if you turn the page to page
 
03:36:24.769 --> 03:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
um well it's labeled page one but it's
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
form 2A which summarizes those general
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
fund requests and I have to walk you
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
through this because there was a little
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
bit of a
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it was a
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
miscommunication or a misinterpretation
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
of our of our information and what came
 
03:36:42.290 --> 03:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
out in hb2 so the first
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
03:36:48.290 --> 03:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
um the first item is for the uh State
 
03:36:51.170 --> 03:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
match or half of the state match for the
 
03:36:54.590 --> 03:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
Federal Aviation Administration projects
 
03:36:58.250 --> 03:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
so we have we get FAA funds through the
 
03:37:00.849 --> 03:37:00.859 align:start position:0%
dot which go to
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and the in the
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
airports uh typically FAA funds are are
 
03:37:12.290 --> 03:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
90 Federal and the 10 match is split
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
five percent by the state and five
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
percent by the municipality or the
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
airport owner there are a few projects
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
that that uh percentage may change on
 
03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
and there are some
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
um there are some
 
03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:28.450 align:start position:0%
um there are some
um

03:37:28.450 --> 03:37:28.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
lingering uh
 
03:37:35.690 --> 03:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh relief funded projects which were a
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
hundred percent federally funded coming
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
out of some of the covid relief which
 
03:37:42.889 --> 03:37:42.899 align:start position:0%
impact those percentages
 
03:37:42.899 --> 03:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
impact those percentages
so

03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:48.370 --> 03:37:48.380 align:start position:0%
um our ask at the agency request was for
 
03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
1.19 million dollars of state general
 
03:37:56.650 --> 03:37:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
69.64664 million dollars of federal
 
03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
funds for a total of
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh 70 million 857 dollars
 
03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
uh 70 million 857 dollars
um

03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
again this is where the the
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation or miscommunication
 
03:38:13.610 --> 03:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
had come had come from so in the
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget we in hb2 you'll see
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
that uh dot was approved for 7 million
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
87 million 85 807 dollars
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
um again somebody had read the total saw
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
that typically the Federal
 
03:38:35.090 --> 03:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
Aviation funds have matched 90 10 and
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
they put a 10 percent
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
funding level in there
 
03:38:42.170 --> 03:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
so we uh respectfully would would
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
suggest an adjustment down because we'd
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
only needed the 1.19 million dollars to
 
03:38:49.969 --> 03:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
match the FAA funds so adjust the
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
approved level down by the by the Delta
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
there of 5.89 million dollars and with
 
03:38:58.670 --> 03:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
that balance consider funding uh the
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
remaining uh uh requests that we had had
 
03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:03.290 align:start position:0%
remaining uh uh requests that we had had
um

03:39:03.290 --> 03:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
out there
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll pause for a minute there are any
 
03:39:09.650 --> 03:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
questions if that's if that's clear but
 
03:39:09.660 --> 03:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
questions if that's if that's clear but
essentially

03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:11.870 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:13.729 --> 03:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
what we had asked for on this line
 
03:39:16.250 --> 03:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
because of that misinterpretation of the
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
of the matching percentage was was over
 
03:39:21.530 --> 03:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
funded and the adjustments are labeled
 
03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
there so it asked for consideration you
 
03:39:27.370 --> 03:39:27.380 align:start position:0%
know to apply that to the the remaining
 
03:39:31.490 --> 03:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
items that weren't originally submitted
 
03:39:34.190 --> 03:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
and we can step through those and I can
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
stop for either questions or keep going
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
but it's a little bit confusing I want
 
03:39:38.929 --> 03:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
to just take time to make sure everyone
 
03:39:38.939 --> 03:39:40.010 align:start position:0%
to just take time to make sure everyone
understood

03:39:40.010 --> 03:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
understood
 
03:39:42.410 --> 03:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
oh thank you commissioner the way I
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
understand this Committee just found
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
five million 893 thousand dollars that's
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
the way to look at it exactly sure but
 
03:39:51.650 --> 03:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
let's uh let's let's go through your
 
03:39:55.250 --> 03:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
projects uh that you propose to use some
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
of that money for okay certainly so
 
03:39:58.439 --> 03:39:59.210 align:start position:0%
of that money for okay certainly so
um

03:39:59.210 --> 03:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
um so that Priority One again is the is
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
the match for the Federal Aviation
 
03:40:03.359 --> 03:40:06.050 align:start position:0%
the match for the Federal Aviation
projects

03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
projects
 
03:40:09.290 --> 03:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
um our second priority was similarly the
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
match matching funds for uh for Transit
 
03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh buses and passenger amenities those
 
03:40:18.050 --> 03:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
are capital federal uh Capital Federal
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
Transit Authority
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
um funds they go to primarily
 
03:40:26.510 --> 03:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
um you know municipal or community-based
 
03:40:29.570 --> 03:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
Transit providers for replacement buses
 
03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh and Paratransit vehicles
 
03:40:35.570 --> 03:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
um there's more detail in the in the in
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
the um in the
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
um packet for exactly what what what
 
03:40:44.090 --> 03:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
agencies and stuff would get that but at
 
03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
a high level that uh five hundred and
 
03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:52.620 --> 03:41:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
six million dollars or so of of FTA
 
03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:04.969 align:start position:0%
six million dollars or so of of FTA
funds

03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:41:08.450 --> 03:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
um so that 570 000 is just the match for
 
03:41:12.370 --> 03:41:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh roughly
 
03:41:19.610 --> 03:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
30 to 35 uh Transit vehicles for the um
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
for those
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
um Transit service providers in the
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
details further in there thank you
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
the third priority and actually I I'll
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
kind of take three four and five
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
um all all together
 
03:41:34.620 --> 03:41:35.269 align:start position:0%
um all all together
um

03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
because they they they all pertain to
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
um uh some funding to address uh needs
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
along state-owned railroad corridors and
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
we've bucketed it in kind of three three
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
asks of of what what what some needs
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
that have been identified for
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
um addressing repairs to Railroad
 
03:42:01.190 --> 03:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
bridges in the first line that's
 
03:42:03.410 --> 03:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
priority number three
 
03:42:07.030 --> 03:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and a 620 000 request
 
03:42:09.530 --> 03:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
repairs to culverts
 
03:42:11.570 --> 03:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
um under and along state-owned railroad
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
lines which is priority number four
 
03:42:16.849 --> 03:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
in priority number five which deals with
 
03:42:19.370 --> 03:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
a request of about five hundred thousand
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to address
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
um railroad ties uh deteriorated
 
03:42:27.170 --> 03:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
railroad ties along state-owned railroad
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
lines these are basically maintenance
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
type of projects to allow us to address
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
some of the needs and keep up with the
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs along the state-owned
 
03:42:36.910 --> 03:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
railroad lines
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
we have a very small
 
03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:40.429 align:start position:0%
we have a very small
um

03:42:40.429 --> 03:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit division uh and and
 
03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit division uh and and
very

03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:42:45.359 --> 03:42:46.010 align:start position:0%
very
um

03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
limited funding limits that that go to
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
support the state-owned railroad lines
 
03:42:53.150 --> 03:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
wholly dependent on requests such as
 
03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:54.290 align:start position:0%
wholly dependent on requests such as
these

03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you questions yes representative
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill I guess I'm just curious none of
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
this on the railroad stuff can be
 
03:43:08.050 --> 03:43:08.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:10.210 --> 03:43:10.220 align:start position:0%
not um
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
not uh not the formula not the core
 
03:43:15.050 --> 03:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
formula funds and things that we get if
 
03:43:18.110 --> 03:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
there was a special project
 
03:43:21.769 --> 03:43:21.779 align:start position:0%
like uh although it's not our line I
 
03:43:23.929 --> 03:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
mean I think Kathy had provided the
 
03:43:25.250 --> 03:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
committee some information on the
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
Capitol Corridor which was a which was
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to be either an fra or an FTA kind
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
of federal funded project let me just
 
03:43:34.729 --> 03:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
pause for a minute and Shelly do I have
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
that right does yes so worth the shot
 
03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah
 
03:43:43.849 --> 03:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:47.889 --> 03:43:47.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sure and the uh and the
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
sixth priority
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:43:51.359 --> 03:43:52.429 align:start position:0%
um is
um

03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:55.490 --> 03:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
is a is a software system to help us
 
03:43:59.450 --> 03:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
administer our av Aviation grant program
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
um we we rely on a very uh dated
 
03:44:04.200 --> 03:44:05.389 align:start position:0%
um we we rely on a very uh dated
um

03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:07.849 --> 03:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
software program it's a it's an access
 
03:44:07.859 --> 03:44:09.650 align:start position:0%
software program it's a it's an access
database

03:44:09.650 --> 03:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:44:13.010 --> 03:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
um type of type of system
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
um 20 plus years old uh uh it's
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
functional it's stable it's level it
 
03:44:20.330 --> 03:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
works but uh
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
um it's been an identified need to
 
03:44:25.610 --> 03:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
upgrade that to you know bring us uh
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
um into the future here to help better
 
03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
and more efficiently manage those
 
03:44:31.610 --> 03:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
airport grants but um the existing
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
system like I said is stable that's why
 
03:44:35.690 --> 03:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's the sixth priority but it is an
 
03:44:41.809 --> 03:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.769 --> 03:44:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.370 --> 03:44:48.380 align:start position:0%
so if you were to fund
 
03:44:51.170 --> 03:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
items three through six
 
03:44:53.570 --> 03:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh that would still leave a surplus is
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
that the way I understand it
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes I mean answer your question yes
 
03:45:17.210 --> 03:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
because those all total 4.5
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh three 4.5 million dollars and what
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
was approved was uh seven million
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in the general fund side great
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
would you like to continue
 
03:45:28.190 --> 03:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
oh questions I'm sorry
 
03:45:29.690 --> 03:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
um oh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh you might be amused to
 
03:45:33.769 --> 03:45:33.779 align:start position:0%
know that the previous agency also had
 
03:45:35.450 --> 03:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
an access database so I wouldn't feel
 
03:45:38.570 --> 03:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.580 --> 03:45:40.429 align:start position:0%
 
Thursday

03:45:40.429 --> 03:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question those are railroad
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
ties and uh lines really look sad so
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
what's the frequency of use on these
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
lines that that we're talking about
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
doing the work
 
03:45:54.050 --> 03:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
um that's why I have some staff Shelley
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
do you want to help this is Shelly
 
03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
winter she's our director of Aeronautics
 
03:46:00.050 --> 03:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
Rail and Rail and Transit thank you
 
03:46:00.060 --> 03:46:02.030 align:start position:0%
Rail and Rail and Transit thank you
um

03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:03.769 --> 03:46:03.779 align:start position:0%
I'll let you answer I could speculate I
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a general sense but I'm sure you're
 
03:46:07.849 --> 03:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
much more articulate on
 
03:46:09.769 --> 03:46:09.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm much more articulate
 
03:46:13.490 --> 03:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you so there's Federal
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
Railroad Administration safety standards
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
and requirements on how many good ties
 
03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
are required per rail length so right
 
03:46:22.849 --> 03:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
now because we are band-aiding with ties
 
03:46:24.010 --> 03:46:24.020 align:start position:0%
that are all
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
pre-1970s you know I brought a date pin
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is a 1933 date pin we pulled out
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
last week we're meeting the minimum
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
standards and requirements under Federal
 
03:46:35.210 --> 03:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
Railroad Administration guidelines to
 
03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
maintain a class one or class two so we
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
have no safety issues currently we're
 
03:46:41.809 --> 03:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
very diligent about our inspections
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
we've ramped up our inspections to
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
include a rail pod which is sort of a
 
03:46:47.929 --> 03:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
machine that runs on it and can
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
ultrasonically collect all this
 
03:46:51.290 --> 03:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
information and data so we're
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
recommending a strategic replacement of
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
those that are going to change impact
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
the safety
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
and again prioritize based on those that
 
03:47:01.729 --> 03:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
get the heaviest needs so whether it's
 
03:47:04.070 --> 03:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
rail to maintain the heavier freight
 
03:47:06.050 --> 03:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
loads or if it's the tourist Excursion
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
Services of Conway scenic for the
 
03:47:10.010 --> 03:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Lincoln railroad so some of
 
03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
those get daily use during the um the
 
03:47:14.570 --> 03:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
tourist season so again moving
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
passengers were very careful about that
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
safety and then where the heavier loads
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
are there's more infrequent use but the
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
weight is heavier so it's kind of a
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
balance of prioritization so we use this
 
03:47:27.650 --> 03:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
data collected to look at the worst
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
locations or the worst spots and we'll
 
03:47:31.250 --> 03:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
we'll spot Thai replace those
 
03:47:31.260 --> 03:47:32.450 align:start position:0%
we'll spot Thai replace those
accordingly

03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yes Mike represent
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
beggar yeah Mike yeah thank you Mr
 
03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thanks for the answer it
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
should be a fairly quick one it has to
 
03:47:47.809 --> 03:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
do with actually uh line number two
 
03:47:47.819 --> 03:47:49.130 align:start position:0%
do with actually uh line number two
um

03:47:49.130 --> 03:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:51.769 --> 03:47:51.779 align:start position:0%
the federal match you're talking about
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
is there more money available if you
 
03:47:55.790 --> 03:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
came up with more money is there more
 
03:47:57.530 --> 03:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
money from the feds or you're just
 
03:47:59.570 --> 03:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
matching up to what you can get from
 
03:48:01.190 --> 03:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
them now
 
03:48:02.929 --> 03:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
I think we're just matching what our
 
03:48:06.590 --> 03:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated uh funding level uh would
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
would be I think with some of the
 
03:48:11.090 --> 03:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
lapsing projects and stuff if there
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
happen to be more available Federal
 
03:48:15.889 --> 03:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
Transit money
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that the that the
 
03:48:20.450 --> 03:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
that the state match would be a
 
03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
limitation is that correct yeah
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
so they have an equivalent of a capital
 
03:48:28.490 --> 03:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
investment plan so they have a Transit
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
Asset Management plan which shows based
 
03:48:33.650 --> 03:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
on the year of service or the projected
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
mileage when something is due for
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
replacement so they have to access the
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds in accordance with that
 
03:48:43.330 --> 03:48:43.340 align:start position:0%
useful life standard so this is our
 
03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
prognostication of the state funds
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to access those based on
 
03:48:50.330 --> 03:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
federal standards thank you thank you
 
03:48:52.490 --> 03:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes please
 
03:48:52.500 --> 03:48:54.110 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes please
representski

03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
representski
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:48:59.330 --> 03:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
um how many miles of railroad tracks do
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
we own the state of New Hampshire
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
234. so the requests all the requests
 
03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
before you are for the active railroad
 
03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
lines which are approximately 200 with
 
03:49:12.290 --> 03:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
160 of them getting that more regular
 
03:49:14.510 --> 03:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
use so all the requests before you were
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the active railroad lines so that's
 
03:49:19.610 --> 03:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
160 miles
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
correct about 160 miles that have
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
regular Service 200 miles if we look at
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
those that are maybe only used
 
03:49:26.399 --> 03:49:29.469 align:start position:0%
those that are maybe only used
seasonally

03:49:29.469 --> 03:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
are we getting any reimbursement from
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
people who use companies that are using
 
03:49:36.410 --> 03:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
correct The Limited funds that
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass spoke to earlier that
 
03:49:41.690 --> 03:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
the railroad the special railroad fund
 
03:49:43.490 --> 03:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
that we have access to that's generated
 
03:49:45.650 --> 03:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
from a percent of gross revenue by our
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
tenant railroads who use those lines
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
those contracts go through governor and
 
03:49:52.610 --> 03:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
Council and we get limited revenue from
 
03:49:54.889 --> 03:49:54.899 align:start position:0%
a Butters who may have a driveway
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
Crossing across the railroad quarters or
 
03:49:59.090 --> 03:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
may lease ancillary Parcels from us so
 
03:50:00.830 --> 03:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
the special railroad fund and our
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance funds are self-generated but
 
03:50:05.090 --> 03:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
they're limited to those sources I just
 
03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:07.010 align:start position:0%
they're limited to those sources I just
identified

03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:50:09.769 --> 03:50:09.779 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right any any further
 
03:50:09.779 --> 03:50:12.290 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right any any further
questions

03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:19.330 --> 03:50:19.340 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to stay
 
03:50:21.650 --> 03:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
no thank you uh if there are no more
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
questions on the general general fund
 
03:50:25.849 --> 03:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
side I've moved to the divider there's a
 
03:50:28.490 --> 03:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
divider in this book uh a green divider
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
will kind of go to the cap excuse me
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
make sure we can make go to the capital
 
03:50:34.849 --> 03:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
side I mean go to the highway fund side
 
03:50:40.729 --> 03:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.370 --> 03:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
and that's on page 28 so let me make
 
03:50:45.410 --> 03:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
sure so it'll probably be easier to just
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
kind of talk off of this summary and
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
then go deeper if we need any more
 
03:50:52.010 --> 03:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
detail so
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
again a little bit more explanation here
 
03:50:57.650 --> 03:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
um this is a little bit different than
 
03:50:59.809 --> 03:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
the general fund side so
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
at our initial agency request we had
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
identified this this list of 11
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
priorities for consideration for
 
03:51:12.010 --> 03:51:12.020 align:start position:0%
for uh Capital funding
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
at the um right before the June
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
submission uh the governor's office had
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
asked us to only submit or I'll take our
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
our top three priorities to to submit
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why there's a dividing line
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
here between here so those top three
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
priorities for the salt salt and sand
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
sheds underground fuels fuel tanks
 
03:51:36.769 --> 03:51:36.779 align:start position:0%
replacement and the crew quarters were
 
03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
our top three priorities that we had
 
03:51:41.929 --> 03:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
submitted with our official agency
 
03:51:44.809 --> 03:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
capital budget request but our initial
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
agency budget Capital request had
 
03:51:52.809 --> 03:51:52.819 align:start position:0%
included all 11 prioritized needs
 
03:51:52.819 --> 03:51:54.469 align:start position:0%
included all 11 prioritized needs
and

03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:57.190 --> 03:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
um coming out of hb2
 
03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
again because of and I think you've
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
heard the concerns about
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
um you know where we are with interest
 
03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
rates and and things like that that has
 
03:52:10.190 --> 03:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
their their uh there wasn't there wasn't
 
03:52:14.090 --> 03:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
in the governor's uh budget a will to
 
03:52:16.849 --> 03:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
um consider funding for any of our
 
03:52:20.450 --> 03:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
highway-funded Capital needs so that's
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
why uh and the approved side not none of
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
none of these were approved in the
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
governor's official hb2 budget
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
with that said I would like to advocate
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
for our top three priorities
 
03:52:34.319 --> 03:52:35.330 align:start position:0%
for our top three priorities
um

03:52:35.330 --> 03:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that we have
 
03:52:41.210 --> 03:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
found over the years is that if we don't
 
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
keep up with some regular investment
 
03:52:43.200 --> 03:52:45.110 align:start position:0%
keep up with some regular investment
regular

03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
regular
 
03:52:47.769 --> 03:52:47.779 align:start position:0%
um maintenance of these facilities
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
we get very far behind and we have a
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
long list so I know some of all of the
 
03:52:56.450 --> 03:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh probably
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
know this but we have about a hundred
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
Patrol sheds and remote
 
03:53:05.690 --> 03:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
um not remote but but maintenance
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
facilities Patrol sheds around the state
 
03:53:11.330 --> 03:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for maintaining all
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the all of the state highways
 
03:53:13.680 --> 03:53:15.290 align:start position:0%
of the all of the state highways
so

03:53:15.290 --> 03:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:15.300 --> 03:53:16.250 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
we tend to get uh with this level of
 
03:53:22.370 --> 03:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
funding and cost of going up
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the fuel with the um with the salt
 
03:53:29.269 --> 03:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
and sand sheds we tried to do two
 
03:53:31.190 --> 03:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
two to four depending on the budget
 
03:53:34.010 --> 03:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of sand assault
 
03:53:36.170 --> 03:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
shed that that needs to be done
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
two to four salt sheds of biennium
 
03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:41.269 align:start position:0%
two to four salt sheds of biennium
um

03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:43.849 --> 03:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
and and try to keep up with that so you
 
03:53:46.130 --> 03:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
can do the do the math we have about a
 
03:53:48.530 --> 03:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
hundred or more you know Statewide to
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
maintain and keep up and they're all in
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
various ages and years but uh
 
03:53:56.690 --> 03:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
you know my concern uh our concern I
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
should say is that if we don't have some
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
level of of regular maintenance
 
03:54:04.130 --> 03:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
particularly for those items we get very
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
far we get very far we get behind the
 
03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
eight ball and trying to keep up with
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
that level of of of
 
03:54:13.190 --> 03:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
Maintenance so
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
um the first item of our priority like I
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
said usually every budget every capital
 
03:54:20.330 --> 03:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
budget every two years we do
 
03:54:20.340 --> 03:54:22.010 align:start position:0%
budget every two years we do
um

03:54:22.010 --> 03:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:25.250 --> 03:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
um look for for some funding to again
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
keep up with that regular uh maintenance
 
03:54:31.729 --> 03:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
that regular routine of of replacing and
 
03:54:35.570 --> 03:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
acting on those 100 or so Statewide salt
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
and sand shed facilities so this
 
03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:39.889 align:start position:0%
and sand shed facilities so this
um

03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:42.530 --> 03:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
two million dollars would again we would
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate trying to address two two to
 
03:54:48.290 --> 03:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
four sand and salt sheds uh and replace
 
03:54:50.809 --> 03:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
those in the details of the book there
 
03:54:53.450 --> 03:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
are a number of uh priorities within
 
03:54:56.030 --> 03:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
there that we would identify
 
03:54:58.250 --> 03:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
um without turning to the page I know
 
03:55:01.570 --> 03:55:01.580 align:start position:0%
we've identified Northampton uh Lincoln
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have to look at the third one but
 
03:55:05.210 --> 03:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
there are several in a list that we've
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
identified that need to be replaced
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
one of the interesting things about the
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
Northampton shed is um with the
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
replacement of the salt shed there we
 
03:55:17.809 --> 03:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
are looking to also incorporate some
 
03:55:19.729 --> 03:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
cold storage that is at a remote
 
03:55:23.090 --> 03:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
facility which would free up that remote
 
03:55:28.330 --> 03:55:28.340 align:start position:0%
facility for a uh for a Trailhead for a
 
03:55:31.250 --> 03:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
currently under construction rail trail
 
03:55:34.370 --> 03:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
from Hampton to to Greenland the site
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
that we own would be a perfect Trailhead
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
access to that site it would also
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
provide efficiency to have all that cold
 
03:55:44.330 --> 03:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
storage on site and not two or three
 
03:55:45.650 --> 03:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
miles away
 
03:55:47.450 --> 03:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the higher priorities
 
03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
that we've identified with this with
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
this priority number one
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
priority number two is underground fuel
 
03:55:57.309 --> 03:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
tank replacement
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
again at those 100 or so Statewide
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
facilities we have a number of
 
03:56:05.210 --> 03:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
underground fuel tanks for diesel and
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
for and for gasoline to fuel our Fleet
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have worked very hard to stay in
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
compliance with the with the current
 
03:56:12.720 --> 03:56:14.710 align:start position:0%
compliance with the with the current
regulations

03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
and we've done some
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh not only Replacements but a lot of
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
fuel top
 
03:56:21.359 --> 03:56:25.330 align:start position:0%
fuel top
um

03:56:25.330 --> 03:56:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.370 --> 03:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
improvements to stay in compliance with
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
the regulations and this level of
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
funding and this this type of capital
 
03:56:35.090 --> 03:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
budget request would allow us to
 
03:56:37.130 --> 03:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
03:56:37.140 --> 03:56:37.729 align:start position:0%
continue to
um

03:56:37.729 --> 03:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:40.849 --> 03:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
keep working on those fuels fuel sites
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
and and keep in compliance
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm not saying that without this we
 
03:56:49.490 --> 03:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
would we would jeopardize compliance I
 
03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it's that
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's it's that close
 
03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
but but but down the road uh that is a
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
concern that we need to keep up on
 
03:57:00.769 --> 03:57:00.779 align:start position:0%
maintaining these and keep them in
 
03:57:00.779 --> 03:57:02.689 align:start position:0%
maintaining these and keep them in
compliance

03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:57:05.929 --> 03:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
and the third item is a uh a third
 
03:57:10.330 --> 03:57:10.340 align:start position:0%
priority is an item to look at
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
installing some crew Quarters at our
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
Patrol sheds over the past several years
 
03:57:19.550 --> 03:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
we have had findings from the State Fire
 
03:57:22.010 --> 03:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
Marshals office that our Patrol sheds
 
03:57:23.929 --> 03:57:23.939 align:start position:0%
are not in
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
uh compliance again with
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
um standards of of Life Safety and and
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
things like that we have some again very
 
03:57:36.110 --> 03:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
old facilities
 
03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
um they are much more
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
um active uh garage type of things
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
um historically we had to have
 
03:57:49.610 --> 03:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
um lounge chairs or bunks or things like
 
03:57:49.620 --> 03:57:50.450 align:start position:0%
um lounge chairs or bunks or things like
that

03:57:50.450 --> 03:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:50.460 --> 03:57:51.050 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:57:51.050 --> 03:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh and the Fire Marshal's office and and
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
the review of their our facilities have
 
03:57:55.800 --> 03:57:57.290 align:start position:0%
the review of their our facilities have
have

03:57:57.290 --> 03:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
ding dust so to speak that we aren't in
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
compliance that if we are going to have
 
03:58:04.189 --> 03:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
people sleeping there for extended
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
periods of time and periodically during
 
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
some of the winter storms we will have
 
03:58:08.340 --> 03:58:09.229 align:start position:0%
some of the winter storms we will have
people

03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
staying at the shed and trying to get
 
03:58:12.530 --> 03:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
rest breaks for
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
um extended periods of time that they
 
03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
need to have two means of access they
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
can't be you know sleeping in the in the
 
03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
mezzanine or The Lofts or they we can't
 
03:58:24.349 --> 03:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
have them sleeping you know in the
 
03:58:27.410 --> 03:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
garage area and things like that so this
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
funding request is a um is an attempt to
 
03:58:34.010 --> 03:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
address those findings from the fire
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
marshal uh and and make our sheds as
 
03:58:41.450 --> 03:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
compliant as as possible with with with
 
03:58:43.610 --> 03:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
the with those findings
 
03:58:45.410 --> 03:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
and there's more information and and
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
further in the packet that we can get
 
03:58:50.090 --> 03:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
into but uh and again at a high level
 
03:58:52.370 --> 03:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's what the that's what they ask and
 
03:58:53.929 --> 03:58:53.939 align:start position:0%
that the request is
 
03:58:53.939 --> 03:58:55.370 align:start position:0%
that the request is
so

03:58:55.370 --> 03:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:57.349 --> 03:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
um those are our three highest priority
 
03:58:57.359 --> 03:58:59.030 align:start position:0%
um those are our three highest priority
uh

03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
um items that we again not funded in the
 
03:59:04.610 --> 03:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but that we would ask
 
03:59:06.889 --> 03:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
consideration of the other thing that I
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
would point out is that because we had
 
03:59:11.330 --> 03:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
made that request for those three
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
highest priority uh ones our budget
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
submission and The Debt Service in in
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
estimation in our budget does already
 
03:59:24.050 --> 03:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
account for these for these three top
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
priorities so The Debt Service
 
03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
estimation that we've done and put in
 
03:59:32.689 --> 03:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
our budget uh was done in consideration
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
that this
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
request was was going to be was going to
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
be funded in hb2 so The Debt Service
 
03:59:42.889 --> 03:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
should be addressed uh and taken care of
 
03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
for these top three so I'll pause there
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
because I see a question so we can go
 
03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
into some further needs representative
 
03:59:50.570 --> 03:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you Mr chairman again
 
03:59:53.150 --> 03:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
um knowing that we could fund the nine
 
03:59:55.130 --> 03:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
or the 23 million dollars
 
03:59:57.410 --> 03:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
and the net effect of it would be to
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount that we have next year
 
04:00:02.330 --> 04:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
to apply to Highway projects uh do you
 
04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
have a priority of doing these projects
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
versus whatever effect it would have on
 
04:00:13.370 --> 04:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.380 --> 04:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:16.130 --> 04:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the one of the
 
04:00:18.229 --> 04:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
clarifications I I'd like to make is
 
04:00:20.090 --> 04:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
this probably doesn't really affect the
 
04:00:22.969 --> 04:00:22.979 align:start position:0%
10-year plan Highway doesn't affect the
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
10-year plan funding most of the um
 
04:00:28.090 --> 04:00:28.100 align:start position:0%
tenure plan funding is federally funds
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know from past discussions we don't
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
match the federal funds with State funds
 
04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
the impact of of this uh would be on our
 
04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
operational budget our operations budget
 
04:00:43.729 --> 04:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
and and and and the net underlying
 
04:00:46.490 --> 04:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
health and surplus of of the highway
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
fund so it wouldn't uh it wouldn't
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
affect the capital it wouldn't affect
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
the highway program or the number of
 
04:00:55.250 --> 04:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
projects or the projects that we would
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
do in the 10-year plan but it is a
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
balance as we look at these needs and
 
04:01:01.729 --> 04:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
and like I said the underlying
 
04:01:01.739 --> 04:01:03.290 align:start position:0%
and like I said the underlying
operational

04:01:03.290 --> 04:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
operational
 
04:01:05.330 --> 04:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
needs and funding in our operational
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
budget and the underlying health and
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
balance in the highway fund
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Melbourne
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:01:19.130 --> 04:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is in
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
reference to the fuel tanks when you
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
pull the the other fuel tanks that are
 
04:01:25.250 --> 04:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
in there now I imagine they're
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
supposedly steel tanks correct
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
I believe so some of them are the older
 
04:01:32.570 --> 04:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
ones are yes yeah uh are you going to
 
04:01:36.650 --> 04:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
replace them with fiberglass tanks
 
04:01:38.450 --> 04:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
and what are you going to do if you find
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
any of the projects that we've done
 
04:01:46.370 --> 04:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
um you know any of the replacement
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
ending the fuel tank Replacements that
 
04:01:51.050 --> 04:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
we do are in compliance and and and with
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
the with the current standards so
 
04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I believe that fiberglass Dave
 
04:01:57.170 --> 04:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
Rodriguez assistant commissioner can
 
04:01:59.330 --> 04:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
help me but um you can have some more
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
detail I believe the fiberglass but I
 
04:02:03.170 --> 04:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
know they're they're double walled and
 
04:02:05.150 --> 04:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
and and and everything up to the current
 
04:02:05.160 --> 04:02:06.830 align:start position:0%
and and and everything up to the current
standards

04:02:06.830 --> 04:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:02:09.110 --> 04:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and if there is any any fuel tank
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
storage we would have as part of the
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
contract a uh soil or fuel remediation
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
aspect of the contract
 
04:02:20.809 --> 04:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
um typically through our investigations
 
04:02:22.969 --> 04:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
before doing a project we would have
 
04:02:26.929 --> 04:02:26.939 align:start position:0%
identified a a problem or or or a leak
 
04:02:28.849 --> 04:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
or something like that and it probably
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
would have been a higher priority than
 
04:02:34.370 --> 04:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
than this than this type of capital
 
04:02:35.929 --> 04:02:35.939 align:start position:0%
budget request we probably would have
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
been trying to address it on an
 
04:02:40.969 --> 04:02:40.979 align:start position:0%
emergency basis but but with that said
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
um I know we would um in all of our
 
04:02:45.170 --> 04:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
contracts that involve underground
 
04:02:48.769 --> 04:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
storage tanks we do have a um a
 
04:02:51.710 --> 04:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
contingency plan for either contaminated
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
soil or or fuel remediation if it is
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
encountered during the work and Dave
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'll let you correct me if there was
 
04:03:03.050 --> 04:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
anything very good okay if if I could uh
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up to that
 
04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative yes I was going to just
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
ask him one more question when you if
 
04:03:10.130 --> 04:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
you do do this are you going to put the
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
tanks back in the ground are you going
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
to put them above ground
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
want to take that one I've called Dave
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
up so I wanted to have the opportunity
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon my for the record my
 
04:03:23.150 --> 04:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
name's David rodrigue assistant
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of of dot all of our
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
current tanks are underground tanks and
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
our replacement tanks go underground as
 
04:03:32.160 --> 04:03:34.130 align:start position:0%
our replacement tanks go underground as
well

04:03:34.130 --> 04:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:03:36.479 --> 04:03:37.309 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
um

04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
and um I I've probably heard this answer
 
04:03:42.650 --> 04:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
before but can you tell me why we're not
 
04:03:44.210 --> 04:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
using the odd fund for these
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
Replacements remind me why
 
04:03:50.030 --> 04:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
the state's buying fuel right well I
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe I mean we tie into the odd fund
 
04:03:54.290 --> 04:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
to the dude to the degree that we can
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
but um I don't think that the odd fund
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursements that that would be
 
04:04:02.929 --> 04:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
available uh meet the need for the for
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
the replacement but we do tap into the
 
04:04:06.530 --> 04:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
odd fund to the degree that that we're
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:04:12.170 --> 04:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to be corrected but if the
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
if the Department's been under
 
04:04:17.389 --> 04:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
compliance and it is and has done their
 
04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
reports and so forth and the state I
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
will speak from a station owner that
 
04:04:25.010 --> 04:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
went through this and many of my friends
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
have yeah
 
04:04:30.170 --> 04:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
um you know the the liability is only in
 
04:04:32.210 --> 04:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
the matter of tens of thousands of
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
dollars when the remediation can be a
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars so
 
04:04:40.250 --> 04:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
so I could you just explain that a
 
04:04:43.210 --> 04:04:43.220 align:start position:0%
little further do you know Dave yeah
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I fully understand the
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
question what what I can say is we have
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
made use of the odd funds in the past
 
04:04:56.450 --> 04:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
we've also made use of the lust funds
 
04:04:59.150 --> 04:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
which are leaking underground storage
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
tank funds in the past currently all of
 
04:05:06.769 --> 04:05:06.779 align:start position:0%
our sites are in compliance and we we
 
04:05:10.610 --> 04:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
have a proactive plan to keep them in
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
compliance and part of that proactive
 
04:05:17.090 --> 04:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
plan is to upgrade them regularly into
 
04:05:19.610 --> 04:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
change of Tanks be before they're
 
04:05:22.490 --> 04:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
leaking while all of our tanks are in
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
compliance in all of our piping is
 
04:05:27.950 --> 04:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
doubled walled in compliance as well
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
you'll see from some of the pictures in
 
04:05:32.210 --> 04:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
the report
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
um our concrete pads don't all have
 
04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
positive limiting barriers and and so
 
04:05:42.769 --> 04:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
forth many of our pumps are old and many
 
04:05:45.710 --> 04:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
of our tanks are well beyond
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
um their warranty period
 
04:05:50.809 --> 04:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
um and from our perspective the
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
replacement of these sites and we also
 
04:05:56.570 --> 04:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
use this fund for tank top upgrades as
 
04:05:59.450 --> 04:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
the commissioner had explained to work
 
04:06:02.450 --> 04:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
to stay ahead of it so that we don't get
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
get behind in our 96 plus or minus fuel
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
site locations okay thank you
 
04:06:13.610 --> 04:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
the if if I could how where are we on
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
the list of salt sheds we have 100 plus
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
we keep funding for year after year
 
04:06:20.450 --> 04:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
after year that I've been here are we
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
halfway or where are we
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
ballpark all right
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh again that would be an an estimation
 
04:06:32.689 --> 04:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
but we are still replacing many salt
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
sheds that were built in the 70s as pole
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
barns with old utility poles and
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
um Hemlock slabs that we would often
 
04:06:46.370 --> 04:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
mill ourselves back in those days as as
 
04:06:50.510 --> 04:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
we built them and viewed my estimation
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
is fewer than half of our 100 or so on
 
04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
locations have modern salt sheds most of
 
04:07:00.370 --> 04:07:00.380 align:start position:0%
them still are the the older pole sheds
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
and also the way these programs are put
 
04:07:08.210 --> 04:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
forward unfortunately again if we have a
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
hundred plus locations and each one
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
lasts 50 years you always got to replace
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
two a year so this will likely keep
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
coming back from us successors for years
 
04:07:21.889 --> 04:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
to come thank you for that
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
further question representation okay yes
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Cass and welcome back
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
and congratulations on becoming
 
04:07:30.769 --> 04:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you uh the reason I'm
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
your first two priorities for Highway
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
funds the construction of the salt and
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
sand sheds at just over 2 million and
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
the second one underground fuel tank at
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
2 million in this book but I noticed in
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
this Blue Book the capital Improvement
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
they list it for uh 2.5 million for both
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
those items I'm wondering which estimate
 
04:07:55.370 --> 04:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
is more accurate if you've seen the the
 
04:07:59.150 --> 04:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
I apologize I would have to look I would
 
04:08:03.710 --> 04:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
have to look okay because I noticed this
 
04:08:05.150 --> 04:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and I don't I don't know
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
obviously I think you are the past years
 
04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
rather be doing your figures but I just
 
04:08:10.969 --> 04:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
want to be aware of a higher figure for
 
04:08:13.010 --> 04:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
those two items in the blue book here I
 
04:08:15.170 --> 04:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I didn't do my homework
 
04:08:19.370 --> 04:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
and and dig into that uh historically in
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
the past
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
um as we've done our estimates and
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
internally and they get vetted through
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
dis and and they look at them
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
um you know they have some standards in
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
terms of per square footage and other
 
04:08:33.650 --> 04:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
things and and their administrative
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
costs I would ha I would I would
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
I would guess based on on their
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
expertise well we we have the expertise
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
in the salt sheds and our experience
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
with with with with these but typically
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know the building and the capital
 
04:08:50.090 --> 04:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
projects are reviewed by Das and I would
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
know and I would typically defer
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
to the estimates that they had done
 
04:08:57.130 --> 04:08:57.140 align:start position:0%
thinking that they have more of the
 
04:09:00.290 --> 04:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
expertise and would be more current but
 
04:09:03.650 --> 04:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
I can verify you know again those but
 
04:09:03.660 --> 04:09:06.650 align:start position:0%
I can verify you know again those but
okay

04:09:06.650 --> 04:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative I'll come back to
 
04:09:12.769 --> 04:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
Eaton thank you Mr chairman uh two
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh the first one is it uh
 
04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
which is a better value but the the
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
storage tanks back in the ground or
 
04:09:24.349 --> 04:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
putting them above ground because I
 
04:09:26.809 --> 04:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
noticed that you indicated there were no
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
safety sidewalls for leakage and stuff
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
like that on your concrete pads that are
 
04:09:35.769 --> 04:09:35.779 align:start position:0%
in the ground so uh
 
04:09:38.450 --> 04:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
are they being upgraded in the second
 
04:09:42.410 --> 04:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
part of that question uh I have is own
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
the salts sheds when y'all rebuild these
 
04:09:48.290 --> 04:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
salt sheds do y'all put a membrane or
 
04:09:51.889 --> 04:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
something down that captures any of the
 
04:09:54.889 --> 04:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
salt that may migrate into the ground
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
itself and thank you sir thank you yes
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions our current
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
fuel sites are all underground and will
 
04:10:09.769 --> 04:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
continue to to be all underground and
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's most Costa effective for us they
 
04:10:16.010 --> 04:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
they are dual wall tanks a modern tank
 
04:10:20.450 --> 04:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
is is double walled and tested and has
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
sensors inside so that we can notice the
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
leaking we've done cost benefit analyzes
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
to go above ground and for for us the
 
04:10:34.269 --> 04:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
best cost benefit is to go underground
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
and with respect to the the salt sheds
 
04:10:41.809 --> 04:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
they they all do have Linings they're
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
all paved inside they also have
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
collection systems sometimes when the
 
04:10:49.729 --> 04:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
salt's delivered it's wet some of that
 
04:10:52.250 --> 04:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
water even though it's undercover will
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
reach out and we'll collect that water
 
04:10:56.809 --> 04:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
and tanks to prevent protect the
 
04:10:56.819 --> 04:10:58.070 align:start position:0%
and tanks to prevent protect the
environment

04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:10:59.950 --> 04:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:11:02.689 --> 04:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton
 
04:11:05.809 --> 04:11:05.819 align:start position:0%
so in an area that you haven't tapped
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
yet but um possible about a dozen years
 
04:11:10.729 --> 04:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
ago you guys were looking at an RFID
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
system for Fleet Maintenance tracking uh
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
for better management of
 
04:11:19.969 --> 04:11:19.979 align:start position:0%
snow any kind of Maintenance you folks
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
do and to avoid pilfridge uh in fuels
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to have RFID for the tanks
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
for the vehicles and personnel and due
 
04:11:33.769 --> 04:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
to a member no longer here who was a
 
04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
privacy fanatic and always saw an
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
ulterior motive it got trashed on the
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
floor that member is farming and wear so
 
04:11:41.640 --> 04:11:43.969 align:start position:0%
floor that member is farming and wear so
any

04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts of looking at that because my
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
recollection is that it wasn't a
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
horrifically expensive program but had a
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
you speak to that I'm not sure yeah so
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
as I recalled there were two different
 
04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
items that that the RFD RFID tags were
 
04:12:10.490 --> 04:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
were talked about for when it comes to
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
our fuel distribution system and for
 
04:12:16.969 --> 04:12:16.979 align:start position:0%
fuel that the dot uses all other state
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
agencies use many municipalities and and
 
04:12:24.849 --> 04:12:24.859 align:start position:0%
so forth we do have a a very modern
 
04:12:27.650 --> 04:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
system we replaced it in the last
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget and we'll talk about that
 
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the lap State extensions next week
 
04:12:35.210 --> 04:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
we have a very modern system that does
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
have fobs that every driver has to do
 
04:12:38.040 --> 04:12:40.010 align:start position:0%
have fobs that every driver has to do
have

04:12:40.010 --> 04:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
um we also have passwords and key in and
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
we track that very closely by vehicle
 
04:12:49.849 --> 04:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
and then for the dot ourselves sometimes
 
04:12:52.250 --> 04:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
we have to put fuel in a can for a
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
lawnmower we track that very very
 
04:12:58.269 --> 04:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
closely and for for all of our equipment
 
04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
there are in the current software
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
there's different thresholds so if you
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
think takes 20 gallons you can't pump
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.050 --> 04:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newman
 
04:13:16.370 --> 04:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:18.110 --> 04:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at some of these
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
pictures and and back to the Salt sheds
 
04:13:22.370 --> 04:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
that there's quite a difference between
 
04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
on page 33
 
04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
but this this one's driving me nuts I'm
 
04:13:30.889 --> 04:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
45 the bottom picture
 
04:13:30.899 --> 04:13:31.790 align:start position:0%
45 the bottom picture
um

04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
apparently it's in Franklin and it's
 
04:13:40.130 --> 04:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
the combination of salt and sand it's
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently inefficient
 
04:13:43.729 --> 04:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
is is that because there's not a
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
separation between the sand and the salt
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
because it looks a lot better than the
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
45 yeah no I think you're exactly
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
exactly right that that gambrel style of
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
salt shed that you see there in Franklin
 
04:14:08.150 --> 04:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
on on 45 is um is um is an example of a
 
04:14:10.010 --> 04:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
more modern
 
04:14:13.130 --> 04:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
salt shed that we would want so the item
 
04:14:14.809 --> 04:14:14.819 align:start position:0%
that that is a little bit further down
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
on the line that this is referred to is
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
is some cold storage
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
um additions so right now you see this
 
04:14:25.490 --> 04:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
this uh in in that picture there's some
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
there are some there are some concrete
 
04:14:29.090 --> 04:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
blocks and stuff there separating the
 
04:14:31.610 --> 04:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
salt pile from the sand pile and some
 
04:14:33.650 --> 04:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
other gravel and tar and stuff in front
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
there so that that item would be uh you
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
know to uh some capital budget items and
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's further down in our priority list
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
to build some uh some some cold storage
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
so that we could
 
04:14:47.460 --> 04:14:48.290 align:start position:0%
so that we could
um

04:14:48.290 --> 04:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
you know keep that other sand and gravel
 
04:14:53.450 --> 04:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
and stuff
 
04:14:55.729 --> 04:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
you know in a separate Place undercover
 
04:14:58.130 --> 04:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
and be able to fully utilize that that
 
04:15:00.050 --> 04:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
salt shed right now that salt shed isn't
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
being fully utilized
 
04:15:02.279 --> 04:15:03.469 align:start position:0%
being fully utilized
um

04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:05.689 --> 04:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
because of that that kind of cold
 
04:15:07.490 --> 04:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
storage use that's put in there as well
 
04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
too okay just to find so I under
 
04:15:12.060 --> 04:15:14.269 align:start position:0%
too okay just to find so I under
mine

04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
mine
 
04:15:16.809 --> 04:15:16.819 align:start position:0%
the side it doesn't have dividers
 
04:15:20.330 --> 04:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate right for the materials what
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
what what what what we would desire and
 
04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
that that project would be whether it's
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
a lean-to to this or or some separate uh
 
04:15:31.090 --> 04:15:31.100 align:start position:0%
shed type of building to
 
04:15:34.490 --> 04:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
construct some cold storage to to store
 
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
that material in undercover and and be
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
able to fully utilize the uh the salt
 
04:15:43.610 --> 04:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
shed this is being used as a
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
stop Gap measure because because because
 
04:15:49.729 --> 04:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability to store
 
04:15:52.130 --> 04:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
some of that material undercover thank
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
you but yes I mean you compare that that
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
type of uh is that a gambrel my Arch
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
gambrel salt shed to the to the pole
 
04:16:03.290 --> 04:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
barn ones that that Dave had referenced
 
04:16:07.090 --> 04:16:07.100 align:start position:0%
which are pictured on 31 page 31 32
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
and there's a remarkable difference and
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
you can see some of the the the decay in
 
04:16:14.150 --> 04:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
deterioration of the of the polls
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
starting and that's some of the reasons
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we want to keep up with a routine
 
04:16:24.650 --> 04:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
replacement of these older facilities
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions we're
 
04:16:28.610 --> 04:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
running a little long here
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner what else would you like to
 
04:16:32.210 --> 04:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
um well depending on the on the um
 
04:16:38.809 --> 04:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee's uh favorite so I've
 
04:16:41.450 --> 04:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
identified the top three priorities I
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
mean we have other priorities I
 
04:16:46.689 --> 04:16:46.699 align:start position:0%
identified there some roof Replacements
 
04:16:50.330 --> 04:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh new satellite garage and a couple of
 
04:16:54.050 --> 04:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
Patrol sheds historically historically
 
04:16:55.610 --> 04:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:16:57.410 --> 04:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at our capital budget
 
04:16:59.929 --> 04:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
from past years we've always tried to do
 
04:17:02.570 --> 04:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
you know again similar to the Salt sheds
 
04:17:05.570 --> 04:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
we have a hundred or so Patrol Patrol
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
sheds around the building we've
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
typically always tried to do you know uh
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
some some salt sheds and one Patrol shed
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
at least per biennium in this biennium
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
our priority is the is the is the is the
 
04:17:21.650 --> 04:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
crew coordinates in the in the in the
 
04:17:23.809 --> 04:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
retrofit of some of our Patrol sheds to
 
04:17:25.969 --> 04:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
meet those light safety
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
um issues that were identified by the
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
fire marshal but further down on this
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
list there are a a number of um
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
there are a number of priorities that um
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
that we've identified
 
04:17:39.239 --> 04:17:40.189 align:start position:0%
that we've identified
um

04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:42.710 --> 04:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh we are continuing and on priority
 
04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
number four we're continuing uh to build
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
a work order system uh phase three we
 
04:17:49.199 --> 04:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
a work order system uh phase three we
are

04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:17:52.729 --> 04:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
currently finishing phase one and moving
 
04:17:55.610 --> 04:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
into phase two phase three is is at the
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
end for the implementation
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
um which which would which would
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
would help complete that work order
 
04:18:05.689 --> 04:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
System project again representative
 
04:18:07.969 --> 04:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
Newman had noted uh under item number
 
04:18:10.490 --> 04:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
five some of the cold storage editions
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
we talked about those
 
04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
um Twin Mountain
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's the maintenance facility that's
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
that is the that is a remote
 
04:18:22.680 --> 04:18:23.330 align:start position:0%
that is the that is a remote
um

04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mechanical Services uh garage and and
 
04:18:29.809 --> 04:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
Twin Mountain that uh you know has a has
 
04:18:31.309 --> 04:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
a an old
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
um steel roof that needs to be replaced
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
so those are identified needs that that
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
we need to get to and I'm taking us down
 
04:18:40.729 --> 04:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
to ideally
 
04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
um uh priority number eight which would
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
be uh Lancaster and a new satellite
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
garage there so these are all needs that
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
we've identified we would like to get
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
down to i d in an Ideal World we would
 
04:18:55.490 --> 04:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
get down to replacement of a couple of
 
04:18:57.769 --> 04:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
the patrol sheds there
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
um and and represent answer to
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Jack's question it is it
 
04:19:04.729 --> 04:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
is it is a balance we did run some
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
numbers and to fund
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
down to about the length about priority
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
number eight uh the Lancaster uh
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
equate to about a million dollars of of
 
04:19:22.729 --> 04:19:22.739 align:start position:0%
Debt Service
 
04:19:25.010 --> 04:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
um like I said The Debt Service
 
04:19:28.010 --> 04:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
from the first three priorities are
 
04:19:28.020 --> 04:19:29.090 align:start position:0%
from the first three priorities are
already

04:19:29.090 --> 04:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:19:29.100 --> 04:19:29.809 align:start position:0%
already
um

04:19:29.809 --> 04:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
taken into account in our budget
 
04:19:31.680 --> 04:19:33.410 align:start position:0%
taken into account in our budget
presentation

04:19:33.410 --> 04:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:19:35.809 --> 04:19:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh in our in our budget not our budget
 
04:19:38.809 --> 04:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
presentation but in a in our budget
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
um you know getting down to say the
 
04:19:43.969 --> 04:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
Lancaster uh satellite garage priority
 
04:19:45.769 --> 04:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
number eight
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
um would add about uh a million dollars
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
in debt service in the future years
 
04:19:52.319 --> 04:19:53.809 align:start position:0%
in debt service in the future years
um

04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:55.490 --> 04:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
which would which would go against the
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
highway fund so these are needs
 
04:20:00.530 --> 04:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess I'd ask for the
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm not uh I you you all
 
04:20:05.210 --> 04:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
know what other agency requests and
 
04:20:06.889 --> 04:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
stuff are
 
04:20:08.809 --> 04:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
um my senses
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:20:10.439 --> 04:20:12.650 align:start position:0%
from the
um

04:20:12.650 --> 04:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know the current state of things uh
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
if uh funding the top three priorities
 
04:20:17.640 --> 04:20:19.010 align:start position:0%
if uh funding the top three priorities
and

04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
um maybe the next two or three was under
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
consideration we would consider that
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty successful and set us up
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
um for the next couple of years
 
04:20:32.929 --> 04:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
all right and be manageable and probably
 
04:20:35.210 --> 04:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
be be manageable from a Debt Service and
 
04:20:37.130 --> 04:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
impact of a highway fund and be a little
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
more incremental than the full million
 
04:20:41.929 --> 04:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
dollars of debt service that I had
 
04:20:41.939 --> 04:20:44.389 align:start position:0%
dollars of debt service that I had
mentioned

04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
all right have you uh had conversations
 
04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
um treasure be involved on Highway funds
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
we have not haven't
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
the treasurer would be involved uh in in
 
04:20:59.570 --> 04:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
our budget presentation with the debt
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
service for the um for the top three
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
priorities that is and I believe has
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
been vetted through the treasure
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
um the treasurer would be involved but I
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe those discussions
 
04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
um I only bring that up because you said
 
04:21:14.330 --> 04:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's only another million dollars right
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
that's I'd like to hear some and I'm
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
making no promises here sure yeah but I
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
I think that would be if you could get
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
that conversation handled and get back
 
04:21:27.290 --> 04:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
to me I'd appreciate it understood right
 
04:21:29.450 --> 04:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
okay and I didn't mean to imply to only
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
a million dollars I I I I I hesitate to
 
04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
bring that it's a question that I asked
 
04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
as we were looking at these needs you
 
04:21:37.610 --> 04:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
know what is the financial impact from a
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
Debt Service of that I fully appreciate
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
it I didn't mean it to be I I'd figured
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
it'd be like a conversation I had with
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
no I I fully appreciate that is is there
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything else at this point
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like to bring before us
 
04:21:57.889 --> 04:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
um anything on your own Lines no no I
 
04:21:59.330 --> 04:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee's uh
 
04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
consideration and and and reviewing
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
these I know even the top three
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
priorities that weren't um included in
 
04:22:08.210 --> 04:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget uh I do appreciate
 
04:22:09.769 --> 04:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
the committee's consideration of those
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
requests thank you and could I just uh a
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
sidebar item
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I had a I was at a meeting with a
 
04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
presentation from uh University of Maine
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
Orono and they are doing I appears to me
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably you know old technology to
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
you but 3D rendering of uh iron
 
04:22:36.050 --> 04:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
poly girders for Bridges and I
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
understand that they're going to start
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
trying that in Maine
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed to me two things
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice if the university
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
system was working cooperatively even
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
more with your department and
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know is is that something that's
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
even being thought of by the department
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to spend a lot of time
 
04:22:59.570 --> 04:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes the uh the UMaine
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
Orono has a has a regional
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh Transportation that's not
 
04:23:06.170 --> 04:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
a transportation center but a
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
transportation research area there um
 
04:23:11.450 --> 04:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
when it opened a few years ago we were
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
in attendance and we uh you know
 
04:23:15.429 --> 04:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
regularly participate in some of those
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh and some of those efforts um we have
 
04:23:20.689 --> 04:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
close relationships with our um
 
04:23:24.590 --> 04:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
counterparts in in Maine and I know
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about uh we
 
04:23:27.239 --> 04:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about uh we
have

04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:23:28.080 --> 04:23:28.729 align:start position:0%
have
um

04:23:28.729 --> 04:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:30.729 --> 04:23:30.739 align:start position:0%
seen those at various
 
04:23:34.250 --> 04:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
conferences and presentations the uh the
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
the the the company that that is
 
04:23:39.050 --> 04:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
involved with doing doing those
 
04:23:41.090 --> 04:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
um had also been involved with some
 
04:23:41.100 --> 04:23:41.870 align:start position:0%
um had also been involved with some
other

04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
um other Innovative type of bridge
 
04:23:48.050 --> 04:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
bridge building techniques I don't know
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
if you've ever heard of bridge in a
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
backpack was one of their ones with some
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
poly poly-filled um some concrete filled
 
04:23:57.060 --> 04:23:59.269 align:start position:0%
poly poly-filled um some concrete filled
uh

04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
tubes and things like that so short
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer is uh yes we are involved in
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
looking at those and
 
04:24:06.720 --> 04:24:07.610 align:start position:0%
looking at those and
um

04:24:07.610 --> 04:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can take advantage of of
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
those I know there was one proposal for
 
04:24:15.650 --> 04:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
a bridge of municipals a municipal uh
 
04:24:18.050 --> 04:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
one of the state aid Bridge projects in
 
04:24:18.060 --> 04:24:19.370 align:start position:0%
one of the state aid Bridge projects in
Lebanon

04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
um that the consultant had come and
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
approached us if we would uh
 
04:24:26.689 --> 04:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
if we would entertain that that that
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
idea for that uh for that project and we
 
04:24:31.130 --> 04:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
said certainly it would be a good
 
04:24:33.650 --> 04:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
project to see so it is on the horizon
 
04:24:36.050 --> 04:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
on the state-owned structures we tend to
 
04:24:36.060 --> 04:24:37.010 align:start position:0%
on the state-owned structures we tend to
be

04:24:37.010 --> 04:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
more conservative and and look for more
 
04:24:43.969 --> 04:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
tried and tested technology but um
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's not too long of an
 
04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
answer no that's fine thank you
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for the question Mr
 
04:34:39.890 --> 04:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the Virtua trainer is a
 
04:34:39.900 --> 04:34:41.051 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the Virtua trainer is a
um

04:34:41.051 --> 04:34:41.061 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
a very expensive simulating uh simulator
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
device that allows the officers to
 
04:34:48.840 --> 04:34:49.869 align:start position:0%
device that allows the officers to
um

04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:55.609 --> 04:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
be placed in scenarios where their uh
 
04:35:00.769 --> 04:35:00.779 align:start position:0%
weapons can be used to respond if they
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
choose that that's an appropriate
 
04:35:05.631 --> 04:35:05.641 align:start position:0%
response and that device will allow the
 
04:35:07.131 --> 04:35:07.141 align:start position:0%
officers to measure whether they made
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
the right decision and whether they're
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
the use of their weapons were accurate
 
04:35:14.209 --> 04:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
sounds good sounds important uh we use
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
one here yeah we uh so we put it inside
 
04:35:20.330 --> 04:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
a building yes sir but now we're going
 
04:35:22.609 --> 04:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
to take it out of the building and we're
 
04:35:25.849 --> 04:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
going to put it in an outside and make
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
some adjustments to the outside
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
so that it can work there also
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
so uh we presently have two existing uh
 
04:35:40.730 --> 04:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
garages that are uh Standalone garages
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
on our property we're going to take one
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
of those garages and uh finish it off
 
04:35:48.529 --> 04:35:48.539 align:start position:0%

presentation pack packet that you have
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
here on page two the first project
 
04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
that's funded in a house bill 25 is to
 
04:42:15.890 --> 04:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
replace the state's message platform
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's a 1.3 million dollar request this
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
is a piece of hardware and software that
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
passes information between all the
 
04:42:24.890 --> 04:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
different members of the criminal
 
04:42:24.900 --> 04:42:26.410 align:start position:0%
different members of the criminal
justice

04:42:26.410 --> 04:42:26.420 align:start position:0%
justice
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
system in the state and including
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
federal state and local entities
 
04:42:34.128 --> 04:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
so inbound and outbound queries occur
 
04:42:36.530 --> 04:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
for the national instant criminal
 
04:42:38.570 --> 04:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
background check system Interstate
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%

the court system and local and County
 
04:43:00.770 --> 04:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement if you look at page
 
04:43:02.690 --> 04:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
three page three is a good graphic to
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
kind of show exactly how this system
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
works and what we're talking about the
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
green cloud in the center that's the
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
message platform switch and it's really
 
04:43:13.490 --> 04:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
connecting all of these different
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
systems all of these different databases
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
and users so that the criminal justice
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
system can operate effectively in a
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:28.128 --> 04:43:28.138 align:start position:0%
the second project that's funded on page
 
04:43:28.138 --> 04:43:30.350 align:start position:0%
the second project that's funded on page
four

04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
are improvements to the state police
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
helicopter it's 1.5 million dollars
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
worth of improvements
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
State Police operates a Bell 407
 
04:43:41.690 --> 04:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
helicopter that includes a FLIR camera
 
04:43:43.490 --> 04:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
and mapping software that was last
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
updated in 2016. and that system is
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
approaching end of life and needs to be
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
updated and upgraded to continue to
 
04:43:54.410 --> 04:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
operate safely the service is utilized
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
by the helicopter include search and
 
04:43:58.970 --> 04:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
rescue support for SWOT calls crime
 
04:44:01.788 --> 04:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
scene reconstruction photography and
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
then also support for major disaster
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
scenes and storm damage assessments
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
and so these improvements would update
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
the camera itself also update the
 
04:44:13.490 --> 04:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
mapping Mission computer that's used
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
during flights and we'd also have some
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
updated flight equipment for the pilots
 
04:44:21.650 --> 04:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
including and the flight and the
 
04:44:23.570 --> 04:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
Troopers who go along on the flights
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's white phosphorus night vision
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
goggles helmets with counterbalance for
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:36.770 --> 04:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
noise canceling headsets and then flight
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
suits jackets gloves and boots
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
on page five there are some photographs
 
04:44:45.170 --> 04:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
of the existing uh helicopter uh the
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
cabins on the top left the cockpits
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
being shown on the bottom left and then
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
the mission computer which is used by
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
the fto the flight terminal operator is
 
04:44:56.030 --> 04:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
shown on the right and that's what
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
really combines the images from the
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
camera so that action can be taken
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
those are the two projects that are
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
currently included in house bill 25. we
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
do have one additional request which is
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
not included and that's an update to the
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
DMV document scanning system
 
04:45:20.570 --> 04:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
currently the DMV utilizes microfilm to
 
04:45:23.208 --> 04:45:23.218 align:start position:0%
Archive documents
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that microfilm is
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
quickly becoming obsolete the equipment
 
04:45:30.368 --> 04:45:30.378 align:start position:0%
that we have is failing and is regularly
 
04:45:33.288 --> 04:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
it's challenging to maintain at this
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
point and find parts to keep it running
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
most recently it's been a challenge to
 
04:45:40.910 --> 04:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
find a vendors who are able to develop
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
microfilm we had an RFP that actually
 
04:45:45.530 --> 04:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
just went out and came back with zero
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
responses so this is something that's
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
critical at this point that needs to be
 
04:45:52.010 --> 04:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
addressed we're seeking a million
 
04:45:54.948 --> 04:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
dollars to implement an a digital
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
scanning solution that would include
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
indexing of documents to align with the
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
existing driving Vision driver licensing
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
and registration systems and ensure that
 
04:46:06.770 --> 04:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
we can align those documents to the
 
04:46:08.448 --> 04:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
drivers and and the vehicles that they
 
04:46:11.930 --> 04:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:14.690 --> 04:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
page seven shows some photographs of the
 
04:46:16.368 --> 04:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
current equipment that are being used to
 
04:46:18.890 --> 04:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
scan these documents on the top left
 
04:46:20.690 --> 04:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
that's the microfilm image capture
 
04:46:22.490 --> 04:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
machine you can see the pages get pulled
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
through and photographed through that
 
04:46:27.610 --> 04:46:27.620 align:start position:0%
unit Circa 1993-94
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
bottom left is a developed microfilm
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
spool which is read by the reader on the
 
04:46:34.550 --> 04:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
top right
 
04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh and then just an example of the the
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
microfilm that's ready to be read that
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:47.208 --> 04:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
page eight is a summary of the request
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
that we just spoke about to projects
 
04:46:51.170 --> 04:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
funded in House Bill 25 for a total of
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars and then the
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
additional request that we're asking the
 
04:46:57.770 --> 04:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
committee to consider today which is
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
another million dollars for the DMV
 
04:47:02.448 --> 04:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
document scanning updates
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.570 --> 04:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
we do have a lapse extension request
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
related to the state police Hangar so
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
this was a project that was funded as a
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
joint project with military Affairs and
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services
 
04:47:19.560 --> 04:47:20.330 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services
um

04:47:20.330 --> 04:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
it was a combination of federal and
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
general funds many of the members on
 
04:47:26.448 --> 04:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
this committee Might Recall we had
 
04:47:28.250 --> 04:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
challenges in building that and finding
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
fire suppression that would be suitable
 
04:47:33.170 --> 04:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
on the federal side which caused delays
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
on our state side the state doesn't have
 
04:47:37.250 --> 04:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
to follow Federal DOD regulations for
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
fire suppression which caused delays in
 
04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
the project so this committee with
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Graham's assistance
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
helped us to reallocate those funds to
 
04:47:48.770 --> 04:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
State Police so we could move forward
 
04:47:50.170 --> 04:47:50.180 align:start position:0%
with the new
 
04:47:53.330 --> 04:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
Hangar project unfortunately prices have
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
increased since that time and we're now
 
04:47:56.810 --> 04:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
in a position that the new Hangar
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
project would be approximately four
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars to complete so the 2.4
 
04:48:03.250 --> 04:48:03.260 align:start position:0%
million that we have is not sufficient
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
we've done some work we've working with
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
public works and determined that we can
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
renovate the existing Hangar with the
 
04:48:11.448 --> 04:48:11.458 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that we have but in order
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
to do so we would need to have the lapse
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
extension language change to include
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
renovation as an option and so that's
 
04:48:19.550 --> 04:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
what we'd request the committee to do to
 
04:48:20.930 --> 04:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
authorize the change that it's listed
 
04:48:23.810 --> 04:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
here to add renovation to the language
 
04:48:25.690 --> 04:48:25.700 align:start position:0%
in the labs extensions
 
04:48:28.250 --> 04:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm sure Mr Shea
 
04:48:30.050 --> 04:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
will correct me if I'm wrong you have to
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
actually go back and amend the original
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the new language and
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
then extend it through the years that it
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
was extended it's not sufficient just to
 
04:48:44.930 --> 04:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
if so that's what we'll do then that
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be the request that we would make
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what we'll do uh you have
 
04:48:52.368 --> 04:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
three other
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
uh extensions those are all valid and
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there's nothing else
 
04:48:58.730 --> 04:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
that needs to be changed uh correct
 
04:49:00.288 --> 04:49:00.298 align:start position:0%
those are all valid as is they're all
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
necessary to complete the projects and
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
uh We've we have submitted
 
04:49:06.890 --> 04:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
um a response to the subcommittee uh
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
with additional details related to each
 
04:49:10.368 --> 04:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:49:13.010 --> 04:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Mills thank you Mr
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
chair um correct me if I'm wrong I'm
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
maybe uh because I remember going
 
04:49:19.250 --> 04:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
through all this about the hangar
 
04:49:21.288 --> 04:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
because I co-sponsored a bill with
 
04:49:23.570 --> 04:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Graham wasn't this
 
04:49:25.368 --> 04:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a joint hanger between
 
04:49:26.810 --> 04:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
you and the military isn't there
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
military money involved in this there
 
04:49:32.570 --> 04:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
was originally and because of the
 
04:49:33.948 --> 04:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
challenges that we face with the fire
 
04:49:35.930 --> 04:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
suppression systems
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the action that was taken during the
 
04:49:40.010 --> 04:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
last session was to split the funding so
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
the state funding came to State Police
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the federal funding stayed with um
 
04:49:48.490 --> 04:49:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm hearing is that
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to renovate your old Hangar
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
and we can still expect the military to
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
come back looking for their new
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
helicopter hanger you're gonna we won't
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
you won't know that
 
04:50:02.208 --> 04:50:02.218 align:start position:0%
without a question would you believe
 
04:50:04.128 --> 04:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:50:06.530 --> 04:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions yes
 
04:50:08.570 --> 04:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you and one
 
04:50:10.128 --> 04:50:10.138 align:start position:0%
other question on
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
page six uh you have the source of funds
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the million as 100 cost of
 
04:50:17.708 --> 04:50:17.718 align:start position:0%
collections I don't quite understand
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh if that's in other funds or a general
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
funds to be reimbursed or what the
 
04:50:25.010 --> 04:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
source of funds for this actually is
 
04:50:27.288 --> 04:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
sure so that's that's another funds
 
04:50:27.298 --> 04:50:28.610 align:start position:0%
sure so that's that's another funds
category

04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:50:31.010 --> 04:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
um it's actually Highway funds before
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
those revenues are deposited into the
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.850 --> 04:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
so if I could so if if that if this if
 
04:50:51.170 --> 04:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
we were to include that one million
 
04:50:53.930 --> 04:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
dollars then the one million dollars is
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the highway fund
 
04:50:58.270 --> 04:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
and is that what you're saying and then
 
04:51:01.490 --> 04:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
proceeds or Pro monies as you collect
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
them what will go against that
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
so the the the payments any Debt Service
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of this would be essentially
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
from Highway fund revenues
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
but the State Constitution Article 6A
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then also rsa99 requires us to cover
 
04:51:22.610 --> 04:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
any costs associated with those
 
04:51:24.530 --> 04:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
collections before those monies get
 
04:51:26.810 --> 04:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
deposited and so that's what this would
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
be paid for it's it's DMV Appropriations
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
are considered Costa collections even
 
04:51:33.650 --> 04:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
though they're derived from that same
 
04:51:35.690 --> 04:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
source of funds that same Revenue
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
collection that ends up in the highway
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
fund okay
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative I'll come back just
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
one quick one that affects everybody in
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
here for regular ongoing questions on
 
04:51:52.128 --> 04:51:52.138 align:start position:0%
the 1.349 million
 
04:51:52.138 --> 04:51:53.448 align:start position:0%
the 1.349 million
um

04:51:53.448 --> 04:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
does the new switch replacement
 
04:51:59.690 --> 04:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
expedite or assist in any way the
 
04:52:02.350 --> 04:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
background checks that we hear about
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
constantly from all the various sources
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
of taking so long to get done will it
 
04:52:10.250 --> 04:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
expedite the process at all
 
04:52:13.610 --> 04:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
I would like to say yes but I I know I
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
think what I think I think what you hear
 
04:52:19.128 --> 04:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
is you know the check is a check the
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
automation this this is the system I
 
04:52:24.170 --> 04:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
think what you hear with delays is more
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
the entire process of the background
 
04:52:29.090 --> 04:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
checks but um
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
this this in and of itself this the
 
04:52:34.850 --> 04:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
checks that are being run today are the
 
04:52:36.530 --> 04:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
checks that are being run
 
04:52:38.448 --> 04:52:38.458 align:start position:0%
with this new equipment
 
04:52:40.850 --> 04:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you it is still the same transfer
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
receipt of information
 
04:52:48.288 --> 04:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.368 --> 04:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
but do just following up on it so how is
 
04:52:57.770 --> 04:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
it is the is the data that is going into
 
04:53:03.288 --> 04:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
the system for example the background
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:53:15.770 --> 04:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
So when you say a background check so if
 
04:53:17.810 --> 04:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
you're asking if somebody's running a
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
criminal history check yeah no matter
 
04:53:22.368 --> 04:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
what it is it is all being you know it's
 
04:53:24.530 --> 04:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
in like if you look at this information
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's in criminal history or
 
04:53:28.250 --> 04:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
information that's in the triple I all
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
the federal indexes when they are
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
putting in a name and date of birth they
 
04:53:35.208 --> 04:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
will get those checks run automatically
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that is how that is a query how a
 
04:53:40.850 --> 04:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
check is being done against a database
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
when you're asking for the background
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
checks whether it's for employment or
 
04:53:49.128 --> 04:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
there are different layers in that part
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
of a background check might be to run
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
the criminal history the other might be
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
other requirements of the employers so
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is it is all if you look at all the
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and the you know and
 
04:54:03.770 --> 04:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
everything yeah all of the exchange of
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
information if you look at all the state
 
04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
agencies and the courts and Corrections
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's part of it but but
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking about a background check
 
04:54:16.010 --> 04:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
so I to I think I would have to know
 
04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
what type of check are you asking for
 
04:54:21.170 --> 04:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay let me let me try it again
 
04:54:24.170 --> 04:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know where I read it but there
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
was concern somewhere and and something
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
that and I believe it had to do with the
 
04:54:33.410 --> 04:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
NCIS information that information was
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
available but it for whatever reason it
 
04:54:40.368 --> 04:54:40.378 align:start position:0%
just wasn't getting inputted into the
 
04:54:42.288 --> 04:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
systems for background checks for
 
04:54:45.288 --> 04:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
example so I don't know if that's
 
04:54:47.448 --> 04:54:47.458 align:start position:0%
something that you're taking care of so
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
all this information I certainly support
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
updating so it can get put in I just
 
04:54:54.770 --> 04:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
want to know if it's people putting it
 
04:54:54.780 --> 04:54:55.670 align:start position:0%
want to know if it's people putting it
in

04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you have people to input data or oh
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
yes well a lot of it's electronic like
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
the information's transferred a
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
conviction would be transferred from the
 
04:55:07.550 --> 04:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
court to the criminal history and
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
imported electronically so this this
 
04:55:12.890 --> 04:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
really is uh the foundation of the
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
entire you know system so when you say
 
04:55:16.970 --> 04:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
this is the switch the state message
 
04:55:18.530 --> 04:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
platform for the exchange of information
 
04:55:18.540 --> 04:55:20.590 align:start position:0%
platform for the exchange of information
but

04:55:20.590 --> 04:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
but if you're at like for convictions
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of this and that's the goal
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
with this is to get it all put in
 
04:55:26.878 --> 04:55:28.010 align:start position:0%
with this is to get it all put in
electronically

04:55:28.010 --> 04:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
04:55:30.350 --> 04:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
so from a conviction into the system
 
04:55:33.530 --> 04:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
into the our criminal history and then
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
upload it to the federal authorities so
 
04:55:39.368 --> 04:55:39.378 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton then back just so
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's follow-ups you know where I was
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
going well we get on an ongoing basis is
 
04:55:48.288 --> 04:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
from counties and for municipalities of
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
the length of time it takes and how it
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
puts constraints on the localities for
 
04:55:57.170 --> 04:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
background checks for nurses teachers
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
for being luck of the draw
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
no matter who says what about anything
 
04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
you get the blame right so I I will just
 
04:56:10.368 --> 04:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
say this I can speak for um for the team
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
that are involved in our portion our
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
requirement of this process and the
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
process is different depending on you
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
know where the request comes from they
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
are doing everything they can to
 
04:56:24.890 --> 04:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
expedite this and um and put the
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
resources in place to to get it done as
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible we've done a lot
 
04:56:31.730 --> 04:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
over the past year at the um the team
 
04:56:34.730 --> 04:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
over there to to educate and make sure
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
and we've worked together with the other
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
state agencies oplc you know we'll work
 
04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
close with them to ensure that when
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
someone says this is this is delayed
 
04:56:45.890 --> 04:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
well where is it what is it so
 
04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
um but this is critical
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
um to to all background checks to to
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
essentially anything in the law
 
04:56:54.610 --> 04:56:54.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement community
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I'll come back
 
04:57:02.510 --> 04:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
this system is it for public use for
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
background checks or is it just for uh
 
04:57:10.730 --> 04:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
city and state type background checks
 
04:57:13.610 --> 04:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
well this well this system if you if you
 
04:57:16.850 --> 04:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
look at page three you will see you know
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
who it connects and what information is
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
inbound and outbound but
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
um to keep it at 30 000 feet this is
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
really law enforcement this is the
 
04:57:28.128 --> 04:57:28.138 align:start position:0%
switch for law enforcement that
 
04:57:32.690 --> 04:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.090 --> 04:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
represent Kaczynski
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you um how how big is this um
 
04:57:44.208 --> 04:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
this hanger anyway and why it seems kind
 
04:57:46.550 --> 04:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
of expensive to me what would justify
 
04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
that kind of cost
 
04:57:50.330 --> 04:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
I think director Lavoy could give you a
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
history of where it is what it's
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
comprised and what the plan is to get it
 
04:57:56.448 --> 04:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
you know up to spec and something that
 
04:57:57.650 --> 04:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
we can use
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
um to to support the division of State
 
04:58:00.480 --> 04:58:01.970 align:start position:0%
um to to support the division of State
Police

04:58:01.970 --> 04:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
Police
 
04:58:05.110 --> 04:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
so the existing hanger is about
 
04:58:07.850 --> 04:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
6400 square feet
 
04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
um we when we originally were looking at
 
04:58:11.100 --> 04:58:12.890 align:start position:0%
um we when we originally were looking at
Renovations

04:58:12.890 --> 04:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
Renovations
 
04:58:14.810 --> 04:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
um the cost the estimated cost for
 
04:58:18.530 --> 04:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
renovation was about 1.2 1.3 million and
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
that was five years ago so with cost
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
escalations we do believe that this
 
04:58:28.368 --> 04:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
amount is is needed for that we're
 
04:58:31.970 --> 04:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
talking a full full-scale renovation we
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
need new HVAC system we need to entirely
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
gut the
 
04:58:40.010 --> 04:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the current office space interior
 
04:58:42.770 --> 04:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
rebuild that we need to install a water
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
curtain fire suppression system because
 
04:58:47.590 --> 04:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
it is still an aircraft
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
Hangar to protect the the individuals
 
04:58:54.128 --> 04:58:54.138 align:start position:0%
who are working out of that space
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
and then replace the roof and also if
 
04:59:00.310 --> 04:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
funding is available
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
re-side the the ability and we also do
 
04:59:07.128 --> 04:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
need to replace the hanger door which is
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
an old model that doesn't necessarily
 
04:59:10.368 --> 04:59:10.378 align:start position:0%
have all the safety features that modern
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
hanger doors have and those can't be
 
04:59:16.850 --> 04:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
retrofitted into these into these doors
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
so there is there is a lot to the the
 
04:59:21.890 --> 04:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
project it is a full renovation of the
 
04:59:21.900 --> 04:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
project it is a full renovation of the
facility

04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:59:26.448 --> 04:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
it also houses the fixed wing and and it
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
is critical to the New Hampshire State
 
04:59:31.550 --> 04:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
Police I was I was just curious on the
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
size of it yes please follow where is
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
this located
 
04:59:38.690 --> 04:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh this is on uh Airport Road in Concord
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's 91 Airport Road
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent vallone
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I guess I'm asking us
 
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
about the I.T piece and the cyber
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
security that involved because it sounds
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
like those background checks are such
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
critical information and could be
 
05:00:00.050 --> 05:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
subject too again we all know those
 
05:00:02.448 --> 05:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
characters out there who are locking up
 
05:00:05.810 --> 05:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
systems and with ransomware so
 
05:00:07.550 --> 05:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
what's your plan how is it integrate
 
05:00:10.448 --> 05:00:10.458 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the state
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
well well we everything that's on our
 
05:00:17.090 --> 05:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
Network Gets overseen By You know doit
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner doit Dennis Goulet and
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
they work very hard to um to I would say
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
support our Network and we've had some
 
05:00:29.330 --> 05:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
significant Investments recently on
 
05:00:31.368 --> 05:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
cyber security so
 
05:00:31.378 --> 05:00:31.970 align:start position:0%
cyber security so
um

05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
I would just say that that there's a
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
team that focuses on that to ensure that
 
05:00:39.770 --> 05:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
our information is secure thank you
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
05:00:44.400 --> 05:00:45.890 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
representative

05:00:45.890 --> 05:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman if we're done with the
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
discussion of the three items I just I
 
05:00:52.430 --> 05:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
want to ask about another one okay one I
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'll why don't why don't you go ahead
 
05:00:57.110 --> 05:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
mine's a simple question go ahead oh
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and and thanks for taking my
 
05:00:59.400 --> 05:01:01.250 align:start position:0%
thank you and and thanks for taking my
question

05:01:01.250 --> 05:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
on a list that was put in
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
um in the book
 
05:01:09.530 --> 05:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
the uh there was a first item listed was
 
05:01:12.670 --> 05:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
a DMV vision driver licensing system
 
05:01:12.680 --> 05:01:14.410 align:start position:0%
a DMV vision driver licensing system
re-hosting

05:01:14.410 --> 05:01:14.420 align:start position:0%
re-hosting
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
and looking at it it says it's other
 
05:01:17.760 --> 05:01:18.948 align:start position:0%
and looking at it it says it's other
is

05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:01:22.010 --> 05:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
is it somebody far away or someone who
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is because it's other so is
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
is it completely different way of
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
funding it or you just don't want it
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
anymore it's listed number one yep so so
 
05:01:35.208 --> 05:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
05:01:36.890 --> 05:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
those other funds are the cost of
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
collections we spoke about earlier and
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
we are no longer requesting that project
 
05:01:44.930 --> 05:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
the the cost to
 
05:01:47.570 --> 05:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the original concept was to move the
 
05:01:49.490 --> 05:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
vision system to a cloud-based solution
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
to help with long-term I.T costs which
 
05:01:55.610 --> 05:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
escalate if you're hosting locally but
 
05:01:57.288 --> 05:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
in order to do so it was significantly
 
05:02:00.050 --> 05:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
more than our request and more than we
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
were willing to request and so we found
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
an alternative solution to maintain that
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
system over the next biennium so we no
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
I have one more question concerns the
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
helicopter we we own that helicopter we
 
05:02:17.448 --> 05:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
don't lease that what's what's our
 
05:02:20.090 --> 05:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
useful life on that before we need to
 
05:02:21.770 --> 05:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
replace that
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to be looking next
 
05:02:26.090 --> 05:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
year or just wondering what what your
 
05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts are yeah I I you know I'm not
 
05:02:30.890 --> 05:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
comfortable giving you an actual time
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
frame but I can let you know that with
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
the helicopter with our aircraft we
 
05:02:37.128 --> 05:02:37.138 align:start position:0%
regularly go through preventative
 
05:02:40.448 --> 05:02:40.458 align:start position:0%
maintenance there's scheduled engine
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
rebuilds that occur so you can really
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
extend the life of any aircraft if
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're maintaining it properly I
 
05:02:49.550 --> 05:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be comfortable giving an actual
 
05:02:52.010 --> 05:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
Financial time if you could I fully
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
understand and it needs to keep whether
 
05:02:57.050 --> 05:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's a plane or a helicopter in the air
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
is it is it something we expect 20 years
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
out of from the time we bought it
 
05:03:03.770 --> 05:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
I will say
 
05:03:05.570 --> 05:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a stab at that because
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
I asked um I asked Jim Siemens who's um
 
05:03:12.650 --> 05:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
recently been hired and is overseeing
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
some of the equipment and projects that
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
the state police he was a helicopter
 
05:03:18.650 --> 05:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
pilot himself in the Coast Guard and I
 
05:03:20.150 --> 05:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
said how many years can we get out of
 
05:03:20.160 --> 05:03:21.230 align:start position:0%
said how many years can we get out of
this

05:03:21.230 --> 05:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's they they look
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
at the engine hours you know like Steve
 
05:03:27.770 --> 05:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
says they build in the main I think
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're good for I don't think we'll be
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
coming back in the next two years but I
 
05:03:31.920 --> 05:03:32.930 align:start position:0%
coming back in the next two years but I
can't

05:03:32.930 --> 05:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
can't
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
even two to five but I couldn't speak to
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
20. Okay but I think but but a lot of
 
05:03:39.170 --> 05:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's an estimate but they pay very
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
close attention to the engine and the
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
hours and the the infrastructure of it
 
05:03:45.890 --> 05:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
but I think we're good for the next few
 
05:03:49.010 --> 05:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
years all right excellent any uh further
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
questions at this time is there anything
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.690 --> 05:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
no I would just like to thank you for
 
05:03:58.850 --> 05:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
your time we thank you for being here in
 
05:04:03.948 --> 05:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
so we are we are at the um end of our
 
05:04:09.958 --> 05:04:12.050 align:start position:0%
so we are we are at the um end of our
presentations

05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
05:04:12.060 --> 05:04:17.948 align:start position:0%
presentations
the

05:04:17.948 --> 05:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh heading that subcommittee on Monday
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we have a pretty full agenda
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
we also are going to try and exec out
 
05:04:31.250 --> 05:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
the remainder of our bills yes please
 
05:04:31.260 --> 05:04:32.510 align:start position:0%
the remainder of our bills yes please
and

05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
um Mr Shea has some documents here to
 
05:04:36.550 --> 05:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
give you
 
05:04:39.288 --> 05:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
it's going to be important if someone
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
can't be here on the 20th that we find
 
05:04:44.110 --> 05:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
out ahead of time
 
05:04:48.288 --> 05:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
with any luck we are going to call for a
 
05:04:49.610 --> 05:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
05:04:52.368 --> 05:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
on our bill at that time
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes just to clarify so next Wednesday no
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
there's no exec on anything
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday there is okay but it's
 
05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's exacting on the remaining four
 
05:05:09.610 --> 05:05:09.620 align:start position:0%
bills that we have okay in public works
 
05:05:12.128 --> 05:05:12.138 align:start position:0%
exactly executing for
 
05:05:15.770 --> 05:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
hb25 is the is that 20. oh in this one
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thanks thanks for that
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
I believe it is it's
 
05:05:27.890 --> 05:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think in the calendar it's
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
9 A.M for Wednesday to exec for the
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
executive session on our four remaining
 
05:05:35.930 --> 05:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
bills and the the only thing is I mean I
 
05:05:37.850 --> 05:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
guess we've got to take some action on
 
05:05:40.490 --> 05:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
those bills whether it's passing them
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
item or retaining them by the 16th the
 
05:05:46.930 --> 05:05:46.940 align:start position:0%
clerk at one of our meetings was very
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
insistent that he wants any committee
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
reports in his office by noon on
 
05:05:53.448 --> 05:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
Thursday because we're being in session
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
but that's what he told us the other day
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just stressing so I think we've got
 
05:05:59.570 --> 05:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
to take do some action on that executive
 
05:06:02.208 --> 05:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
session either between nine and ten or I
 
05:06:04.010 --> 05:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
think you have a we have the public
 
05:06:05.930 --> 05:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
hearing or sometime by the end of the
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
day on Wednesday right representative
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
Jack yeah the normal deadline for
 
05:06:12.170 --> 05:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
committee reports being to the committee
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
assistant is noon on Wednesday the
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
calendar deadline Thursday gives them
 
05:06:20.090 --> 05:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
time to process it through the clerk's
 
05:06:20.100 --> 05:06:20.810 align:start position:0%
time to process it through the clerk's
office

05:06:20.810 --> 05:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
office
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
so you really have to have it in by noon
 
05:06:24.288 --> 05:06:24.298 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday if you want it to be in
 
05:06:25.788 --> 05:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
Thursday's calendar
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
and and we are going to strive to do
 
05:06:31.128 --> 05:06:31.138 align:start position:0%
that this coming week one of one of our
 
05:06:32.270 --> 05:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
bills which should be pretty
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward is a naming bill and we
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
were waiting for information I'm not
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
going to say anything more than that it
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
looks like the information has come
 
05:06:40.980 --> 05:06:42.050 align:start position:0%
looks like the information has come
forward

05:06:42.050 --> 05:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:06:42.060 --> 05:06:43.730 align:start position:0%
forward
yeah

05:06:43.730 --> 05:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:06:46.730 --> 05:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
so essentially we have three bills
 
05:06:46.740 --> 05:06:48.170 align:start position:0%
so essentially we have three bills
okay

05:06:48.170 --> 05:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:06:50.810 --> 05:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newman yes
 
05:06:53.690 --> 05:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so the
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
Lynch and representative Jack he's
 
05:06:57.530 --> 05:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's Monday
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
Wednesday here for us 10 o'clock are we
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
doing anything on this I think nine
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
o'clock nine o'clock anything on the
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
17th for some reason I have the 17th in
 
05:07:09.890 --> 05:07:09.900 align:start position:0%

05:07:12.250 --> 05:07:12.260 align:start position:0%

that's Monday
 
05:07:37.128 --> 05:07:37.138 align:start position:0%

05:08:20.570 --> 05:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:20.580 --> 05:08:32.208 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:08:32.208 --> 05:08:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.218 --> 05:08:38.990 align:start position:0%
 
work

05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
to be 25.
 
05:08:42.660 --> 05:08:45.310 align:start position:0%
to be 25.
00

05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.730 --> 05:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:51.410 --> 05:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
and you're pulling those notifications
 
05:08:59.628 --> 05:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay we'll we'll check on that right now
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
because if it's not noticed we've got to
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
scramble little yes
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
the cat the calendar came out today I
 
05:09:11.448 --> 05:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
mean I've got a card I'm trying to find
 
05:09:13.610 --> 05:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
it now to see if it's indicate
 
05:09:15.530 --> 05:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
while while we're looking for that
 
05:09:18.288 --> 05:09:18.298 align:start position:0%
represent Mills gone for that uh Mr
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
shade you have some information to share
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
with us with what you just passed out I
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
I do I just wanted particularly for the
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
new members so they understand what I
 
05:09:28.128 --> 05:09:28.138 align:start position:0%
just handed to them what you have is
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
what we talk about is the comparison
 
05:09:32.510 --> 05:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
sheet so as you start to make decisions
 
05:09:35.208 --> 05:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
I'll start I'll start excuse me I will
 
05:09:38.330 --> 05:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
start to populate column D so if you
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
agree for instance on line three that
 
05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
the courthouse generator should be
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
funded at 1.156 I would put that number
 
05:09:47.690 --> 05:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
there and you would see a difference of
 
05:09:50.448 --> 05:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
zero so this is just this is everything
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's contained in the capital budget
 
05:09:55.010 --> 05:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
as it was introduced this isn't the new
 
05:09:56.570 --> 05:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
request that the agencies have brought
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:09:59.930 --> 05:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
I will try to compile some of that
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
information to make it a little bit
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
easier for members but I always
 
05:10:05.208 --> 05:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
encourage you to also look for
 
05:10:07.850 --> 05:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
yourselves in case I miss something
 
05:10:10.128 --> 05:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
secondly representative jacket mentioned
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
that there's the subcommittee on the
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions and we'll gather
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
information the results of that
 
05:10:16.610 --> 05:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be shared with the
 
05:10:17.868 --> 05:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
entire committee
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
so that you will all get to see what we
 
05:10:22.970 --> 05:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
conclude from that day of uh meeting
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
with the agencies and looking at their
 
05:10:24.360 --> 05:10:26.150 align:start position:0%
with the agencies and looking at their
information

05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the third point was and earlier today
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
Russell McConkey had said that on
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we're meeting to start doing
 
05:10:35.448 --> 05:10:35.458 align:start position:0%
some work on House Bill 25 and if
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's any agencies that people feel
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
need to come back to address any
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions I would ask that you go
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
through represent McConkey and that he
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
contact me so I can contact the agencies
 
05:10:47.810 --> 05:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I would assume if I hear nothing that
 
05:10:49.788 --> 05:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
nobody needs to come back and that's all
 
05:10:51.410 --> 05:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
I had unless people had questions for me
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you any questions
 
05:10:58.368 --> 05:10:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:01.730 --> 05:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
I I think we're done thank you
 
05:11:03.530 --> 05:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
