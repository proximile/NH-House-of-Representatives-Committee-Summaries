Strait
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's just no talking about Phil
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
without also mentioning Tony
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
the two went together like the two old
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
men in the balcony on The Muppet Show
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's always what I thought of when I
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
rode with them to Concord
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
Phil lived about a mile south of my
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
house while Tony lived a mile North
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
we tried rotating drivers for a while
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
but it made the most sense to just have
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
fill Drive
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
I sat in the back seat and my view was
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
the back of the heads of Statler and
 
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.310 align:start position:0%
the back of the heads of Statler and
Waldorf

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
Waldorf
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
sometimes our late speaker dick hinch
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
would ride up with us it was comedy the
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
whole ride up
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's just something about the way men
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
talk to each other that I find amusing
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
Phil straight served two terms he was
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
the vice chair of Veterans Affairs
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
for the town he served on many levels
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
including the Watson Park gazebo
 
00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:54.169 align:start position:0%
including the Watson Park gazebo
subcommittee

00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
he had a degree in agriculture
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
I saw him in the park one day with a
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
book four inches thick on the subject
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
just some light reading while he waited
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
for the rest of us to to meet him there
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
to campaign
 
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.140 align:start position:0%
we took out our ads together
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
Waldorf Statler and I
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
selfies were a new thing at the time and
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
we still had an actual Town paper
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
that's where I sent our re-elect selfie
 
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.529 align:start position:0%
that's where I sent our re-elect selfie
picks

00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
picks
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
Phil spoke with an accent that I thought
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
was Southern but was in reality
 
00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:28.070 align:start position:0%
was Southern but was in reality
Midwestern

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
Midwestern
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
every time he said hinch I would laugh
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
speaker hinch didn't understand why it
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
was funny it just was
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
now Phil wasn't without opinions
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
we probably all have a constituent or
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
two that we could swear have no life at
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
all outside their keyboard and social
 
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.230 align:start position:0%
all outside their keyboard and social
media

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
media
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
non-stop lecturing rants
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
needless to say we'd have differing
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
opinions on just about everything with
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
such a constituent
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
Phil Phil summed one of them up one time
 
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.649 align:start position:0%
Phil Phil summed one of them up one time
said

00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
she's like a rabid animal that sinks her
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
teeth in doesn't let go
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
even so he would show nothing but
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
kindness to individuals like that which
 
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
always impressed me
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
he was a good guy
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
I think one of my favorite things about
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
Bill was that he was a huge fan of
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
Ronald Reagan
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
my youngest son used to host a birthday
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
party every year on February 6th
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
our friend representative Mooney was in
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
attendance every time
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
she can attest that it was a big deal
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
cake jelly beans stand up Reagan DVD
 
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
playing in the background and Reagan
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
gifts that varied year to year
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
Phil contributed to the memorial display
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
with Reagan items from his private
 
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.830 align:start position:0%
with Reagan items from his private
collection

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
collection
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes I would find Reagan items on
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
our front doorstep
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
like Santa Claus he would arrive while
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
we were sleeping and leave gifts for my
 
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.590 align:start position:0%
we were sleeping and leave gifts for my
son

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
son
 
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
he was so generous
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
I wish you all could have known him
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
his first term was my second term
 
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
my state house bestie at the time was
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
the former representative Lynette
 
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
the former representative Lynette
Peterson

00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
Peterson
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
I love her to death but if you knew her
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
you would understand this next line
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
poor Phil had to sit next to her
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
his first term up there towards the back
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
of section two
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
from section four I could see him trying
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
to conceal a belly laugh
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
Lynette has that effect on some people
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
for others not so much
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
we affectionately called representative
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
straight Uncle Phil
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
when Lynette and I checked our mail in
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
the ante room Lynette thought it would
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
be funny to stuff all our unwanted mail
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
in Phil's nail slot
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
she would wave me over and say come on
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
Janine let's go see if Uncle Phil got
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
any mail
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
it never stopped being funny
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
and we're not supposed to do that by the
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
when Phil passed away this fall I met
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
his daughter at the services
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
I told Brenda that her dad talked about
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
her all the time
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
she knew who I was too and it was like

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
he wanted a reaction out of you and I
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have a whole lot of interactions
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
with Henry but what I did have was
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
rememberable and I'm just going to share

to say our school deliberative was going
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
off the rails would be an understatement
 
00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099 align:start position:0%
being very discouraged with the chaos my
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker we know that on future
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
session days there will be members of
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
our body who will not be in attendance
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
due to hospitalization or medical
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
condition or because they will test
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
positive for covid-19 or the flu
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
or because they need to care for a
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
family member who might be ill
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
with such a closely divided chamber we
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
all know that attendance will matter
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
more than ever this term
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
just as important as our votes
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
is our ability to keep one another
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
healthy and safe as citizen legislators
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
as volunteers and as Granite Staters
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
this rule Amendment simply allows for a
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
member who is unable to attend session
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
due to medical condition illness or
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
illness in the family to notify the
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
clerk and designate another member as
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
their proxy before close a business
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
before session
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
since we know that every vote matters
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
including votes on floor amendments and
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
procedural votes
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
that proxy would be empowered to cast a
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
vote on every Division and roll call
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
vote following the vote the clerk would
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
call on the member carrying the absent
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
member's proxy for them to publicly and
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
audibly cast their vote in front of the
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
entire chamber
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
no member attending session shall hold
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
more than one proxy for an absent member
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
and a physical Quorum must be present in
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
the house chamber for the proceedings to
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
remain valid
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
now those who oppose proxy voting May
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
cast out on the Integrity of this
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
process suggesting that members May
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
appoint a proxy and proceed to go on a
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
tropical vacation
 
00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:26.339 align:start position:0%
in response I want to remind members
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
that they as well as members of the
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
public have the right to file an Ethics
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
complaint over such Behavior which would
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate place to refer such
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
an incident
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
those who oppose proxy voting may also
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
suggest that this proposal goes too far
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
by allowing members to vote on
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
procedural votes and floor amendments
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
in response I want to again remind the
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
body that in such a closely divided
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
chamber every vote counts including on
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
floor amendments and procedural votes
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
which may be unknown prior to session
 
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.010 align:start position:0%
which may be unknown prior to session
day

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
given the full power and authority a
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
proxy has to represent the absent member
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
this does require a great deal of trust
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
and should that trust be broken an
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
x-complaint could be filed and or a new
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
proxy vote could be declared a new proxy
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
could be declared heading into the next
 
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.089 align:start position:0%
could be declared heading into the next
session

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
should there be a long-term illness or
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
medical condition that keeps a member
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
away from Representatives Hall long term

keeping our loved ones healthy and safe
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
is very important work
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
as we begin our work together in this
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
new biennium there is the additional
 
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.130 align:start position:0%
new biennium there is the additional
consequence

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
should any of us get sick or our family
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
members get sick or absent from a close
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
vote at a house session
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's an added blow even though it
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be that way
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
colleagues please join me in looking out
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%

as we embark on this new session
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
together let's look out for our
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
constituents and ensure that every
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%

00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
even when one of us is unable to attend
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
in person due to medical condition
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
having a contingency plan to see through
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
the commitments we've made to our

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
by voting to pass this floor amendment
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
to house rule 22 the New Hampshire house
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
will Empower itself
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
to follow this example of other
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
legislative Chambers across the country
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
and even the United States Congress
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
each utilizing proxy voting in their own
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
way to help fulfill their duties I
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge my colleagues to vote
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
Yes on this
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
GI recognizes Representative Steven
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know the the idea of one person one
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
vote that we hold sacred in this country
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
and it's enshrined in federal law
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
should we be any different I mean look
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
around at your colleagues which one of
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
them do you think should have twice the
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
voting power you do because this rule
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that you cast the votes
 
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
in the manner that the member intended
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's actually not even any recourse
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
in here if they don't other than that
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
the aggrieved party there can go
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
shopping for somebody else to cast their
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
votes with no hope or guarantee that
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
they will do the same thing functionally
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
this gives a member of the House two
 
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.970 align:start position:0%
this gives a member of the House two
votes

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
I should be able to just stop talking
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
there and sit down but I know better
 
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.970 align:start position:0%
there and sit down but I know better
today

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's no procedure here either so the
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
they notify the clerk that this person
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be my proxy let me tell you
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
about my morning
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
so I have a bad knee I gotta have it
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
replaced having that time or money to do
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
it yet that's a medical problem and this
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
morning I have branches in my remote
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
road that I have to get here I'm trying
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
to clear them I twist it up pretty bad
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
super intense pain can't take
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
painkillers because I got an almost two
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
hour drive it would have been very easy
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
for me to say you know what
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
my friend from Auburn he's just going to
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
cast votes for me from now on any time
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
there's bad weather because of the risk
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
of damaging my leg further
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
that's not what I signed up to do
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
I ran for office so that I could come
 
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:29.579 align:start position:0%
here and be the physical representation
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
of my district as the very least I owe
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
them and yeah it doesn't happen all the
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
time challenges happen
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
children get sick you hurt yourself you
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
get sick but you do the best you can
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's the very least that we owe them to
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
come here and not give our vote away to
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
someone else thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
and also be in order
 
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.089 align:start position:0%
and also be in order

[Music]
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
roll call has been called for is that
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded it is sufficiently
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a roll call vote
 
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:14.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:49.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
members will be in your seats
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm for a
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that other State's
 
00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.099 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies and even the U.S
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
Congress have recently authorized proxy
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
voting as a way to protect the health
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
and safety of their members while
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
ensuring duly elected representatives
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
are provided the opportunity to vote
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
and if I know that On Any Given session
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
day there will be members of both
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
parties on both sides of the aisle who
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
may be home or hospitalized due to
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
medical condition illness or illness in
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
the family and others who will feel
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
significant pressure to show up in
 
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
Concord to cast a key vote despite
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
putting their own health and or the
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
health of their colleagues at risk and
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that as the
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
minority leader of the sustained body
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
the caucus I lead statistically speaking
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
has less to gain by allowing for proxy
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
voting but that it's still worth doing
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it's the right thing to do and
 
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
would I now push the green button to
 
00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
enfranchise every Granite stator with
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
full representation in this closely
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
divided chamber where every vote on
 
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
every bill will surely count this
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
I recognize the Representative Steven
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that a
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
little less than two years ago when we
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out how to meet
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
safely I proposed having people in
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
different rooms and have room captains
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
bring their votes chamber and if I
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
remember that that was that received
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
bipartisan condemnation as being akin to
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
proxy voting a precedent we should never
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
set here
 
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
if I know that no other state right now
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
is using proxy voting and that the
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
United States Congress is getting rid of
 
00:53:59.280 --> 00:53:59.990 align:start position:0%
United States Congress is getting rid of
it

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if those members
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
from the other party who told me I was
 
00:54:04.859 --> 00:54:05.870 align:start position:0%
from the other party who told me I was
wrong

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
a little less than two years ago were
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
right then
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that they'll be right today when
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
they vote no would I press the red
 
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
they vote no would I press the red
button

00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
button
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm's amendment to
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
rule 22c
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote if you're in

speaker and happy New Year colleagues
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
long ago and far away before the
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic the vast majority of us had no
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
idea what Zoom was or Microsoft teams
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
many hadn't even attended a meeting
 
00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.530 align:start position:0%
many hadn't even attended a meeting
online

00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
in March 2020 we sat here overnight
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
plowing through bills at what would be
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
the last house session in this chamber
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
for a really long time
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a journey and how things
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
have changed
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
at the speaker's discretion this
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to house rule 31
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
would permit our house committees and
 
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to remit to meet remotely
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
or in hybrid in addition to meeting in
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
person as they do now
 
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
a quorum may be determined based on
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
Virtual attendance which was deemed
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
permissible by our state supreme court
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
this rule is required by Mason's rules
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
to permit us to go remote in our
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
committees you can ask the clerk
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
this simple Common Sense proposal
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
enables the speaker to take whatever
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
actions he feels appropriate with
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
respect to remote attendance for members
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
as we learned two years ago one never
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
knows what the next day will bring this
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
body should be prepared to respond by
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
passing this rule change today why wait
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's a great rule to have in our rule
 
00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:19.670 align:start position:0%
it's a great rule to have in our rule
box

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
box
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
when the governor declared the state of
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
emergency for our state
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
speaker shirtleff and his team including
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
me had to act quickly to continue the
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
much needed legislative work we had to
 
00:58:32.099 --> 00:58:33.049 align:start position:0%
much needed legislative work we had to
do

00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
long hours were spent with staff members
 
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
understanding various meeting programs
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
like learning what Zoom was developing
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
new protocols for the meeting setting up
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
member trainings learning how to mute
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
and unmute raise those darn little
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
yellow hands and get our videos on
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
providing for Testimony to be taken
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
getting the technology to live stream
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
our meetings and figuring out how to
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
Archive them
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard continued this work by
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
arranging for hybrid meetings with some
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee members in committee rooms and
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
others online
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
this was to keep us healthy but as we
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
have learned all this work had other
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
benefits for us as members and for the
 
00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.990 align:start position:0%
benefits for us as members and for the
public

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
today we have the technology for remote
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
participation the necessary media staff
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
and committee rooms wired for live
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
streaming we've successfully held
 
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
hundreds of remote and hybrid committee
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
meetings so now here we are in 2023 with
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
that experience and understanding we
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
should act accordingly
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
while not always ideal we learned that
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
providing the remote option for our
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
members makes our meetings more
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
inclusive it facilitates attendance for
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
those with health child care or family
 
01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:01.730 align:start position:0%
those with health child care or family
challenges

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
having the remote option can help us
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
represent our constituents better
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
parents with sick children can still do
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
their jobs as legislators
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
substitute committee members are
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
terrific but they do not have the
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge base regular committee members
 
01:00:19.319 --> 01:00:20.569 align:start position:0%
knowledge base regular committee members
do

01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
as we try to make the legislature more
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
inclusive particularly for those who are
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
younger have children or have to work it
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
behooves us to permit remote attendance
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear if this rule is adopted the
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
speaker need not re permit remote
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
testimony that is the speaker's decision
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
we now have the know-how and the support
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
system to permit remote participation
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
we should make our committee meetings
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
more open and facilitate remote
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
attendance we should pass this Common
 
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
Sense enabling amendment to house rule
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
31 permitting the speaker to act on
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
remote participation whether it be for
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
emergencies or day-to-day business
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
we do know how to do this and we should
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
press the green button to pass this
 
01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:18.230 align:start position:0%
press the green button to pass this
amendment

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I'll take no
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions and Mr Speaker I request a
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
division vote thank you
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
I recognize that Representative Steven
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
Smith speak again the motion to speak
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
well I have a little egg on my face
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
because I had the honor of working on
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
new legislative orientation and I just
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
got done telling them
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
that the very least that we can do for
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
the public and our constituents and one
 
01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
of the most important things we do is to
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
come here and sit before them and hear
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
their problems
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
this could eliminate that
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
there is no worse look for the
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
legislatures yes this is very good for
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislators you don't have to come I
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
don't come here to do things that are
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
good for me I come here to do things
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
that are good for the public and
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's hard inconvenience
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
but I volunteered just like the rest of
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
you and I knew what I was signing up for
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
going in
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic I when we were
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
having virtual committee meetings I had
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
to introduce one of my bills I was here
 
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
working on other things anyway so I went
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
to the committee room
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
I was the only human being in the room
 
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
so like picture that there I am sitting
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
in a chair in the middle of the
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee room alone
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
and there are people on streams it was
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
like something out of a bad science
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
fiction movie
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
it gets worse then they start talking
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
about well where's representative Smith
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
he's supposed to be introducing his bill
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
I don't see him logged in and I'm
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
thinking really
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
like look at the darn camera I actually
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
had to start waving my arms
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
and then they noticed me and laughed
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
because they thought it was funny
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
what if there were members of the public
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
there to see that what if they were
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
watching to see that sort of circus
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
debacle it's embarrassing
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
we dress professionally when we come
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
here because we're showing the public
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
respect and committee hearings we sit
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
politely dressed well silently without
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
our Electronics open listening to the
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
public testify this is a duty that we
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
owe them
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
if you agree with me please vote against
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
well remember yield to a question
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
is there a hole has requested a roll
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the four
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to rule 31.
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative evil
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
if I know that passing this amendment
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
authorizes the speaker to permit remote
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
or hybrid attendance for house
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
committees and subcommittees as he sees
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
fit but does not require him to do so
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
if I know that allowing remote
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
attendance for members would enable
 
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
those with health child care or family
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
challenges to better fulfill their
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to their constituents
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
if I know we have the experience
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
knowledge and ability to operate house
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
committees remotely are in hybrid and we
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
know well how to do it
 
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we never know what
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
the next day will bring so we really
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
should be prepared would I now press the
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a1 section 3B which only permits

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
that is a proper motion so the motion
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
before us is the table and I would
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
request a division vote
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%

the question before us is the tabling

01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
to household 46
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote the
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Weber
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the current
 
01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:53.209 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the current
practice

01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
when a committee has a divided vote
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
is to offer the ought to pass motion
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.669 align:start position:0%
is to offer the ought to pass motion
first

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this rule is fair
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
because it is completely content neutral
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know that permitting the chair
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
or ranking the chair or the vice chair
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
of the committee to pick which motion
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
comes first
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
maybe quicker but it certainly negates
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
the work of the other 19 members of the
 
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.830 align:start position:0%
the work of the other 19 members of the
committee

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
and if I've heard here already that we
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
are here to do the people's work and not
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
to do it for our own convenience
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
would I now vote Yes on the tabling
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%

for our own convenience and if I further
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
know that we should debate the house
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
rules by doing the people's work and
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
that this rule deserves to be debated
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
among this body and not simply put away
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%

everybody in this room can recognize
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
that we are going to have a large number
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
of bills coming committee split 10 to
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
10. regardless of the content of the
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
bills regardless of what is going on who
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
is there on the day of committee these
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
votes are go and these motions that are
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
be made out of committee without
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
recommendation will be more frequent
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
this term than they ever have been
 
01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
this term than they ever have been
before

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
every time that we have to make a most
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
have a vote on emotion that is ought to
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
pass automatically out of the committee
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we might not have the votes for and
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
then we have to flip to take the time to
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
then make it to an itl is going to take
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
time out of our time here to do the
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
people's work
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
we got to remember the people that we
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
are fighting for when we're in this
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
house it's it's not all about the
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and the process and making
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
sure that we keep things the same way
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
and frankly we've seen a number of
 
01:14:48.169 --> 01:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
offers of amendments today that would
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
change the way we we've done things I
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with them but this is a
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
modest change for the future of the
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
house so that we can navigate these next
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
two years fighting for the mother who
 
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
can't heat her house fighting for the
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
father struggling to pay grocery bills
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to fight for the people and
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
that's what this amendment does we're
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to empower the chairs or the vice
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairs of the Committees the people that
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
know what the legislation is going
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
through from their committees adhering
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
and and giving them the floor to make
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
the first motion on the bill it does not
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
mean necessarily that what the chair
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
makes a motion on is what's the house is
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to pass it just allows a little
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
bit more of a process to move forward
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
without an automatic ought to pass
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
motion on any bill that comes out of the
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee without recommendation and for
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
that I would implore you to vote yes
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
as a member yield to questions
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
remember does not yield
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.970 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
is going to keep the members of this
 
01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.970 align:start position:0%
is going to keep the members of this
house

01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
from passionately representing their
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
constituents nothing so no rule change
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
is going to change that
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
so that's the emotional bit right there
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
but we are in an unprecedented times
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
we are completely
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
we are we are virtually equally divided
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and our committees are equally divided
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
and there was a great amount of
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
discussion and cooperation at the
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the session
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:39.620 align:start position:0%
but this rule completely turns that
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement on its head
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
because it gives all the power
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
to determine how a bill will proceed
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
not to the committee as a whole
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
but to one person on the committee
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
and the other 19 people's work
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
the point of having the ought to pass go
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
first is that it is completely content
 
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.910 align:start position:0%
first is that it is completely content
neutral

01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
and remember
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
some of the bills will come out ought to
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
pass some of them will come out you know
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
some some would prefer to have the main
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
but if we follow our traditions
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
we make sure that we are preserving the
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
honor of the work of every single member
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
of a committee and not giving one member
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the say that each member's vote is
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
so it may take us a little longer we
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
my suggestion has always been let's give
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
it a try for a couple of days
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
if it's too slow we can go on talking
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
about how to deal with this and if
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
there's a good bipartisan solution and I
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
think there is very good will on both
 
01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:13.100 align:start position:0%
sides to keep talking about it
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
then we can always amend these votes by
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
a super majority these rules by a super
 
01:18:18.659 --> 01:18:19.850 align:start position:0%
a super majority these rules by a super
majority

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
so I would urge you to preserve the
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the committee process
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
let us not put our convenience over the
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
fairness that we have all pledged in
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
these unprecedented times and please
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
Xena Poole has requests that are all
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.060 align:start position:0%

01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%

reconsideration and ask the members to

01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
rule 64. the chair recognizes
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order the member
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment before us today would
 
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
restore a house rule that until 2011 had
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
stood for 40 years
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
if we approve it carrying or possessing
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons in this chamber the
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
gallery and anti-rooms would once again
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
be prohibited
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
for the last few sessions changes in the
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
party controlling the majority have
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
controlled the fate of deadly weapons in
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
this chamber
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
under the current rule which this
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
amendment would change deadly weapons
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
can be brought into this chamber but
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
they must be concealed because
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
displaying them is prohibited
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
those who favor the current rule argue
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
that legislators and visitors deserve
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
the right to defend themselves
 
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
they claim that changing the rule to ban
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
guns from the chamber would make us soft
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
targets for terrorists and mass shooters
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
to that I would respectfully say welcome
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
to the club
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
this is a risk that school children in
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and across the country
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
live with every day
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
not to mention people who walk into
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
grocery stores Hospital workers and
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
every person who Ventures outside their
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
home into a public place
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
with gun ownership now at a record high
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
and more firearms in circulation than
 
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
ever before it's become sadly apparent
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
that more guns in more places isn't part
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the solution
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's part of the problem
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
in this particular chamber the firing of
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
a weapon either intentionally in
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
self-defense or accidentally comes with
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
tremendous risks
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
take a look around this room and take a
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
look at your colleagues
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
look at a legislator who might be
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
sitting a few sections over from you and
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
draw a mental line between yourself and
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
that person
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
depending on where you sit and who
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that mental line you
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
just drew could intersect or come within
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
a few inches of a dozen or more of your
 
01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.850 align:start position:0%
a few inches of a dozen or more of your
colleagues

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
now imagine that we're not talking about
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
a mental line
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
imagine that we're talking about a
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
bullet from a dropped firearm
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
inadvertently discharging something
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's already happened multiple times
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
or imagine that it's a bullet
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
intentionally discharged by a person uh
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
in a in a situation where uh adrenaline
 
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
is Flowing uh and where nobody really
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
quite understands what's going on in
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
response to a perceived threat
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
either way the risks are obvious in a
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
crowded chamber where legislators are
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
packed into seats like sardines and
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
where the gallery is quite often
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the years that deadly weapons have
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
been allowed in this chamber there have
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
been several incidents where Firearms
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
have been accidentally dropped
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a crowded room with cramped seating
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
that often forces many of us to Vault
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
over each other simply to do what I'm
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
doing now to speak at the well or just
 
01:28:59.810 --> 01:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
to use the restroom the risk of
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
accidents and accidental discharges is
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
very real
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
but beyond concerns for Public Safety as
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
well as our own safety and our own
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
individual rights
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
this issue raises a key question
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
is this chamber an appropriate or a
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
necessary place for people to bring guns
 
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
or other weapons or should it be a place
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
reserved for Goodwill
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
healthy debates and our best ideas for
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
moving this state forward so all of our
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
constituents can lead Better Lives
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
we don't allow deadly weapons to be
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
carried into our courtrooms we don't
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
allow them to be carried into prisons
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
and whether openly displayed or
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
concealed we shouldn't allow them to be
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
carried into the people's house by
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
anyone other than Troopers and Security
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%

01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:10.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues we were
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
just asked to do a lot of imagining
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
imagine this you live in a country where
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to give a reason it's
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
your right the Constitution says it's
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
your right state law house rules do not
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
Trump the Constitution we've already
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
found that that last term when someone
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
tried to stop a member from carrying and
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
it went all the way to the Supreme Court
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that side argued that house rules
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
reign supreme the Supreme Court of the
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
state said no they do not the
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution Reigns Supreme so we don't
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
have to give a reason we don't have to
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
imagine it's our right to defend
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves and as I heard earlier no
 
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
house rule is going to stop the members
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
from defending themselves please vote
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that firearms and

representatives Hall did not used to be
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
a partisan issue and that for decades
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
there was bipartisan agreement that this
 
01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
chamber was not an appropriate place for
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons

and having pulled a number of bills off
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
of consent in the eight years I was here
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
I can testify to the fact that I
 
01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of reasons to pull a
 
01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.390 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of reasons to pull a
bill

01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
but out of all the bills I pulled off
 
01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:25.139 align:start position:0%
consent I was successful in flipping it
 
01:36:25.139 --> 01:36:26.629 align:start position:0%
consent I was successful in flipping it
once

01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%

01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
House Bill 668 in 2016 it was a 19-0
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
vote out of committee after about a
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
month we got the bill flipped from an
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
itl to an auto pass
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
the success rate on Flipping bills on
 
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
the floor is very very low when it's
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
pulled off of consent
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
the reason I introduce this amendment is
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
if there's any desire to actually have a
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
discussion finding 10 other people to
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
agree with you is not a difficult task
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to voice your opposition to
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk on a bill you can submit a
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
little slip of paper saying I didn't
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
like house bill whatever and it can be
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
noted in the permanent Journal
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
six minutes in this chamber equates to
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
one man week worth of time we should be
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
very careful about how we use the house
 
01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.189 align:start position:0%
very careful about how we use the house

time
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see someone take and
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
pull a bunch of bills off consent and
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
force everyone to sit in their seats
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
for several hours just to delay the
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
proceedings I would ask for your support
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%

Hampshire House of Representatives and
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm honored to be here as you all
 
01:37:53.050 --> 01:37:53.060 align:start position:0%
are we are often cautioned against
 
01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
looking for solutions to problems that
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't exist so do bills get pulled off
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
of consent yes they do
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
sorry to hear about the representatives
 
01:38:08.209 --> 01:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
you know inability to get those
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
committee recommendations flipped when
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
he pulled them off consent but in three
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
terms three full terms I've never seen
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
abuse of pulling bills off of consent I
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
pulled one off last session I I knew
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
that bill was going nowhere but I owed
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
it to my constituents to fight the good
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
fight and those those debates are
 
01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
usually very limited in in time and so
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's only one story I've ever heard
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
of of a representative from from
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
Manchester who may or may not have
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
pulled every bill off consent and then
 
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
promptly went home
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
but that's kind of elegant too right I
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
mean that's you got to tip your hat to
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
that this is this is a solution chasing
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist and for
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
that reason I would encourage you to
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
vote uh against this rule Amendment
 
01:38:57.169 --> 01:38:57.179 align:start position:0%

practice of praying to God capital G
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
as the word prayer speaks more to
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
religion invocation has a broader
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
meaning which can be spiritual in nature
 
01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily religious an
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
invocation can be a prayer but it does
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
not need to be a prayer
 
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
although many in this chamber seek
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
guidance from a higher being others seek

the word invocation allows for the

inclusion of these and similar images in

thank you Mr
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
if I know that the term invocation is
 
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
frequently used to describe the
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
religious or spiritual act at the
 
01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:53.699 align:start position:0%
beginning of an event or a ceremony
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the term invocation
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
takes into account the multiplicity of
 
01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
religious and spiritual practices of

and finally if I know that using the
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
term invocation doesn't inhibit the work
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the chaplain
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if if I
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
know we've heard a lot of reasons why we
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
should honor tradition and not be making
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
changes for the sake of making changes
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Speaker if I also know that it is
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
actually not unheard of to have

technically prayers at the beginning of
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
session and that there is of course no
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
no ban on giving an invocation over
 
01:47:08.570 --> 01:47:08.580 align:start position:0%

but

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:50.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.689 --> 01:49:02.699 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker

Mr Speaker
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
it was about speeches under unanimous
 
01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:10.139 align:start position:0%
consent to the house usually at the end
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
of our day after the third reading
 
01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.770 align:start position:0%
of our day after the third reading
motion

01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
these speeches aren't on the topic of
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
the business aren't on a topic of
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
business before the house they're about
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
anything else a member would like to
 
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
publicly mention
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
Memorial remarks remarks about an
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
important event in history
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
or even one member has used the time to
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
wish his wife a happy anniversary as he
 
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
was stuck in session on that special day
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
the current process is that if unanimous
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
consent is withdrawn it triggers a vote
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
on if the member should be allowed to
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
continue with the consent of the house
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
this currently requires a simple
 
01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
majority of those present
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
this rule change would require a sixty
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
percent majority of those present for
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
the member to continue speaking
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
we have had several instances of issues
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
with this in the past where it came down
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
to a party line vote
 
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
I don't think this serve serves anyone
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
well nor the house as an institution to
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a party line votes on this topic
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
with our razor thin division between the
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
parties this term every vote under the
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
existing rule will be a toss-up
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
especially at the end of the day
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
this is an area where I think it makes
 
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
sense to require a super majority and
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
that off-topic speeches like this should
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
only be made with bipartisan agreement
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
of the members and this rule would
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
Implement that by setting the bar at
 
01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.290 align:start position:0%
Implement that by setting the bar at
three-fifths

01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
three-fifths
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
I ask you to vote Yes to pass this rule
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
floor amendment to house rule 58.
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
those opposed nay
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the motion is
 
01:50:54.600 --> 01:51:09.530 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the motion is
adopted

01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
Zen of Weber
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
has a four amendment to house rule 58
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
I agree entirely with the previous
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
speaker and what we just passed is one
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
half of the amendment that I suggested
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
after discussion with colleagues on both
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.050 --> 01:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has happened once
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
once an objection to consent has
 
01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.530 align:start position:0%
once an objection to consent has
happened

01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
according to Mason's rules it may not be
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
removed renewed so you get to object
 
01:51:51.119 --> 01:51:52.370 align:start position:0%
removed renewed so you get to object
once

01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
at least once in this chamber that has
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
been used by somebody who before a
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
member even began to speak
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
got up and said
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
I have jacked
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
and we all sat here and wondered why
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
they were objecting
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
well we all voted to let the members
 
01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.530 align:start position:0%
well we all voted to let the members
speak

01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
and then the members strayed into some
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
more politically
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
charged Waters
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
and somebody stood up and said I object
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
and the clerk said
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
he can't renew the objection because
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
Masons doesn't allow it and it's not in
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
our house rules
 
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
so the what the second part of my
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment does is it allows the
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
objection to be renewed once we don't
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
want to do this forever nobody wants to
 
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
be here all night
 
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
but the objection can be renewed once if
 
01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
somebody Strays into murky Waters so I
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
urge the adoption of this amendment
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
which incorporates the earlier Amendment
 
01:52:59.930 --> 01:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the division
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment
 
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%

01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:11.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:54:11.050 --> 01:54:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to rule house rule 58.
 
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote chair recognizes
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a parliamentary
 
01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:26.750 align:start position:0%

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if we've already done good
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
work but if there's a little more work
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be done and I want to be able to
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
renew an objection one time
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
to keep us on track
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
would I then press the green button
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
know there have been discussions about
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
this second part that the previous
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned and that we
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
have not yet come to a full agreement on
 
01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
how it should be handled and if I also
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
know that the amendment before us does
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
not mesh well with the previous
 
01:55:08.890 --> 01:55:08.900 align:start position:0%
amendment that we passed and the
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
language and the rules will then get
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
very convoluted as to what parts should
 
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
control if we were to pass both would I
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
now press the red button
 
01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
and not pass this amendment
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to house rule 58. this is a
 
01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
division vote if you're in favor you'll
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
press the green button if you approach
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
you'll press the red button reporting
 
01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:03.890 align:start position:0%

01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
rule change that we just passed by a
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
vote of 200 to 173 be placed into the
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
permanent journal to make it clear that
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
the renewal of an objection is is once
 
01:57:33.649 --> 01:57:33.659 align:start position:0%
and and only once and that it can't be
 
01:57:33.659 --> 01:57:36.830 align:start position:0%
and and only once and that it can't be
recurring

01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
the motion is to print the remarks
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative Reed has a floor
 
01:57:58.609 --> 01:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
amendment to house rule 100.
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the rules change before us
 
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
here would simply say that if a chair
 
01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
and committee institutes a time limit
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
that that time limit be applied equally
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think this is something we all
 
01:58:34.370 --> 01:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
understand to be basic fairness and
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
indeed most good chairs already
 
01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:41.219 align:start position:0%
observe that practice there are
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
certainly some conditions in which a
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
chair might have to change time limit or
 
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:50.540 align:start position:0%
Institute a time limit for example
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
if a hearing is going long in a time
 
01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
limit was not instituted but then has to
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
be instituted or if for example there's
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
an expert that's relaying information
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
that only that expert is privy to that
 
01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:06.500 align:start position:0%
is why in this rule change
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
the statement is included if this
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
process cannot be followed the chairman
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
must submit a statement explaining why
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
this could not be done for the committee
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
file so it's not onerous if there are
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons that the chair cannot
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
follow this all they have to do is
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
submit the statement for the clerk and
 
01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:26.900 align:start position:0%
for the committee file
 
01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
but this would help discover encourage
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
something that has happened in the past
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
which is the abuse of this
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
predominant precedent
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.169 --> 01:59:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Speaker member yields
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative American choir thank you
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
Mr speaker thank you for taking my
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
question I'm just trying to get this
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
straight so if there's a time limit set
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
for the amount of speakers because
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's too many looks like there's
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of speakers then the
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
chair would not have the discretion to
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
say I'll give an example from my
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
committee the Science and Tech that the
 
02:00:08.330 --> 02:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of energy
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
is speaking and he gets to have more
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
time than a private individual from
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who just happens to drive
 
02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
up and want to talk on a subject that
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be allowed that is
 
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
incorrect as I just explained as I just
 
02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
explained the purpose of this rule is to
 
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
prevent the abuse of what has been
 
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:29.060 align:start position:0%
practiced in the past to prevent
 
02:00:32.450 --> 02:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
basically paltry political game playing
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
with time limits and that is why if a
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
chair does choose to change time limit
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
halfway through or allow a particular
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
expert all they have to do is submit a
 
02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:45.659 align:start position:0%
note into the committee file say saying
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
why that they could not or chose not to
 
02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
there's the member yield or further
 
02:00:52.619 --> 02:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
there's the member yield or further
question

02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
oh yes I do so it seems to me as if it
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't really accomplish anything
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
because if the if the Chairman's doing
 
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
this if the chairman is doing this
 
02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.570 align:start position:0%
this if the chairman is doing this
because

02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:04.580 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
this is a question representative he
 
02:01:09.050 --> 02:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
could just justify that by writing down
 
02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
whatever he wanted the point is to
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
discourage what I would just simply
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
bluntly call cheating and so if you have
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
to come up with an actual reason that
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
you cannot allow equal time to everybody
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
but your actual reason was paltry
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
politics then you'd have to come up with
 
02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
something creative if you know that you
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
have to disclose that in advance then
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't do that
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
I request a division
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:48.860 align:start position:0%
occasionally we've all seen a committee
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh someone comes in to testify and they
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
get very emotional they break down into
 
02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:55.189 align:start position:0%
get very emotional they break down into
tears

02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
tears
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
I've seen it I'm sure you've seen it and
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
when that occurs I would like to think
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
that the chair would have the discretion
 
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
to give that individual some extra time
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
without being constrained by this type
 
02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
of limitation could you could you
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
respond to that please absolutely once
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
again that would be a simple note by the
 
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
chair placed into the committee file the
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
person providing testimony was
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
experiencing emotional distress and had
 
02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
to be given extra time to compose
 
02:02:23.219 --> 02:02:27.290 align:start position:0%
to be given extra time to compose
themselves

02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.729 --> 02:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:02:47.089 --> 02:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker as a past chairman for many
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
years there have been situations where
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
you kind of recalibrate what's going on
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
I myself personally would always make
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
any changes in discussing it with the
 
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
minority or the opposite party and I
 
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
don't think that the idea of putting
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
this in rules is really going to make
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
people do things better or do something
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
more on us or do something right writing
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
a note is seems a little extraneous to
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
be sticking in a file and let alone
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
would it would people second guess what
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman was doing
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we got our YouTube
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
everybody can see what happened in the
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
committee and then everyone can be the
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
motion before us is the floor amendment

Cassandra Reed offers a floor amendment
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
to house rule 106. care recognizes
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
how's the house will be in order
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
um house rule 106 simply codifies what
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
is already supposed to be our practice
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
which is to say a member any member can
 
02:06:33.050 --> 02:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
participate in a hearing from either one
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
side or the other of the table either
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
they testify or they question they do
 
02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
not do both and that that rule will
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
apply equally to everybody it is
 
02:06:45.050 --> 02:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
predominantly the practice but has not
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
always been equally applied and I think
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
that the people of this state deserve to
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
have uniformity in how their bills are
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
treated here regardless of the committee
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
chair that happens to be sitting on that
 
02:07:01.970 --> 02:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
committee that day so it's fairly simple
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:11.460 align:start position:0%

okay

02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:32.569 --> 02:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
let's um
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyway that day I was using an old
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
phone with weak battery and
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
um what's weaker than my current phone
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
also there's no Wi-Fi in a lot so I was
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
unable to see the video from Washington
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
DC's but I could see the headlines and
 
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
of course I was busy with I work in the
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
parking lot so I didn't grasp a full
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
magnitude what happened until I got
 
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
panicky phone calls from family members
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
now it's a blessing not seeing that
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
video in real time it spared me
 
02:15:59.810 --> 02:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
personally some of the shock and I'm
 
02:16:01.729 --> 02:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
horrified and still horrified and I
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
don't think it matters whoever will
 
02:16:05.569 --> 02:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
suspend fall for it it was horrifying
 
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend all right thank
 
02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:08.169 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend all right thank
you

02:16:08.169 --> 02:16:08.179 align:start position:0%

parliamentary
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to know what is the specific
 
02:20:00.429 --> 02:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
rule and in which of our
 
02:20:03.889 --> 02:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
documents are we not allowed to say
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
something that would be considered
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
disparaging of a U.S a former U.S
 
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.310 align:start position:0%
disparaging of a U.S a former U.S
president

02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
president
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
disparaging remarks are
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
are about anybody and ever allowed in
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
this chamber that that goes for that's
 
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's been a pretty much a standing
 
02:20:29.450 --> 02:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
I don't think I actually meant
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
disparaging as much as criticism of a
 
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
former uh constructive criticism of a
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
former U.S president well that that's
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's disparaging remarks okay just
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
clarifying they I would like to know
 
02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
what the um specific rule it or part of
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
our documents that we follow that says
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
that just so we can fully understand
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
genuinely just curious nothing nefarious
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
will will it will address that in in our
