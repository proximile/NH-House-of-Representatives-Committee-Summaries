i'm bob heffner i'm from hudson
 
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
we both spent 10 years here in the
 
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislature and on this committee and it
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
tara is a democrat i'm a republican
 
00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
and we used to swap chairs every term
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh because the majority would change and
 
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.949 align:start position:0%
uh because the majority would change and
we'd

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
we'd
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
just swap chairs
 
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 align:start position:0%
uh but we've gotten along great ever
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
since and
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
we now work for the council of state
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
governments as agriculture policy
 
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.790 align:start position:0%
governments as agriculture policy
advisors

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
advisors
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
so we actually share the job um as a job
 
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 align:start position:0%
sharing thing just so that we could
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
continue working together which is nice
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
council of state governments i don't
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
know do all of you know what it is have
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
you heard of council of state
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
governments it's similar to ncsl i don't
 
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
know if you've heard of that too
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's a membership organization
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
all these states in the country
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
pay in the legislatures pay in for the
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
membership dues and that's what supports
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
us in exchange for which you get
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
research services you get socialization
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
with other representatives at
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
conferences and policy summits we do
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
blogs we do research we do
 
00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.429 align:start position:0%
blogs we do research we do
newsletters

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
newsletters
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
but what we do mostly is we bring people
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
together with legislators that are on
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
the same committees in other states so
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
that you can meet them talk to them and
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on come up with
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
ideas about what legislation you may
 
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
propose for the next session
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
find out that there's more to
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislation than just new hampshire
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
there are states all around us that do
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
things differently but they do it for
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
the same goal and it's fascinating it
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
really is so that's what we do
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
um it is an organization that's been
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
around since
 
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.390 align:start position:0%
around since
[Music]

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
1936 or something like that we've been
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
around for a long time
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
and we are in the eastern region of this
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
national organization which means we
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
have 11 northeastern states starting
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
maryland delaware pennsylvania all the
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
way up to all the new england states
 
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
five eastern canadian provinces
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
and two territories puerto rico and the
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
virgin islands so that's who we
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
serve and we have the opportunity to go
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
around and visit the state houses of all
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
of these member states and so that's why
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
we're here this is coming to our
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
favorite state
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
we've

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
been doing 11 state houses a year
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh so we we get to travel until covet
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
hit and then we've done very little in
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
the way of visiting state houses
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
although today we're here
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
thursday we're in vermont
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like we're going to
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts very shortly and in may
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
will be in harrisburg at least so we're
 
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.830 align:start position:0%
will be in harrisburg at least so we're
getting

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about the annual
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
meeting i'll talk about the annual
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
some of the things the policy issues
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we've been dealing with lately
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
the main one that we've been dealing
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
with is the
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
transportation issue with goods because
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
of covid you know the snap the snag of
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
all of the trucks coming through and
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
what is that that is doing to
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
agriculture and how we can in the future
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
respond better to
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
emergencies in the transportation system
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
like this some things that we can do
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
most of which seems to be
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that we in our region
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
have a food supply that we don't need to
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
have things trucked in all the time
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
there is capacity
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so we are working as a region to try
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
to get that up and running a regional
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
food system
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
what other things have we talked about
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
we've been talking
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
about carbon farming
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh what uh
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
rural broadband has been a big topic for
 
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.990 align:start position:0%
rural broadband has been a big topic for
us

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and now we're going to talk about
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
it some more because we've got lots of
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
money coming in from the infrastructure
 
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.629 align:start position:0%
money coming in from the infrastructure
bill

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.870 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
the objective now is
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
how do you get a hold of that money and
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
you and be able to use it
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
because this time for the first time is
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
going to be in the hands of the states
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
and not in the hands of the fcc who are
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to be doling it out
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
strictly to comcast or verizon or
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
whomever and the last mile never gets
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
covered and so hopefully we'll be able
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
to figure this out but we're going to
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that each state has an
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure on how to dole out this
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
money and to whom
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
and it's a smooth process so that's
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
interesting another thing that we do
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
the shortage of meat processing
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
um it's it's getting to the point where
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
you have to wait a year and a half just
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
to get your animals scheduled for
 
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.790 align:start position:0%
to get your animals scheduled for
slaughter

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
slaughter
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
that does not help
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
local food production
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
and so until we get either a
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of kill bays in
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
the area
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
what was it
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes 30. it's been estimated that we
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
didn't need another 30 kill base just to
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
handle the demand
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
in new england right and right now
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
no one is proposing new um
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
slaughterhouses because they're so
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to get up and running anyway
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
enough of what we're doing but that's
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
the sort of fun stuff that we're dealing
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
with we do this with webinars we do this
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
with policy summits
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
and we do this with our annual meeting
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
speaking of which our annual meeting is
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually going to be
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
in manchester new hampshire this year
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
normally we s we rotate the location of
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
the annual meetings um
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
last year well it would have been in
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
canada the last time we met in person it
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
was in pennsylvania before that it was
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
in connecticut before that it was in new
 
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.110 align:start position:0%
in connecticut before that it was in new
york

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
york
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
and so this time
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is going to be the host
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be at the doubletree
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
in manchester and i have the information
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
here for you guys um
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
and also talking about what we're going
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with i left off this sheet
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be talking about
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
climate and the future of farming with
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
global warming and how
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
farming has to change in order to adapt
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
um to the different
 
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
um to the different
climate

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
climate
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
yeah in fact i'll add to that
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
farm bureau
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
howard probably remembers
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
three years ago maybe had
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
usda climatologists come in and talk to
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
us about
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
the change in the climate means to
 
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
the change in the climate means to
agriculture

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
agriculture
and

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
i we we
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
we've got an invitation ready to go to
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
him but uh we're going to try and bring
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
him back for our annual meeting to talk
 
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
him back for our annual meeting to talk
about

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
what what does that mean and if we do
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
need how do we adapt if we need to
 
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.310 align:start position:0%
need how do we adapt if we need to
uh

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll see what happens with
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
and what and you can add the next one
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
on what i was distracted sorry oh we're
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're also
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're also doing rural broadband
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we we just discussed that um
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
this focus is going to be on the money
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
end of it
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
um and it's very interesting
 
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.230 align:start position:0%
um and it's very interesting
because

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
like i said before the large providers
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
were the ones who would get the money
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
from like the usda and the fcc and all
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
of that for rural broadband
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's the money is being given to the
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
commerce department in washington who's
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to give it directly to the states
 
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.710 align:start position:0%
going to give it directly to the states
and

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's like the
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
providers so used to getting the money
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
are not happy about that
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have a nice discussion
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
including them to talk about their
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
position like why they deserve to have
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
the money and then we're going to be
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
talking to municipalities and cities
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
saying this is why we need the money so
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
another

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
another thing that we normally do at our
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
meetings in will this year
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
our but we have three
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
work sessions uh the first one is always
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
a round table of states and provinces
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
we go around and get all 18
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that we're responsible for
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
and they give us a three-minute update
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
on what's going on in their state what
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
are the important things that they're
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
working on and what and what are the big
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
issues they have
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then we follow that
 
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.269 align:start position:0%
and then we follow that
with

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
one of the csg people who's down in
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
washington comes in and he talks about
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
everything agriculture that's happening
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
in washington
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
oh speaking of which this coming year is
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
going to be the farm bill they're going
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
to be voting on a new farm bill and that
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
is so important to every aspect of our
 
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
is so important to every aspect of our
lives

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
services like
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
school meals school breakfast school
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
lunches things like that um
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
snap benefits all of those are covered
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
by the farm bill you're talking
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars that is going to be
 
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.389 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars that is going to be
decided

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
decided
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the farm bill and if it's got i think
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
10 titles 11 titles something like that
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
underneath this one mega bill
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
dealing with conservation dealing with
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
commodity prices can it's so huge but if
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
we in the northeast don't work together
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
to actually come up with what we want in
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
this farm bill
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
we won't get any recognition because
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
each of our states is small like if new
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire goes into washington and says
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know we would like some money for
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
specialty crops they would laugh us out
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the room because we're so small but
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
if we as a whole group go in with new
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
york pennsylvania
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
all of the new england states and
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
maryland and delaware
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
they'll think twice about you know
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
laughing us out of the room because we
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
have more representation yeah to that
 
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.190 align:start position:0%
have more representation yeah to that
point

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
if you take our
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation from the 11
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
northeastern states we're 21
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
of congress
 
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
of congress
so

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
working together we have some clout
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
not working together we have none
 
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.230 align:start position:0%
not working together we have none
uh

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
uh
yeah

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
who's going to listen to
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
two reps from new hampshire but when you
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
put us all together we've we've got a
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
lot of clout
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
so in the annual meeting in addition to
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
discussing these things we come up with
 
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
discussing these things we come up with
resolutions

00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
that actually get sent on to congress
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
telling what we want
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
last year we came up with a resolution
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
requiring truth and labeling so if
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
something is saying it's soy milk
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not from a lactating animal
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
then it's not milk and no one is
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing that actual rule
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
people continue to use the word milk
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
when they shouldn't be and so we were
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
sort of demanding that they enforce this
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
rule because that's what the definition
 
00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
rule because that's what the definition
is

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
speaking of
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
labeling i brought this i just saw this
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
this morning i thought it was hilarious
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to share with you guys um
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
and while she's doing that
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
the last time we did a farm bill which
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
was five years ago
 
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.110 align:start position:0%
was five years ago
uh

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
we also came up with a resolution for
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
the northeast of what we wanted to see
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
in the farm bill
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
and to make sure congress got it tara
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
went to a
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on the farm bill that the house
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
ag committee in washington put on except
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
they were at suny coble skill so we went
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
sat through their hearing
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
we spoke at the hearing and we gave them
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
a resolution so they all had a copy
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
so that that you're just reading i think
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
is hilarious a friend of mine who is a
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
sheep farmer out of surrey new hampshire
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
actually wrote this comment
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
in response to an advertisement that the
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
keen co-op
 
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.470 align:start position:0%
keen co-op
actually

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.269 align:start position:0%
actually
put

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
in their advertisement
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
and he's not enamored of the product i
 
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.050 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.110 align:start position:0%
don't think
[Laughter]

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the sort of thing we do what i
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
want to do is find out what you guys
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
have been doing this year
 
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.590 align:start position:0%
have been doing this year
um

00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'm always curious as to what ena has
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
before it i understand that you have
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
some solid waste issues some pet
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
issues they sound familiar to me because
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with them all before in the
 
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.550 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with them all before in the
past

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.749 align:start position:0%
past
so

00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
mr chair do you want to maybe give us a
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
quick rundown of the things that have
 
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
quick rundown of the things that have
been

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
sailing through and things that have
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
been maybe not so sailing through this
 
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
been maybe not so sailing through this
year

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
certainly well i want to thank you for
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
the presentation actually can i ask you
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
a question first on the uh yes csg east
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
annual meeting yes so it says august
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
12th through 14th yes but the 15th and
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
16th of the actual meeting so is it
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually the 12th through the 16th that
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
was a mistake a typographical error on
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
my part disregard that as 15th and 16th
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not 12 through 14. it's 15 and
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
16 15 16. thank you very much no problem
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
i was trying to make sure i was
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
understanding what i was reading it it
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
does start a little earlier than that
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
and the 12th may be a good number
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
because we have an executive committee
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and uh uh
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
an opening dinner on sunday and so
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
we we started early gotcha okay
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
fair enough so on our committee i think
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
you've actually kind of highlighted what
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
we've done is solid waste and a few
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
animal issues that's been primarily what
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
we've done we have had a couple of other
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
bills relating to state fairs and
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
providing setting up a grant funding for
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state fairs for um
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
some capital issues that they may have
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
in fact that's in the senate that's
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
great good i saw that there was
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
something on soil what happened to that
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
and what was that about actually
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
bixby might want to cover that it was
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
there's a it's a study committee bill on
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
the soil condition
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
well actually our there are two bills
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's one was last
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
there was a bill
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
that um updates the um
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
the soil statutes to include the
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
definitions of healthy soil and
 
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.710 align:start position:0%
definitions of healthy soil and
uh

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
essentially it set things up
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the soil statutes so that
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
or in the soil conservation statute so
 
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.510 align:start position:0%
or in the soil conservation statute so
that

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
the um conservation districts which are
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
already doing a lot of stuff with
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
healthy healthy soil can include
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the charge in the statute to deal
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
with healthy soil when they're doing
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
when they're making uh when they're
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
filling out grant applications and that
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
would that the idea is that will
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
strengthen their hand in the grant in
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
the granting process because it is then
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
part of their mission right uh so that's
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that one was about
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
this year there is a study committee
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
which uh will be heard by the senate at
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
some point but i don't see why they
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
would turn it down we only put one
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
senator on it
 
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
senator on it
and

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
but that is looking at the soil
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
conditioner stat chapter
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
because when howard and i were doing a
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill last year
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually the soil the soil
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
the healthy soil statute
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
there was a last minute amendment that
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
the senate brought in
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
that would make biostimulus soil bio or
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
plant biostimulants uh a different
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
category and that went into the soil
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
conditioner statute and when we we
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
started looking at the stat that that
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
chapter we realized well there's no
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
definition of a soil conditioner for one
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.029 align:start position:0%
definition of a soil conditioner for one
thing

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
and there are a few other um
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
recognizable shortcomings of it and it
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't been really studied for a couple
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
decades so we thought okay time to
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
kind of do with this what we did with
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
the slaughter statute exactly three or
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
four times ago yeah we did solid waste
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
too the same way we studied it and
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
studied it and came up with revisions to
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
make sense so uh so that's that was
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's what the the
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
soil um good bills are and i actually we
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
had a study committee last fall on
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
on slaughter facilities and we came to
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
conclusion that this is a very real
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem and it has several
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
significant factors leading into it but
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's not much we can do as a
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
legislature to uh to mitigate those such
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
as you know a lack of workforce and
 
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
as you know a lack of workforce and
the

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.390 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
basically it's there need to be private
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
individuals who are going to come
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
forward and start
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
and and you know make the slaughter
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
facilities right and
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
we can't legislate that we've spent what
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
when we were in trying to get a state
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
meat inspection program up and running
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the states so that we would have
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
control and not the usda
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
food safety which currently is and that
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
was shot down in washington we looked at
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at that we looked at this
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
doing a state program again and
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh came to the conclusion that it is not
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
financially viable for a state the size
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to be doing i remember
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
that we thought the same with vermont
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
they started it out first they have a
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
state meet inspection program their
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
department alone for the state meet
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
inspection program i think had 14
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
full-time employees
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
and we were thinking in new hampshire
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass that but actually
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that department is self
 
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.430 align:start position:0%
that department is self
it's

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.789 align:start position:0%
it's
self-funding

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
self-funding
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
from all the licenses and everything and
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really cost the state
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
anything to run it
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
and yet they now have the ability to use
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
their own people to
 
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.190 align:start position:0%
their own people to
inspect

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
inspect
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
their processing facilities and they're
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
even getting agreements so that they can
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
sell the state meat inspection meet
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
across state lines which is even better
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it would be good but
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to happen here or not
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
what else howard so we um we did finally
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
get the
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
raw ice cream raw milk ice cream bill
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
through signed and it is now law good
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
for you so that that one is finally done
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
is that retail
 
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
is that retail
yes

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's you know they'll allow them to
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
make raw milk ice cream and sell it
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's a few stipulations we
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
put on for uh you know the warnings and
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
things of that disclaimer okay
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
disclaimer and there's package sizing i
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
think it was right six ounce max if i
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
remember right so that it would be
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
considered individual servicing
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
have there been any
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
um unfortunate incidents of like
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
salmonella or anything with raw milk
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
that you know of over the last few years
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
there was a small one that occurred was
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
remember where it was
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
i can't recall where it was okay so um
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
bran moore farm in rollinsford rollins
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
yep had one heifer who
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh had a um
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh i i forget exactly what the what it
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
might have been chlamydia or listeria or
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
there was there was some
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
there was some bacterial problem with
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
one of their one of their heifers and
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
they did not catch it immediately
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
and then they had a couple of a few
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
customers saying i got sick and they
 
00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.909 align:start position:0%
customers saying i got sick and they
immediately

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
sent out a recall notice and basically
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
did everything you're supposed to do
 
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.590 align:start position:0%
did everything you're supposed to do
that

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
to uh to mitigate the situation
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh it and
 
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
uh it and
uh

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
so they decided that um
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know they thought they had had the
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
impression that they were doing all the
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
controls necessary that they needed and
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
that this had slipped through so they've
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
decided not to do raw milk anymore
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh but um
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that this so the
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
department the food safe safety division
 
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.909 align:start position:0%
department the food safe safety division
uh

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
got all gun shy about raw milk of course
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
they did yes they tend to yes what this
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually demonstrated was
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
what they told us in committee several
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
years previously which is that if it is
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
a small
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh if it is a a small operation right
 
00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.669 align:start position:0%
uh if it is a a small operation right
and

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:03.269 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
reasonably well traceable right then
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
you're just balancing risks exactly and
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
what happened here was that
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
the that that basically
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
went into effect there was a there was
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
an incident and
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
the you know it's a known risk and they
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
dealt with it
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
really appropriately right and you know
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
a few people got sick but it was not
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
like a massive thing all over the state
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
or the country do you still have it so
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
that it is only saleable at the farm
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
farm stand or farmers market yes okay
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
good yeah we didn't change that and we
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
just added basically ice cream to the
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
existing statue good good yum probably
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
one other major thing that we did was um
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
this year we had a bill come through
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the senate now uh setting the
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant levels for pfcs and
 
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.269 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant levels for pfcs and
soil

00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
soil
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
because that is related to the
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
saint-gobain issue and there was some
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
resulting soil contamination that
 
00:24:58.799 --> 00:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
resulting soil contamination that
occurred

00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i know it came from airbound
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
sources and so
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
we are working on that and recognizing
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
that it was an issue and so we've set
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
finally set some things in place so that
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
des would have something to work with
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
and again it's working its way through
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
the senate now how does that impact
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
farms or does it so the only concern
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
that i had with it potentially could be
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
like land spread sludge things of that
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
nature could potentially
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
contain pfcs as we saw in in maine that
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
occurred and okay so
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
that was really the area that i saw it
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
potentially could but otherwise i don't
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
think it will is sludge still a
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
successful operation here in
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh it's still generally
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
used yes amongst typically it's dairy
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
farmers who are using it on yes exactly
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not allowable on vegetable
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
land as well and anything that's going
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
to touch the ground you know any crops
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
right that's kind that's certainly the
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
largest use of it most definitely uh
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that most of the other issues
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've had were related to solid waste
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we had several bills before the
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee this year on that and um we we
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
put out sort of a major
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
encompassing study committee bill that's
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to look at several issues related
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
to the sighting of landfills and the
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
associated risks and things that go with
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
it when we were in
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
because of the casella
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
problem in bethlehem
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
we came up with a bill that would have
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
community agreement
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
expansion huge expansion to the existing
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
landfill or siding of a new one the
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
community themselves had to agree to it
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
with the the company coming in
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately didn't pass but i
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
thought you need to have the community
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
buy into this
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
you know and you have to be
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
sort of working together instead of just
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
being foisted upon and both sides being
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
angry that's what it seems to be so well
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
certainly all of these issues are are
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
still there they're still very much a
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
forefront we've had you know a lot of
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens that have come in and
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
testified before the committee and i
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
mean i think the committee has
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
really enjoyed a good amount of
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
information from the industry
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
professionals as well as the impacted
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
citizens within the community so it's
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a good experience for us to
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
have that information so so um i was
 
00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:25.830 align:start position:0%
have that information so so um i was
just

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
i was just testifying in the senate on
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed out of our
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
committee and uh passed on a voice vote
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
in the house uh
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
that's 14.54 14.54 which uh basically
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's a it's very simple there's an
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
existing setback of 200 feet and we said
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
we that test setback should actually be
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
determined by with hydrogeological data
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
and there should be a five-year
 
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
and there should be a five-year
window

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
between when any spill would happen and
 
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.789 align:start position:0%
between when any spill would happen and
when

00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
contaminated groundwater would reach a
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive water body and um and
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
that that seems to be a very nicely
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.510 align:start position:0%
that that seems to be a very nicely
targeted

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
targeted
uh

00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
change to
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
to current role good so we've got about
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
two more minutes here if there's one
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
more anything else that you want to wrap
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
up with before we move into our hearings
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
well i'll
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
leave it with uh
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
we still would like to see
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
some of you come to our annual meeting
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
after all it is in your state
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
howard is your appointed representative
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative to our committee at csg
 
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.389 align:start position:0%
representative to our committee at csg
uh

00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
if he can make it we'd love to have him
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
if he can't
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
maybe he can appoint someone to go in
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
his stead but anybody can go yes
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
the problem is there's a cost to that
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea what the speaker
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
has for a budget this year so and we're
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
trying to work with our organization to
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
at least give a huge discount to the
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
representatives in the state
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
and we need volunteers to help people at
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
the registration desk and everything so
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to volunteer in a little
 
00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
if you want to volunteer in a little
position

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
then you get to come to the meeting so
 
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good pitch right there
 
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.549 align:start position:0%
that's a good pitch right there
[Laughter]

00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
well listen we want to thank you both
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and it it really is a great idea
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
when you go to those because the
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
networking with your counterparts in
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
other states is great
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
thanks we appreciate you coming in and
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly try and it is a busy
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
season for me on the farm and the
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
mornings are a challenge but i will
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
certainly try but you don't have to
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
travel far that is a good thing that is
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
very true thank you so much for allowing
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
us to come and and come back home thank

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
so we've got about one minute before
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to gabble in with the next
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill anyone who wants to speak on it i
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
would ask you to send a pink card up in
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
this direction so that we can get you on
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%

department of environmental services to
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
contract with an engineer or hydro
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist when evaluating a permit

for lin for a landfill
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
when this issue was brought forward last
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
year we had outstanding questions
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
regarding the science behind the policy
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
when i was placed in the committee of
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
conference i made a commitment to bring
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
forward legislation this session that
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
would help move forward on this critical
 
00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
would help move forward on this critical
issue

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
our state parks are one of the most
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
significant public assets we have and we
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
should take take responsible steps to
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
protect the natural beauty that new
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is known for
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
but we that
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
it also recognizes the skyrocketing cost
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
of recycling expenses
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that at times the
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services has
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
limited access to the necessary
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
resources needed to conduct the kind of
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
analysis outlined in this bill
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
this legislation puts the cost on the
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
applicant for the department to retain
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
an independent licensed professional
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
engineer or hydro geologist
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
in determining what information is
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
necessary to render the application
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
technically complete
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
assessing whether the application meets
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the requirements for approval and
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the department processes
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
the application in a timely manner
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
this helps to ensure that a thorough
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
process when making a determination
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
about where to site these landfills
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
i am not sitting here today as an expert
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
i am sitting here as a legislator hoping
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
to give the experts the tools they need
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
in order to make informed decisions in
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
the best interests of both the
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
environment and the people of new
 
00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
environment and the people of new
hampshire

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll answer any questions i
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
can but there's hopefully some great
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
experts in this field behind me
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
thank you senator dude we have any
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions for senator
 
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.589 align:start position:0%

kavanagh
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes so i happen to be in
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
the hearing for a house bill that
 
00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
the hearing for a house bill that
requires

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
a hydrogeologist to
 
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.869 align:start position:0%
a hydrogeologist to
do

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
test well samples around a prospective
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh landfill site is that the sort of
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill could help with
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly where we were last year
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
we had the the um it was kind of an
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number of two miles in a in a
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
broad section of area and this is really
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
gives it to the experts in environmental
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
science the the chance to look at that
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
area and tell us where it should be
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
where it shouldn't be right thank you
 
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.829 align:start position:0%
where it shouldn't be right thank you
thank

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
you any further questions
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative comptal
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
um in reading this bill i'm looking at
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
the department may enter
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
and uh into a written agreement and then
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
it says if the applicant's failure to
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
enter in such agreement may be grounds
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
to deny the application
 
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
to deny the application
um

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ifs in this
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
um how do we
 
00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
um how do we
know

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
how does the applicant know if they
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
choose not to that their
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
application won't be denied because it
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they shall it says that they
 
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they shall it says that they
may

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
and how do we know what the expense will
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
be to the
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
applicant thank you for the question and
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
we i did work with the department on
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
that because originally i had in there i
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
said had shell and they thought it would
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
be easier for the department if they did
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
have the resources that they can say may
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why it was changed to may the
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
the price
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
again would have to find out from
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
experts in the field what that would be
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i would have no idea what that price
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be until we um probably got a
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
quote from someone from the department
 
00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
quote from someone from the department
or

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%

367 relative let's see uh
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
relative to regulatory status advanced
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
recycling and manufacturing facilities
 
00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:38.230 align:start position:0%
recycling and manufacturing facilities
so

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
i paired before you to introduce 367
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
relative to the regulatory status
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling and manufacturing
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
facilities when this bill was brought
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
before me i was glad to prime sponsor it
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot of bipartisan support
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
for this and i'm thankful for all those
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
who did co-sponsor with me
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is about
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
incentivizing private investment to come
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire and develop another
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
tool for keeping plastic out
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
of the landfills
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
i was really excited to hear that there
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
is an alternative we have
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
people that are interested in looking at
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that these plastics
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
are out of the landfills and
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
in advance and creating an advanced
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
recycling facility there are others here
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
who are going to speak to the specifics
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the industry and how the advanced
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
recycling works
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill is very simple it
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
is to establish a clear
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory path
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
that this type of recycling facility is
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
treated as a manufacturing facility and
 
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.470 align:start position:0%
treated as a manufacturing facility and
not

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
a solid waste facility
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
18 other states have passed similar laws
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
with the intent to attract private
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
investment to the states that would
 
00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:56.150 align:start position:0%
investment to the states that would
bring

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
good jobs in stem fields and
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
construction as well as other
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
ways to recycle the hard to handle
 
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
ways to recycle the hard to handle
plastics

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
plastics
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
there are no such philoso no other such
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
facilities in the northeast and we
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
should want this type of manufacturing
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
definitely in new hampshire
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
sb 367 passes
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
past the senate unanimously on a
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan voice vote
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
we did amend the bill to address
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
questions brought forward by the
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
about their authority and the department
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
was involved in drafting drafting the
 
00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.630 align:start position:0%
was involved in drafting drafting the
amendment

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
and support this bill i'm pretty sure
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
they still do and my goal is to pass
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation to help new
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire it can help with our solid
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
waste needs by diverting the hard to
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
recycle plastics from our landfills it
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
can help recycle and
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
reuse the plastics and help our economy
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
by bringing good manufacturing jobs
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
in stem fields it's a win-win for new
 
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.910 align:start position:0%
in stem fields it's a win-win for new
hampshire

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
we labored hard on this bill and when i
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
thought well there are plastics as you
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
know that go into the landfill that will
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
never be recycled
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
they will never be recycled they're
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
there and they're they're causing harm
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is an idea
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
that will
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
take that stuff
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
from the landfills or or prevent it from
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
going into the landfills which have a
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
lifespan in itself
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
and recycle it and reuse it
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of people you know aren't familiar
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
with what's going on with the landfills
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
and and the lifespan of those landfills
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
and of course when you continually dump
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
plastics that are not recyclable into
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
them they just
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
create a situation where the lifespan of
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
that that landfill will
 
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.549 align:start position:0%
that that landfill will
diminish

00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
diminish
 
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:44.069 align:start position:0%
diminish
um

00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
we come up with good ideas
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the things that that
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
troubles me is that when we come up with
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
a good idea we got legislators later on
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
that didn't think they were a good idea
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
and we we tend to pull the rug out from
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
from underneath these good ideas and i
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
think like the bile plants is this is a
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
similar situation
 
00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:04.950 align:start position:0%
similar situation
the

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
the thinking outside the box
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
got me really excited about this bill
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
it really is is an idea that that its
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
time has come to pass and i think this
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
is uh i just hope that you you see it
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
the same way that i do
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we have an opportunity
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
to preserve our landfills and to protect
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
our environment with this type of
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislation so with that
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions but if you have
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
any real technical questions i think the
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
department is here that can answer those
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
as well but thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
senator i'll open up with one um did you
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
work with the des on drafting the new
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
language for this bill yes
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
so you've addressed i know they're going
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
to speak but you're comfortable with
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
indirectly yes i did yeah yeah so you're
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the language changes
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
and their recommendations very much and
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
we hope that you are too thank you
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks for taking
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
my question senator
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
i can okay um i'm glad you shared a
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
similar concern with reducing the the
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
plastic from the waste stream in new
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's a great laudable aim um
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative could you get closer to
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
your mike yeah sorry about that i'm
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
reading your lips at this point
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
are you are you familiar with the
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
reduced reuse recycle paradigm for for
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
solving waste issues
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
i've in passing yes not i'm not but i've
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
heard something similar to that where
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
would a plant of this type
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
fit into that paradigm
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh anywhere yeah
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
because we don't have one in new
 
00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.789 align:start position:0%
because we don't have one in new
hampshire

00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
up in our whole area we don't have
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
anything that that supports us so this
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
is an idea that that we we need
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
well i mean to solve the waste crisis
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
however where would it fit in the
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
paradigm of reduced reuse recycle
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
because the idea is that reduction is
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
the is the number one
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's important but it would be in the
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
recycling area this is this is the third
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
one down it's the lowest one down uh i
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
guess if you want to categorize it that
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
way it's still part of the paradigm
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
right okay so it doesn't work without it
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
right but in terms of solving the waste
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
crisis we always try to reduce before we
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
want to reduce that's right but there
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
are plastics that that
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how to recycle at this
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
point and to be able to reuse
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
and recycle that's that's part of it
 
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:26.950 align:start position:0%
and recycle that's that's part of it
right

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the senator uh
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.390 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
um

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh let me say at the outset that i like
 
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.349 align:start position:0%
uh let me say at the outset that i like
the

00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
concept of uh being able to really
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
recycle things that are not
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
as easily recycled as
 
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.309 align:start position:0%
as easily recycled as
um

00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:51.589 align:start position:0%
um
as

00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of types of bottled
 
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of types of bottled
plastic

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
but i just have some questions about
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
the about the language of the bill um so
 
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.150 align:start position:0%
the about the language of the bill um so
in

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
let's see first page at line
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
15. uh
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the chapter
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facilities shall not
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
be considered facilities
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh solid waste facilities solid waste
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
management facilities i'm not quite sure
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
why just plain facilities would not
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
would be there is that something to do
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
with a
um

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
thing the way things are written in
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
current rule uh so shall not be
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
considered facilities and then commerce
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
solid waste facilities yeah yeah um
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's a uh
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
don't normally know okay yeah and and if
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
that might be a redundancy or something
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
to that effect uh maybe that could be
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
struck but i'm not sure okay so so maybe
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's something i should bring up with
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
someone from the department
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh the next um
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
question the next thing is at line 23
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the bold italics products
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
derived from advanced recycling shall
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
not be considered
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
waste derived products or require
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
certification as waste derived products
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
why is that line there
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
i think part of the discussion that we
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
had is that these are not
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
these are not
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
this is a manufacturing bill this is for
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
those products
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
that pertain
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
to manufacturing and they're considered
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh products
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh not
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's not refuge it's basically uh uh
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
trying to think of the word uh
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
secondary raw materials raw material
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it's raw material
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
the the idea that this is going to end
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
part of a waste management
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is this is for
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
specifically recycling things that would
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
end up in waste management instead it
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
goes towards recycling
 
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.990 align:start position:0%
goes towards recycling
so

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's uh we want recycling we don't have
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
it in new hampshire okay follow up
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
yes so um
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things so we have a the way
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're familiar with our waste
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
management pyramid that uh
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
has you know the you know basically
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
landfilling at the bottom and reusing at
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
the top or not making it
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
not having it waste in the first place
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the top and somewhere in the middle
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
of that is
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh is recycling and reuse
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.549 align:start position:0%
and and
um

01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
so and this would be specifically
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
recycling not reuse and they're two
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
different categories but we're not go i
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't want a quibble about that what i
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh my question is actually about uh so
 
01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.190 align:start position:0%
uh my question is actually about uh so
that

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
the current waste management plan has
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
waste reduction and diversion goals and
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
i assume that the next one is going to
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
have those as well and i'm wondering
 
01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:48.470 align:start position:0%
have those as well and i'm wondering
whether

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
material that is diverted from the waste
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
stream for this purpose would still be
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
considered diverted from the waste
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
stream and count towards our ability to
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
get you know keep things out of
 
01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:00.789 align:start position:0%
get you know keep things out of
landfills

01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
with this line in here about it not
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
being considered waste
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'll let the
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
other people speak to that specific part
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill but i do believe that what
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is reduce the amount
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
of plastics
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
that go into the landfill that cannot be
 
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.829 align:start position:0%
that go into the landfill that cannot be
recycled

01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
recycled
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
this is thinking outside the box
 
01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:23.430 align:start position:0%
this is thinking outside the box
and

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
there there'll be a reduction at least
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
of uh the plastics that are going into
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
the landfills
 
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:32.630 align:start position:0%
the landfills
so

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh you we have some experts to talk
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
about whether there's a byproduct or or
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
something to that effect that will uh i
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
think will address some of your concerns
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
right so i'd
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify mike i'm not i'm not
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
saying that it i i just want to make
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
sure that when we use this process to
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
avoid putting plastics into landfills
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting credit for it
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
oh we're going to get credit for it of
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
course this is a big feather i just
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to have an inverting piece of
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
language sort of
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
preventing that um
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay so did you have more you wanted to
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
i think i think the rest of my questions
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
may be better directed to uh someone
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
further down the line thank you very
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
much representative bixby any further
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
questions for senator mr chair there was
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
one over there on the right oh i'm sorry
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
representative murray i couldn't see you
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
no that's okay thank you thank you
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so and
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
this may or may not be something that
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
you are able to answer but i was curious
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
with regards to on page line four
 
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
with regards to on page line four
starting

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
starting
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me page three lines four through
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
thirteen roughly there
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
when it's defining solid waste there is
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
reference to potential burial locations
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
within 75 feet of any drinking water
 
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.710 align:start position:0%
within 75 feet of any drinking water
supply

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i was curious as to how that might
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
jive with
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other things we're
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
considering elsewhere with respect to
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
the 75 feet
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
and additionally
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
there is an intent to bury anything why
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
why that statute is in there i'm going
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
to let the department handle that one if
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah they're
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
pretty reverse to the the technical
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
parts i think there was another one over
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
here yep i have representative stapleton
 
01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:20.230 align:start position:0%
here yep i have representative stapleton
first

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything in the bill here
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
about incineration
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
or high heat destruction
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
this sounds like an industrial process
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
what you're forwarding in the bill
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
for breaking down and reutilization of
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
these components is that correct that's
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
my question um in the beginning you said
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh you uh you were asked to bring this
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill forward can you tell us who asked
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
you to bring the bill forward
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh i could uh
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
jodie grimbles brought it to my
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
attention and she represented who was
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
jodie grimbles she is one of the
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
lobbyists here okay she brought it to my
 
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.710 align:start position:0%
lobbyists here okay she brought it to my
attention

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay so it was the american chemistry
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
council that asked you to okay jody
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right okay thank you
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's another question any further
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative kaplan thank
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
follow-on question
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
would you is it fair to say this is a
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
fairly new industrial process
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
i think there's some other states that
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
have have adopted it adopted the
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
regulation or the actual industrial
 
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.109 align:start position:0%
regulation or the actual industrial
process

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
both okay so how many plants are in
 
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.789 align:start position:0%
both okay so how many plants are in
existence

01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
um my numbers i thought i i understood
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
that there were at least
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
six or nine
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll be i'm going to get here to
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
say it's not it's not a widespread
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
industrial process now we're going to be
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
the leader on that okay but yeah i mean
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's great i have no problem with
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
being the leader in industrial uh
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
processes that work but this is it's not
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
really a tested uh
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
system it's been tested in the lab it's
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
not been tested at commercial scale i
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
believe it has yeah i think you'll hear
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
a testimony that it has okay
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
were you concerned at all uh
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
at some of the
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
potential downside of the byproducts of
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
of a chemical and industrial process
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
with any manufacturing there's always a
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
downside whether you're a a tool and die
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
there's a downside you know there's
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
any type of manufacturing you have
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
there's always a downside there's always
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
a byproduct of something however
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
what we have right now is is a byproduct
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
going into the landfills that will never
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
come out
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we have no solution
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
and we have a bunch of fear about moving
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
forward and it's time we step out of
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
that fear and move forward with with
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
ideas that can
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
protect our environment we have that
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
byproduct already we already have that
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
downside in play and it's been in play
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
for multiple generations
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's time
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's time we come up with an idea that
 
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.470 align:start position:0%
it's time we come up with an idea that
hey

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
we got a plan is there a perfect plan
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's always a downside to every plan
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is thinking outside the box this is
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
a way to say hey look there's a
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
byproduct that's already there's a
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
downside that's already being generated
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
after generation after generation and
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
it's going into the landfills
 
01:06:30.799 --> 01:06:31.670 align:start position:0%
it's going into the landfills
and

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
we can second guess it but all we're
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
doing is with this particular bill
 
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.589 align:start position:0%
doing is with this particular bill
enabling

01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
the conversation to go forward
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
it this does not license any particular
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
plant at this point but this allows the
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
conversation to go forward can we can we
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
fix it yeah
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
are there downsides tell me a bill that
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a downside
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
tell me a manufacturing company that is
 
01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
tell me a manufacturing company that is
100

01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
all you know
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
i just drove to new jersey
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
is there a downside
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh there there may be uh but i'm not
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
aware of any but what we're doing right
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
now we're only setting the stage for the
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
conversation to continue
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
instead of saying no no no
 
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.829 align:start position:0%
instead of saying no no no
no

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
hey let's let's figure out a plan and
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
work together and this had bipartisan
 
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
work together and this had bipartisan
support

01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
which in itself i'll just let you know
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's a big deal
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal thank you senator
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah just one more
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
question which is um
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
why is
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
a redefinition of of the plastics
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
feedstock for this
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh as not solid waste
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
or why actually let me phrase it
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
why is it an impediment to have it
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
i think it changes the narrative of what
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on and it seems as though
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
narratives are are a good way to kill
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
things good ideas and so it isn't it's
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's basically raw material that that is
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
being used uh if if
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's not labeled as raw material then
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
guess what it goes into the landfill
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the region so
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
we can quibble about that part of it
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative but i'm going to tell you
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
right now it's already going into the
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
landfills it's no longer going to china
 
01:08:23.759 --> 01:08:24.789 align:start position:0%
landfills it's no longer going to china
anymore

01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
they stopped that
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's going into the landfills all over
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
the place and
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
there's no plan
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
so i guess let me just narrow down the
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
question a little bit sure um
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
is there something about the fact that
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
it is currently considered solid waste
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
that would prevent a company from using
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
it as
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
a raw material again i'm going to go
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
right back to what i just said
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
this is just this is a purely regulatory
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
question maybe i should drastically yeah
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you should ask them okay uh
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
because i was a little defensive on that
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
because what i'm afraid of is that
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're people that like to change
 
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
they're people that like to change
uh

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
definitions and definitions mean
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
everything semantics are the atom bomb
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
of persuasion i learned that in high
 
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.510 align:start position:0%
of persuasion i learned that in high
school

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
all right so let's say that yes then
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
yeah all right representative murray one
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
final question
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%

folks from the
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%

technical questions um i i can speak to

the work we've done uh
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of drafting the bill and the
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
fact that we feel extremely comfortable
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the access issue and authority to
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%

i'll
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
just make couple remarks and then answer
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
any questions involving that so
 
01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
any questions involving that so
um

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
we myself and mike um winsat did assist
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
with the early
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
drafts of the um
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and we've been working with the folks
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
the whole way
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
there was a concern about
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
our ability to address any
 
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.709 align:start position:0%
our ability to address any
um

01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
public health concerns at the facility
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
um and access to the facility
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
we worked with the folks who drafted the
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill to um
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
for an amendment that was
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
passed in the senate
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we feel very comfortable with the
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
language that isn't that amendment that
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
we would have
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
accessing any concerns at a facility
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
to to address any concerns and verify
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
any public threats etc so
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
we have no concerns with this taking
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
away any authority
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
to perform our regulatory
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities quite the opposite we
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
feel the language in here
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know it reinforces that authority
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the subjects being
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um i'll i'll start
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
with representative kaplan since i saw
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
his hand first but i'll ask you
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative pull your mic a little
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
closer there you go thank you mr chair
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.950 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
um

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i just i'm curious if maybe you can
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
help me out here i was looking at the
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
senate the original bill that was
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
proposed to the senate and
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
the des amendment that went into that
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill the original one seemed to be a lot
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
stronger than what
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
what we see before us here today
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i was just like could i read you what
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
was in there before please
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
it said uh the department may enter and
 
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.550 align:start position:0%
it said uh the department may enter and
inspect

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
inspect
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
oh no this is this is the new one so
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
what you have originally is the
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
department shall regulate advanced
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities as manufacturing
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
facilities advanced recycling facilities
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
in the products and byproducts shall
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
comply with applicable rules and
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
regulations that apply to manufacturing
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
facilities their operations products and
 
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.630 align:start position:0%
facilities their operations products and
byproducts

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
byproducts
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
and this is the the kicker the
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
department may make inspections to
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
which i thought was perfectly
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate exactly what the state
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
requires what uh what you what we
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
require for your department to do its
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
due diligence to protect public health
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the environment the state
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
reserves the right to go in and ensure
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
compliance with all all regulations what
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
we have now seems laughably
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
toothless in comparison and you know let
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
me just read it to you the department
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
may enter and inspect to determine
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
whether storage of materials prior to
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling is a nuisance or
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
poses a threat to the environment
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
the department may utilize its
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority to require
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
abatement of the nuisance or threat
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
is that what we're really concerned
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
about here it's like i mean i can i can
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
imagine an exxon mobil or a chevron
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
coming in here and building one of these
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
plants they probably have some fairly
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
well worked out storage capacity
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
are we really concerned about the
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
nuisance of the storage of the bottles
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
and not the you know the impacts on the
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
air or the ground water or the land use
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
of the products and byproducts it seems
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
my question specifically is why have we
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
walked back that enforcement authority
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the language that we see before
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question um
 
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.709 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question um
certainly

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
certainly
uh

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
the tone
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the two passages different versions
 
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.790 align:start position:0%
of the two passages different versions
you

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
read like
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a difference in in tone
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
but i think in actual
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
authority we feel very comfortable that
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
the new language
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
gives us the same ability to address any
 
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.709 align:start position:0%
gives us the same ability to address any
public

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
any identified concerns to public health
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the other language
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i won't disagree the original is
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
written stronger but i can
 
01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:53.189 align:start position:0%
written stronger but i can
uh

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
i can confirm on behalf of the
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
department and mike wimsat and the
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
entire division that we do not think we
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
are giving away any of our authority we
 
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.229 align:start position:0%
are giving away any of our authority we
still

01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
have the ability to inspect um and we're
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
very comfortable that we haven't walked
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
away from any of our regulatory
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
authority with the new language
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
again agreed tone is a little different
 
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.709 align:start position:0%
again agreed tone is a little different
but

01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter to us in terms of
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities representative bixby
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to follow up on
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh that point a little bit uh so
 
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.310 align:start position:0%
uh that point a little bit uh so
the

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.350 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds like from uh what uh
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan read in the
 
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.590 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan read in the
uh

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the original bill it sounded like
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
requiring compliance was something that
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
emissions from smokestacks uh
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
and uh sort of the
 
01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
and uh sort of the
the

01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
effects of the facility on the
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
surrounding area and it sounds like uh
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
the current language is purely a matter
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
of managing
 
01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.510 align:start position:0%
of managing
uh

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
the solid waste product which is no
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
longer called a solid waste product
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it meets the
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
conditions that are required for solid
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
waste products is that is there
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
something in here that does protect the
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
surrounding air and wall air
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
land and water quality sure all the
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
existing statutes that gives us the
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
to ensure that uh you know we already
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
have those authorities and
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
in in state statute so if there's a
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
stack there they would be required to
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
obtain the necessary permits yeah i mean
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
we we don't have to reiterate this bill
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
is about a specific new
 
01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:51.830 align:start position:0%
is about a specific new
approach

01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why we're comfortable
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
with the language in here reiterating
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
our authority as it comes to what's
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
being addressed in this bill
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't change all the existing
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
rules that give us the authority to
 
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
rules that give us the authority to
regulate

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
on the air and the other items you
 
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.350 align:start position:0%
on the air and the other items you
mentioned

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes uh so
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up the uh
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
by changing the
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
definition to manufacturing as opposed
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
to solid waste
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
it will still fall under
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:17:28.239 --> 01:17:29.430 align:start position:0%
all of the
state's

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
state's
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority for
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities that would
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
include things like preventing uh air
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
and water pollution
 
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
and water pollution
the

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the activities you discussed that
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
could take place at a facility that are
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
subject to existing statute and
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
regulations would continue to be so okay
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
one more okay so um
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask a question that uh
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
the senator felt that you might be more
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate to
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
to cover which is um if we define uh
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
the these plastics uh the the feedstock
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
plastics as
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
not solid waste
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
how do they get counted in the
 
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.510 align:start position:0%
how do they get counted in the
um

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
the state's solid waste diversion goals
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
under the solid waste plan yeah so
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's a little more technical a
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
question than i'm
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
can offer but i
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
can commit to the committee that we will
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
in writing uh with the answer to any
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
specific technical questions as it
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
relates to this okay and would
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a very short one would
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
someone if we were to do a subcommittee
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
on this with someone from the department
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i heard there might be a working
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
session and mike wimsett will be here
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
for that okay thank you representative
 
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.750 align:start position:0%
for that okay thank you representative
murray

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
question with regard to the new
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph that is developed on page two
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
line eight it's paragraph i think
 
01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
line eight it's paragraph i think
five

01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
um it sets a a set of criteria for these
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
plastics that need to be met and i'm
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
assuming that it that all of a through e
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
must be met but it just says which all
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the following apply
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
so in
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
my reading then of subsection d where it
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
says the plastic has been sorted from
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
solid waste and other regulated waste
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
but may contain residual amounts of
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
solid waste such as organic material and
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
incidental contaminants or impurities
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
such as paper labels and metal rings
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
a contaminant percentage much of what we
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
had seen in our recycling and solid
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
waste study committees
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
around plastics recycling regarded
 
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.189 align:start position:0%
around plastics recycling regarded
contamination

01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about the reason
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
for things being refused from recycling
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
facilities it was due to contamination
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious to know if there's a
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.790 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious to know if there's a
number

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
or a percentage
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
that if this plastic comes contaminated
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
what what's that metric there
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
that is a great question for me to get
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
back to you on
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
all right i'll remind committee members
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
to shut their mics off when they're done
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
asking questions because we can only
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
have so many on at a time but
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative dutzy
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding in attending some
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
webinars on this subject is that there's
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
a a lot of emission there's two things
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
that go into it
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
first of all it's a highly intensive
 
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.709 align:start position:0%
first of all it's a highly intensive
energy

01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
source so in other words a lot of energy
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
needs to go into it in order to get the
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
feedstock out that's number one and the
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
second thing is that there's a lot of
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
toxins that go in into the air through
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
this process
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
since it's a new pro would be a new
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
process in the state
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
do we have any uh
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
how would we regulate the amount of
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
emissions that go into the air do we
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
have any standards for that who would
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
set up those standards if we don't have
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
them can you give me any background on
 
01:21:02.159 --> 01:21:03.030 align:start position:0%
them can you give me any background on
that

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
well so i
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
as it
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
relates to the air any intermission
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
pieces to this is
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
they'd be held to the existing
 
01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
they'd be held to the existing
air

01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
air
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
emissions standards we have so
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
um again that's why we're comfortable
 
01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.709 align:start position:0%
um again that's why we're comfortable
with

01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
the language in here
 
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.510 align:start position:0%
the language in here
is

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't impact all of our existing
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory and statutory authority
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
and the standards that already exist
 
01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
and the standards that already exist
so

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
um i i can't give you the you know the
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
spell out the the
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
numerically the standards but i mean you
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
know the existing state statute and
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
again happy to follow up with
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
specifically uh
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm rep stapleton
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
i noticed the processes described in the
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
talk about deprivation of oxygen
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a high heat melt factor instead
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
of an incineration because you want to
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
preserve the material for feedstock
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i would assume that
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
that means that the released
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
atmosphere is
 
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.430 align:start position:0%
atmosphere is
minimal

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
if at all
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's contained is that correct that's my
 
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
it's contained is that correct that's my
understanding

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
i notice that
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
on page two down at the very bottom of
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
the bill at
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
roman 8 b
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
sub b
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
materials for which the united states
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency has made
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
a non-waste determination
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
pursuant 40 cfr 241
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
or has otherwise determined our feed
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
stocks and are not solid waste
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
followed up
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
on the next page page 3 at the top at
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
sub d
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
recovered feedstock is not mixed with
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste or hazardous waste on site
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
or during processing at an advanced
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
recycling facility
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
at roman 22 the definition of solid
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
waste pretty clear
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
that these become distinct and separate
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
type of materials
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
type of materials
i

01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that not clear
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
language for what we're describing here
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
i'll be comfortable with it i
 
01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:37.590 align:start position:0%
i'll be comfortable with it i
it

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
i all i can say is
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know director wimsat and all the
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
folks at uh the es were all very
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the way it spelled out
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
as you laid it out yeah thank you
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um i just
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
have a question about
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
regulation of manufacturing facilities
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
versus solid waste facilities
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
i know for solid waste facilities that
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
you have the des has the right and not
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
the right but you know it's part of the
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
plan that you go in once a year and you
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
actually measure
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
the smokestack emissions for instance or
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
you contract out with somebody to do
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
that for you but
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
you have that's part of the plan they go
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
in and do that if a manufacturing
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
facility is is it the same thing where
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
the des goes in and measures themselves
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
the emissions or is this a matter of
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
self-reporting more from the industrial
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
you know they're you're using the term
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing generically it depends and
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't that's not criticism i'm
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
just saying well that's that's how it
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
stated here yeah it is very yeah so it
 
01:24:38.639 --> 01:24:40.229 align:start position:0%
stated here yeah it is very yeah so it
would

01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
our what we would be regulated would be
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
determined by what permits they received
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
to operate at the facility so
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.229 align:start position:0%
you know
you

01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
if you know a manufacturer would you
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
know propose plans to develop a facility
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
we'd let them know what permits would be
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
required for that and then uh depending
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
on what activities and what technologies
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're using
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
and then we would based on whatever
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
perimeter permits were received
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
the regulatory follow-up would be
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
dependent on you on what those permits
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
were so basically we have no idea the
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework here seems like a
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
work in progress to be honest with you
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's like it's more about what it isn't
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
than what it is we don't know what this
 
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.189 align:start position:0%
than what it is we don't know what this
is

01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't know what these facilities
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
are because they don't really yeah i
 
01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
are because they don't really yeah i
mean

01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.629 align:start position:0%
mean
i

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
l as i mentioned earlier we are very
 
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.910 align:start position:0%
l as i mentioned earlier we are very
comfortable

01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
comfortable
that

01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
relinquishes any authority we have
 
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.830 align:start position:0%
relinquishes any authority we have
to

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulate various manufacturing
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
facilities and
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
if anything involving here requires a
 
01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
if anything involving here requires a
permit

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
um under those activities it'll be
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
subject to those
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
those restrictions so
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is a bill identifying a new
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
approach to dealing with these materials
 
01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.189 align:start position:0%
approach to dealing with these materials
and

01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh we wanted a reference in there
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
about our ability to inspect
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
if we were if there were any concerns
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
identified and the language that was put
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
in in the in the senate we feel very
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable does that
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:16.550 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
murray

01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
question and thank you um so yes again
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
on page two going back um to lines uh 25
 
01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
on page two going back um to lines uh 25
26

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
26
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about pyrolysis
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
and um it sounds to me like this is an
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
anoxic environment that this would be
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
taking place in however there is a
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
mention that
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
there is cooling and condensation then
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
happening so to me there is a potential
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
byproduct or something potential that
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
might leave and head into either a stack
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
or an environment or be recaptured some
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
other way it's not really
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
elucidated here
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i guess that is my question
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
following up from representative kaplans
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
is in the event that
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
there is some sort of release in some
 
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
there is some sort of release in some
way

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
what do we do if that is not being
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
complied with in a way that um
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
our regulations and the epa's
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
regulations state their with the same
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's why
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
again we wanted to ensure our ability to
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
inspect if we went in there and
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
inspected and identified something that
 
01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.669 align:start position:0%
inspected and identified something that
fell

01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
fell
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
under other regulatory responsibilities
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of air emissions etc
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
we'd follow up based on what we found
 
01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.229 align:start position:0%
we'd follow up based on what we found
so

01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:36.239 --> 01:27:38.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
when there wasn't when there wasn't
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
anything listed in here are about our
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
ability to go in and inspect anything
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
that was identified as a concern to
 
01:27:46.639 --> 01:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
that was identified as a concern to
public

01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
health and uh
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's when we had concerned but
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsors of this bill
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate it
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
that allowing us to make sure that um
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
that we can go in there and inspect
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
based on our existing authorities um and
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we found anything that fell under
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
existing statute or regulations we would
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
follow up accordingly so we feel
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
very comfortable that
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
this will not increase any concern to
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
public health it's an ability to find a
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
new approach to dealing
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
with waste products
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
and we feel very comfortable we can do
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
it in a safe way
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
with oversight um and existing state
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
statutes and regulations and rules um
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
would allow us to follow up if something
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
applicable was applied
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up one follow-up and do
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
you feel like currently you have the
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
staff and the capacity to take on a new
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
industry such as this to monitor all of
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
the same things in addition to
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
everything else that you're charged with
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
well so staff questions are always a
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to talk with the
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislature because i'll go down the
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
hall and they'll tell me we have too
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
many so but um
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
i we we feel very comfortable existing
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
staff would be able to
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
um take this on within
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
our uh the existing roles we have
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and if the industry grew and that
 
01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
um and if the industry grew and that
changed

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
we'd identify that as a need
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes up to budget and staffing
 
01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
when it comes up to budget and staffing
but

01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
um in these early stages we feel very
 
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
um in these early stages we feel very
comfortable

01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
that existing staff would be able to
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
follow up you know as this industry
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully begins here in the state
 
01:29:32.639 --> 01:29:35.750 align:start position:0%
hopefully begins here in the state
representative

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
my question sure are these technologies
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
in use now any of them described in a
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill and for how long yeah i
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
they are and but i'd really i'm assuming
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
acc is going to testify i'd really
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
rather let the american chemistry
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
council folks speak they're going to be
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
much more articulate about
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
the status of this in this country and
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
and other states that have implemented
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
it and and again but i will say this
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
um what our staff has learned the fact
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't be the first state
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
moving forward and that this has been
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
implemented in a safe way did increase
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
our comfort level and and they'll be
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
able to give you a better job about some
 
01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.390 align:start position:0%
able to give you a better job about some
of

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
that what is happening in other parts of
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the country thank you follow up yes one
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
i believe i've heard that there are
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 500 and 1500 different
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
types of plastic resins
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
these processes will
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
comprehend the
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
breakdown of all of them
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
or some of them
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
or not many of them how is the spectrum
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
work on that
 
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.950 align:start position:0%
work on that
again

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question for some
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the more folks or experts on
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
the the technology and processes we're
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't want to get ahead of
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
my skis and i i can speak to
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
like i said you know for the leadership
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
at dds we just wanted to make sure
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
we felt comfortable we weren't losing
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
any authority that you know that that
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
was our leadership's main concern and
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
um and of course always public safety
 
01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.669 align:start position:0%
um and of course always public safety
and

01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know director wimsat um
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
confirmed that he was very comfortable
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the language
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
and very comfortable with what's in here
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
about the technology and if it was
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
implemented here and our ability to keep
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
public safety uh you know address any
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
public safety concerns so
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
for leadership that's where we were
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
coming from uh
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the the sponsors of the bill and uh
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
the folks from acc should we'll be able
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
to give you a better idea of kind of the
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
the process and the the chemistry aspect
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions we
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in thank you thank
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
next we'll bring up uh john swann from
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
dalton new hampshire from save forest
 
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.430 align:start position:0%
dalton new hampshire from save forest
lake

01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
lake
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
no sir i'm going to call you next so go
 
01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
no sir i'm going to call you next so go
ahead

01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is john swann
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
i am the founder of save force lake and
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
i do apologize i'm a little late coming
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
to this bill because as you know
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
we've been focused on a few other bills
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
this was certainly one that caught my
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
gosh first off just starting off
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
there's still so many questions about
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
if we brought you a bill like this that
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
was so discombobulated
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
and no one speaking to testify on behalf
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
of it could answer your questions
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
i mean you would itl or is it
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
table it i mean
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and what's shocking is the fact that and
 
01:33:08.159 --> 01:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
and what's shocking is the fact that and
again

01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned about this bill
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
because first of all
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
we don't know anything about it
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
but second it appears to be
 
01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
but second it appears to be
a

01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
deregulation of solid waste policy and
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
practice and standards in new hampshire
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
i mean we're talking about a process
 
01:33:28.239 --> 01:33:29.030 align:start position:0%
i mean we're talking about a process
here

01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is still relatively unknown it's
 
01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.510 align:start position:0%
that is still relatively unknown it's
new

01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
as you heard from the bill's sponsor who
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer any questions about the
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
bill it's basically being
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
advanced by the american chemistry
 
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.110 align:start position:0%
advanced by the american chemistry
council

01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
so why do they want to come to new
 
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.990 align:start position:0%
so why do they want to come to new
hampshire

01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
and why do they want to
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
change the language on the books what is
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
it about the language that prevents them
 
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.870 align:start position:0%
it about the language that prevents them
any

01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
companies they represent from coming
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire finding a site going
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
through the permitting process
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
why the change to solid waste
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
regulations and that's i hope you're i
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
mean i love the questions that are
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
coming from y'all because
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're really digging
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
into it i would recommend that you watch
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing video from the senate side
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
just because
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
was it the same kind of uh hearing that
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
we just went through with house bill
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
1454 with two hours of grilling and
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
counter questions it was kind of a
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
kumbaya for a project that frankly
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
after that hearing
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
to me sounded like
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
someone's coming to town in new
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they're trying to pave the
 
01:34:37.679 --> 01:34:38.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they're trying to pave the
way

01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
for that project so i think that's a
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
question that needs to be asked maybe of
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
the acc or the sponsor is this a project
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's coming to new hampshire
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
and we all know the threat of pfas
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
proliferation and plastics in new
 
01:34:52.719 --> 01:34:53.910 align:start position:0%
proliferation and plastics in new
hampshire

01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're familiar with that threat
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i mean this bill when i look at this
 
01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.189 align:start position:0%
and i mean this bill when i look at this
language

01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
it just screams beefos at me in some
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
form or fashion
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about plastics
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about chemistry
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
i know uh
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
one representative mentioned it's not
 
01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
one representative mentioned it's not
incineration

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
incineration
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
but as as you've mentioned in discussion
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's high heat melting
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's processes that are taking place
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
what's at the heart of all this
 
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
what's at the heart of all this
pfas

01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:24.950 align:start position:0%
pfas
um

01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i again i appreciate the fact that
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
the waste hierarchy was mentioned and of
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
course at the top is reduction
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that the bill sponsor and
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
the acc bring forth legislation that
 
01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.430 align:start position:0%
the acc bring forth legislation that
would

01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that they're actually going to
 
01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
suggest that they're actually going to
reduce

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing of these plastics that
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
can't be recycled
 
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.149 align:start position:0%
can't be recycled
safely

01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
safely
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
and instead this bill seems to be
 
01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
and instead this bill seems to be
a

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
green lighting of the production of more
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
and more plastics in our society and we
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
know plastics are not good
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
and you know again i i'm not going to
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
belabor the point i did send you
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
a long um testimony this weekend with
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
questions that still remain unanswered
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
why can't a company come to new
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire with existing regulations to
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
site a facility like this
 
01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
site a facility like this
and

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's the key but
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
if there's no other new england state
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
that has a facility like this and we
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
build it it's built not weed please not
 
01:36:28.639 --> 01:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
build it it's built not weed please not
we

01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
if it's built centrally here in new
 
01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.229 align:start position:0%
if it's built centrally here in new
hampshire

01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
is maine going to build one vermont
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
canada massachusetts no they're going to
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
ship that plastic waste
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire so again think about
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
what the ask is here in this bill
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're asking you to change the
 
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.870 align:start position:0%
they're asking you to change the
definition

01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
about a
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
solid waste by-product
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
to something that is on the same level
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
as virgin plastic for
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
not recycling in terms of solid waste
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
but manufacturing i mean that's a big
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
ask that is the deregulation of probably
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
the largest
pain

01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
pain
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
in society's butt right now is plastic
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
waste and what to do with it
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
i mean in vermont they're even having
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know food de packaging and bits of
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
the micro microplastics getting in the
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
process and getting into the soil and
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
there's pfas in the soil
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
so again i i
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm new to this bill i didn't
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
make it to the senate hearing on it i
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
would really recommend that you watch
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
the senate hearing
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
i sent you the cued link but please this
 
01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.350 align:start position:0%
i sent you the cued link but please this
is

01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
does new hampshire want to get into the
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
plastics business and do we want to be a
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
magnet for out-of-state plastic waste
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
which is going to happen instead it'll
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
be declassified as
 
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.149 align:start position:0%
be declassified as
whatever

01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
pre-used polymer
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%

other and that's that's why you're
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
seeing it so i'm trying to get a balance

seeing it so i'm trying to get a balance
there

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay next is going to be margaret gorman

the american chemistry council we're a
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
national trade association we're based
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
in washington dc and cover all different
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
types of chemistries we have a full
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
plastics division i work in our
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%

well so i'm really excited to be here
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
today and thank you for
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
considering sb 367
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
that would essentially classify advanced
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities as manufacturing
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state of new hampshire
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
and not solid waste this is a game
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
changer um right now these facilities
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
can take
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
all different hard to recycle plastics
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
so right now 90
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
of plastics are not being recycled those
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
are the plastics that are in the
 
01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:27.030 align:start position:0%
are the plastics that are in the
landfills

01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
those can come out they're all different
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
types of plastics ranging from so even
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
think in your home right um frozen
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
vegetables those types of bags uh
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
granola bar wrappers um detergent
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%

bottles
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
all those different plastics can be made
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
and are being made into new plastics
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
right now there are existing projects
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
out there that are working philadelphia
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
cream cheese the next time you see a
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
philadelphia cream cheese tub that is
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
coming from advanced recycling in europe
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of our member companies plastic
 
01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.070 align:start position:0%

01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is that is created out of that
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
magnum ice cream tubs that is another
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
existing project that is working in
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
addition to that there are new projects
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
that have been announced in several
 
01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.790 align:start position:0%
that have been announced in several
areas

01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
who doesn't love wendy's
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
wendy's is one they are making their new
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
cups out of advanced recycling
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
technologies they are partnering with
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
one of our member companies lion
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
delbisell to do that herbalescent
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
shampoo bottles that's another example
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
of a new project that has been announced
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the states right now
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
18 states have passed laws similar to
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
the bill that's in front of you today
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
closest to new hampshire is pennsylvania
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
virginia was passed a couple of years
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
ago so in addition to the american
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
chemistry council supporting this bill
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
several organizations throughout this
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
country are also supporting this type of
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the laws that are being passed
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
ranging from business groups to the
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
companies that we represent to
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislators on both sides of the aisle i
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
have seen legislators in other states
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
that have supported plastic bag
 
01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.629 align:start position:0%
that have supported plastic bag
plastic

01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
01:41:14.639 --> 01:41:15.750 align:start position:0%
plastic
bands

01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
bands
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the past who are supporting and
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
sponsoring these type this legislation
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's in front of you today they are
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
saying this is part of the solution this
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
is a new technology actually
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
some of these companies i want to
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
address that have been in
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
production for 10 years
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
so we have right now almost actually
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's 10 facilities throughout the
 
01:41:37.119 --> 01:41:38.070 align:start position:0%
it's 10 facilities throughout the
country

01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
taking plastic so let me just read some
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
examples right now we have altera in
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
akron ohio 60 tons a day types of
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
plastics accepted choose fours fives and
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
sixes braven north carolina twelve
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
thousand tons a year they're taking twos
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
fours five six and sixes brightmark
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
ashley indiana 1 000 tons a year of
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
plastics they are currently taking right
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
now this is not a false statement this
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
is actually happening and those
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
companies want to come to the northeast
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
they want to invest in the northeast
 
01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.350 align:start position:0%
they want to invest in the northeast
because

01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
they see themselves as part of the
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
solution as well so right now there are
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
no facilities that are set up in the
 
01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.590 align:start position:0%
no facilities that are set up in the
northeast

01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
northeast
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
reclassifying them as manufacturing
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
facilities is properly classifying them
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
because they're making new products
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're not making solid waste so that's
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
why you know we thank des for working
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
with us on making sure that they are
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
properly regulated and supporting that
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
additional states in the northeast that
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
have introduced legislation
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
new york new jersey rhode island and
 
01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:45.510 align:start position:0%
new york new jersey rhode island and
connecticut

01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle that are
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
supporting this type of legislation
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i just wanted to before
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know i'm also available for
 
01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.430 align:start position:0%
you know i'm also available for
questions

01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
the other side in the arguments that
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're hearing on the other side
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
incineration it's not incineration they
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
are not burning plastics it is a degree
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
issue incineration is 1500 degrees
 
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.270 align:start position:0%
issue incineration is 1500 degrees
celsius

01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
celsius
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
melting at a thermal process is five to
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
eight hundred
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
the emission rate there's been a recent
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
study it's lower than a college campus
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
and hospitals they're not the emission
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
rates are not that high
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're also subject right now federal
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
loss that's health and safety standards
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
for air emissions which facilities must
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
adhere and report to they're subject to
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
fines permitting revocations and closure
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
if they exceed error emission limits so
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
they're not asking for
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
to be exempted from being you know
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
subject to regulation they're just
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
asking to be reclassified properly
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
because they are making new products
 
01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
because they are making new products
um

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facilities are not
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
producers of any significant amount of
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
especially you know compared to other
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing processes so again they're
 
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
not burning during advanced recycling
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're using thermal energy heat
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
but take place in the absence of oxygen
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
so there's little to no combustion so i
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure to address that
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
because you're going to hear that it's
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
incineration and it's 100 percent not
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
accurate it's not true the emission rate
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
again is lower than a college campus or
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
a hospital
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i am i thank all of you for listening
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
to me today and considering this
 
01:44:27.119 --> 01:44:28.470 align:start position:0%
to me today and considering this
legislation

01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
and we're very excited to be here i'm
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions i kind of had an
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
idea that might be representative big
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
speech thank you for asking for on
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:44:40.639 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:44:43.679 --> 01:44:44.470 align:start position:0%
and uh
so

01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
i actually have several questions but
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'll start with one um you mentioned
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
the the there are various new products
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
that basically the plastic is melted
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
down into constituent chemicals and then
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
new products are made
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
is that all happening in the same
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
facility in other words does the does
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
the pyrolysis or gasoline or solvolysis
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
happen in the facility those chemicals
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
the you know short-term chart chains or
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
you know monomers etc are you know the
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
result of the of that pyrolysis are
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
those then in that same facility turned
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
into the new lid the new bottles for
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
herbal essence or is are those
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
is the product there shipped to a
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
different facility where those other
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
where the final product is made that's a
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
great question and the answer is both it
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh melted into um a fuel at one facility
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
or it can be transferred into a product
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
in that same facility as well so there's
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know different facilities are doing
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
different types of
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
um recycling and that is trending again
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
towards new products
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i should stop for a second because
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
our technical expert actually isn't here
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
today so if there's something i can't
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
answer well certainly as you talk to
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
craig cookson who's my colleague and he
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
is the director of plastic
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
sustainability we'll certainly get those
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
questions that we can get answered for
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
you okay so i'm gonna
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
interrupt for just a second i have every
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
intention of scheduling a work uh
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
session on this bill
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
and since we don't have necessarily all
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the technical experts here today
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
maybe i might just say to the committee
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
why don't we save some of these really
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
technical questions for when we can have
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
the proper folks to answer them in our
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
in our work session and just so that
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
we're not getting bogged down on a lot
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we can't answer
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
today if that would be acceptable that
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
would that would be fine and i will um
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
save my quiz save the
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
you just cover the higher level
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions here thank you uh and one of
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
them you mentioned fuel and
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
 
01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:44.470 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
uh

01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
i did a little bit of reading about
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis etc and uh one of the uses
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
that pyrolysis liquids are sometimes put
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
to is as uh diesel fuel or other sorts
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
fuel for vehicles or that sort of thing
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
is that the sort of thing that these
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
plants would be producing
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
if one were to come to new hampshire it
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
could be and it used to be but that's
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
not the trend that we're seeing now so a
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
lot what we're seeing now are these new
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
products that i mentioned and the new
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
projects that have been announced and i
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
didn't even cover all of them you know
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
ranging from the wendy's
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
project to herbal lessons so yes it
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
beginning did start that way and now it
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
is trending to new products and yes they
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly could do that but what we're
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
seeing and what companies are doing now
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
and just a sort of a um business model
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
question uh so
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot of energy input
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of infrastructure input in
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
terms of collecting all the plastics so
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds kind of expensive uh would
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
directing these towards uh making new
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
products as opposed to diesel fuel for
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
does that just does that improve the the
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
balance sheet for doing this sort of
 
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
balance sheet for doing this sort of
project

01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
it would certainly help the balance
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
sheet of new hampshire economically for
 
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.189 align:start position:0%
sheet of new hampshire economically for
sure

01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:14.229 align:start position:0%
sure
these

01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
the companies that are coming in are not
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
asking for state subsidies or tax money
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
so the economic output of what is coming
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
out of these companies is millions of
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
dollars we could certainly look at new
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire but we've done
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
analysis for example on the state of new
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
york 500 million a year in economic
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
output so it's certainly i think in
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
the benefits of recycling
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
the plastics into new plastics
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
what a great economic output for the
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire as well on top of
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative
 
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.390 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative
kennedy

01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
kennedy
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
my question just got answered thank you
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative murray um yes thank
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my thank you mr chair for
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
taking a question thank you for taking
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
so one question i do have is with regard
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
to plastics that might come in that are
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
multi-layered that have non-stick layer
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
coatings of any kind or that kind of
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing that might then get melted down
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
into a new product
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
what if any
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
duty do we have to let folks know that
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
potentially those products are getting
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
co-mingled together and made into
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
something new
 
01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.310 align:start position:0%
something new
and

01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
are those coatings then transferred into
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
the new neural products that you're
 
01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.709 align:start position:0%
the new neural products that you're
mentioning

01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.719 --> 01:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
the products that are coming in that are
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
being melted down um can be combined but
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
with that let me address if there's
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
other chemistries in that products those
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
chemistries are not going into the
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
emissions right for example um as well
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
they have to meet certain specifications
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
for these manufacturing facilities and
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
again that's something craig can discuss
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
more in the work session but they're
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
also subject again to federal standards
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
and emission rates and other chemistries
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
of concern that might
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking at i think what you're
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
getting at into the emission it is it
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
would not be going into the admissions
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
and they they are certainly subject to
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
inspections and their own requirements
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative bixby if you want to turn
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
your mic off i'm sorry that's okay uh
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i recognize that you're not a
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
technical expert and so i'm going to try
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
to keep it simple but
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's this is not incineration granted
 
01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.270 align:start position:0%
it's this is not incineration granted
correct

01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
is it not a fact that that's the
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
emissions and the byproduct the waste
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
byproduct would contain toxic substances
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
such as dioxins infurians and heavy
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
metals so the emission rates are uh
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
lower or the same as a college campus or
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
hospital um it would contain levels of
 
01:50:47.119 --> 01:50:48.149 align:start position:0%
hospital um it would contain levels of
those

01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's something i'd have to have craig
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
can certainly go into that because those
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
substances are not safe but when you say
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
toxic substance can you re what specific
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
chemistries are you referring are you
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
right pfas
 
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm talking more about dioxins and
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
furons and heavy metals which is the
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that usually comes out when you
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
burn plastics
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
if it was this is an incineration but
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
the emissions still do contain levels of
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
those contaminants
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes or no
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's something that i would have to
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
have craig certainly we can get into
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
more detail on that but the emission
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
rate the emissions do not have other
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
chemistries in them as i've said i mean
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're low there there have been
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
studies out there we can certainly talk
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
more about that as we get to the work
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
session but it's follow-up question sure
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind you representative
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're not interrogating a witness here
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
so let's just keep our questions trying
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be clear for the public thank you i
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you mr chair um
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the saint-gobain
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
plant in merrimack and the p5 i am
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're not a member of acc but i am
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with the plant and the issue
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
here yes i mean that's something that
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with in new
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire that
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
that was a really you know a product of
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
lacks enforcement and you know
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
unforeseen consequences of the chemical
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
industry so would you agree that it
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
might be wise for us to to not jump into
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
something like this with two feet uh and
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
unaware of the potential downside that
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
is something that's potent you know
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
possibly huge
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
so these facilities have been in
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
existence for 10 years and not once have
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
these facilities been subject to any
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
emissions of toxins they are subject to
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement by the federal government
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
they are subject to the clean water act
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
they are subject to the clean water to
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
the clean air act they're not looking
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
for an exemption from
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
any sort of other statutes they're just
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
looking to be classified properly and i
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
think this is a great time to say
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
we have an actual video a great video
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
and looking inside of one of these
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
companies and what they're doing so
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure to send that to you
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
um after but you they're different
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
facilities i mean this is a facility
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
that takes plastics and makes them into
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
new plastics so we've certainly there's
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
been a lot of successful projects out
 
01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
been a lot of successful projects out
there

01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you actually i'm going to ask you
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
a question myself are there any of these
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
facilities being proposed in the new
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
england states currently do you know of
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
any that are on excuse me that are
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
seeking a permit to operate uh not yet
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh we they're in the northeast there
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
have not been any states yet that have
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
reclassified these facilities so the
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
closest right now is ohio there is an
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
existing um facility set up in ohio
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
already but we do know that companies
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
are looking to come here and invest in
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the northeast
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
and would that purpose be so that
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
they're closer to the source of the
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
product correct okay representative
 
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
product correct okay representative
dutsy

01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
dutsy
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you for taking my call
 
01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.270 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you for taking my call
uh

01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
am i to believe that any kind of
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
plastics can go into this process for
 
01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:50.950 align:start position:0%
plastics can go into this process for
example

01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
if i go to christmas tree shop and i see
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
a plastic adirondack chair
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
when that breaks that can go into this
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
process plastic toys can go into this
 
01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.070 align:start position:0%
process plastic toys can go into this
process

01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's all different hard to recycle
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
plastics but the ones that we're hearing
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
the most that they're taking are
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're harder to recycle like your
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
granola bar wrappers for example and
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
lotion bottles polypropylene
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
is a higher rate so it really depends on
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
the commodities but yes they can take
 
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
the commodities but yes they can take
all

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
hard to recycle plastics i don't have
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of chairs that they're taking
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
specifically but it would depend on the
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
facility and what on the outcome that
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
they would be looking at
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
so what happens to my plastic detergent
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
bottle now because it was my
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that it was getting
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
what i can answer is that ninety percent
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
of plastics right now are not being
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
recycled and these facilities can take
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
detergent bottles and recycle them into
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
new ones
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you any further
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative kennedy
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier the revenue that you
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
guys have mapped out to come towards
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
states is there also a tax reduction
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
have you guys looked into any of that
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
other than just the revenue is there a
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
pathway just like how
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
we bring in trash from other states into
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
our landfills the trafficking of that
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
material over the border to come into a
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
facility like this on our state would
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
that give us tax relief other than just
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
an income to the state
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i know our
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
facilities right now are privately
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
investing in other states so they're not
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
looking for tax breaks uh whether or not
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
that would happen in new hampshire you
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
know is a question i can't answer right
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
now but they're
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
certainly when they're looking to come
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
into the states they're not looking for
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
a state to give them a tax break they're
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
what about them also contributing to the
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
state so we get a
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
tax deduction so i can go into helping
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
pay for schools pay for stuff like that
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that it was a private
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
company um that would be up to the
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
company i think in the state once they
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
decide to come and invest it would be a
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
private you know decision between the
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
company and the state and how they want
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
to work that

[Music]
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:56:18.239 --> 01:56:19.669 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:19.679 --> 01:56:20.470 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a metals process of high melt
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
there's often slag and dross that's
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
problematic but in these lower
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
temperatures dealing with the plastics
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
and resins
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
is there not much of that sort of thing
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
because you're melting to reform
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
that is a question where i can have
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
craig address more during the work
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
session but i know this has come up and
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's typically 80 of the plastics
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
that are recovered
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
 
01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.070 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
um

01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
one of the big problems we have are the
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
blades from
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh windmill generation
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
for the power
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i understand they're burying these
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
things because they can't process them
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
for any given use at this point
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
will any of the processes here
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh enable handling
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
of these sort of things
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
handling of
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
the windmills windmill blades that i
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know um i would depend on
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
what the blades are made out of and if
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's plastic that's included so
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
certainly maybe a question for the work
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
session sure as well maybe we can save
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
some of these really technical questions
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the work session that may be a
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
fiberglass component as well as yeah it
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
could be represented bixby yes thank you
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um
 
01:57:42.159 --> 01:57:43.350 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um
i'm

01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of things i'm trying to
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
get my head around here one is uh
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
at what point does the uh
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
does does the classification change from
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
waste to
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
non to feedstock so for instance um
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
is it a matter of when it is collected
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
from you know wherever it gets collected
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
whether it says the
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
municipality has a curbside or a waste
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
transfer station does that does it at
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
that point cease to be solid waste or is
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
it when it enters the factory
 
01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.790 align:start position:0%
it when it enters the factory
and

01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
what if there is not enough capacity at
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
the factory to handle the amount that's
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
coming in so that is definitely a
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
technical question i think i'm going to
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
have to defer to for craig for the work
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
session on the technicalities of the
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
feed stock and and then let me go for a
 
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:38.790 align:start position:0%
feed stock and and then let me go for a
higher

01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i i what i hope is not a technical
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
question which is
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
why is it that what is it about it being
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
regulated as
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing rather than what it no
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
what is it about it being regulated as
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
solid waste right now that prevents
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
someone from just doing it
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
that prevents a company from coming in
 
01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:00.550 align:start position:0%
that prevents a company from coming in
yeah

01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
because they're not being properly
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
classified because the trends are
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
they're making new products and in my
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding solid waste is not
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
considered an actual product that's in
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
front of you so their trend is making
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
plastics into new plastics and they just
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
want to be classified correctly and
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's what 18 states have done we had
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
two states in 24 hours the other they
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
just enacted the same law and four other
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
states in the northeast that are very
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
interested in that because
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's just changing so much with what the
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
new products are are
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
being made into what i'm trying to get
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
at is are there specific regulatory
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
things that you have to deal with as a
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
solid waste facility that get in the way
 
01:59:41.679 --> 01:59:42.629 align:start position:0%
solid waste facility that get in the way
of

01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
being a manufacturer or certain things
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
that you have to deal with as a
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh would give you an advantage if you
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
weren't called solid waste
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's on the classification i can
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
certainly have craig address that more
 
01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.350 align:start position:0%
certainly have craig address that more
but

01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
if they're not a solid waste facility
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
why should they have to come in and be
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
permitted as a solid waste facility i
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
mean if they're making new products they
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to be classified
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
properly right i'm just trying to figure
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
out if if you know what is what the real
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
impediment is because they're still
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
subject to permitting and des coming in
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
and audits and everything else so
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're not looking to get out of
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything they're just looking to
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
make sure they're classified correctly
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay so that they would be subject to
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
the right sorts correct all regulations
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you all right so i'm going
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
to ask the committee if if you don't
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
questions that are really just general
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
if they're real technical can we please
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
hold them for the work group because
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to be here all afternoon
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise and and i think we're we don't
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
have the right person necessarily in
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
front of us as she stated to answer the
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
real technical questions so
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%

02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you i hope i don't think this is
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
technical yeah my understanding from a
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
study is that in 2018
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
we recycle 3 million tons of plastic but
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
we produce 35 million tons of plastic
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
can you give me any idea of what you
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
think the throughput would be
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
kind of an average throughput you would
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
see on an annual basis for this
 
02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.470 align:start position:0%
see on an annual basis for this
facility

02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
so if if i could ask where that study
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
what is the study that you're referring
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
to uh i
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know it was a webinar i intend
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't put down the thing it
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay just said that yeah and and it kind
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
of goes along with you're saying 90
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
percent correct we're saying the same
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
thing so you said 3
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
million tons compared to 30 million so
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
it would it's about 90 percent that are
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
not being recycled yeah correct yeah so
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
what would be the what would be the kind
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the expected or average throughput of
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
a facility in new hampshire what do you
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
think it would be we could definitely
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
drill that down for new hampshire but i
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
know new york if 25
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
of plastics were of those hard to
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
recycle were recycled annually
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
800 million ton 800 000 tons a year that
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be recycled new york that's new
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
york so we would have to do a comparable
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
um but certainly you're looking at tons
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
and tons and tons
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
and just one follow-up that i mean even
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
based on the examples i provide in the
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
other states and what what the sites are
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
currently doing right now i caught a few
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
of them but i okay so
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay and the the last thing and again it
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
was from this webinar and basically it
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
said that corporate sustainability goals
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
will pay more for recycled resins rather
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
than virgin resins
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
and so would the residents coming out of
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
these facilities be considered
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh recycled or
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
or not because of this solid waste
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
facilities management type of thing
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
without the webinar and understanding
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
the webinar that you're although i think
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
i have an idea but um the ver it would
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
be taking virgin resins as well
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
if that answers the question i mean it
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
would go into the representative kaplan
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i hope this is a pertinent question
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
it references a couple of things that
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh the first one was the
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
economic benefits to the state i'm
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
assuming you're talking about the jobs
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
so say there's one of these facilities
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
built in in new hampshire how many jobs
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
are we actually talking about so it
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
depends on the size uh so in some states
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
i know there's over a hundred jobs um
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
some have about
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're aware that there's like a five
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
percent or less unemployment rate right
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
now so it's it's a buyer's market for
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
jobs so i'm assuming you're talking
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
about good jobs like plant managers
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
chemical engineers those kind of how
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
many of those kind of jobs are we
 
02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.709 align:start position:0%
many of those kind of jobs are we
talking

02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
probably on the plant matter well you've
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
got you would have a plant manager but
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
on different you know chemical you need
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
to have chemical engineers but then
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
you've got construction jobs on top of
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
that right so you're talking good salary
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
paid jobs you're talking all different
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
how many jobs would you say i don't have
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
a specific announcement amount because
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
the company's not in new hampshire yet
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i can't i mean i can tell you what
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
we've done in other states
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and what we'd be looking at but until
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
they're set up i i don't have it exact
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
on how many jobs would be here
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
specifically i think i think we're going
 
02:03:56.639 --> 02:03:57.350 align:start position:0%
specifically i think i think we're going
to

02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
back off on this line just a little bit
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting really nitty-gritty and
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to save that for the work
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
session any other questions that are not
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
real technical like that
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i i appreciate you
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
coming in and taking giving us testimony
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the information you've provided
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for considering
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
the bill and for your time today
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay next we're going to call on john
 
02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:26.390 align:start position:0%
okay next we're going to call on john
tuthill

02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is john
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
tuthill i live in acworth sullivan
 
02:04:32.239 --> 02:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
tuthill i live in acworth sullivan
county

02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
i watched the uh
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
tape of the senate hearing this is a
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill actually we'd flagged when it was
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
still an lsr and we saw that it was
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with something called advanced
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
recycling that looked pretty positive
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
and innocuous
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh and unfortunately um we got sort of
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
tied up with some other solid waste
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
issues this year and uh
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
dropped off my radar
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh until it got to the senate or it flew
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
through and was not getting the sort of
 
02:05:04.639 --> 02:05:05.589 align:start position:0%
through and was not getting the sort of
good

02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
questions that this committee
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
has been posing today
 
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
has been posing today
um

02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
sullivan county we've already been
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
through this we saw
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
trade groups and an industry come into
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
our region
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
with a proposal for some
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
advanced technology to deal with
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
waste materials and resources
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature did provide subsidies
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i think there's the potential for
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
state subsidies in this case
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very very broad bill
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it's highly technical it's
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
surprising to me when the prime sponsor
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
arrives and suggests that he would like
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
to defer questions to
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
the organization which
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
asked him to bring this legislation
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
forward saying that they will be in a
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
better position to answer questions
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
particularly technical questions
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
clearly um this organization was not
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
prepared for today's hearings i would
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
like to strongly urge
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
that rather than going to a work session
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
based on what you've seen today
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and up
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
upon review of the senate
 
02:06:14.719 --> 02:06:15.669 align:start position:0%
upon review of the senate
audio

02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
audio
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh back in february 8th
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
that you consider
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
finding this itl right now we're not
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
ready for this new hampshire
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
does not have the regulatory framework
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
or the rules in place to deal with this
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
emerging industry
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
as i say it's very broad
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with all sorts of
 
02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with all sorts of
processes

02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
processes
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were cited earlier in
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony about the the volumes of
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
material being processed are minute
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
compared to the
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
the amounts of plastic that are now
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
moving through our consumer society
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
really this looks to me like more of
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh the now defunct american plastics
 
02:06:57.679 --> 02:06:59.109 align:start position:0%
uh the now defunct american plastics
council

02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
did for many years which is to put up
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
the appearance that the plastics
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
industry and the companies providing
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
their feedstocks
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
were effectively recycling when in fact
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out also in earlier
 
02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:12.550 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out also in earlier
testimony

02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of recycling going on with
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
plastic products is
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
is negligible
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of sorts of plastics
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you are controlling the resin quality
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned earlier this would be
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
far easier they're beginning to deal
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
with this in europe but you need to be
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulating the manufacturers and the
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
feedstocks carefully so that recycling
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
and reuse becomes possible our issue
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
here really is about
 
02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
here really is about
reduction

02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
in these materials and the legislature
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
has looked at bills dealing with things
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
like container deposit which would
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduce the amount of
 
02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.910 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduce the amount of
plastics

02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
plastics
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
moving towards the disposal streams
 
02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:49.270 align:start position:0%
moving towards the disposal streams
and

02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
would divert them into
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
effective reuse
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
single-use plastics have been discussed
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
by the legislature in recent years
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen much movement on that but
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
that's another way to start getting
 
02:08:01.599 --> 02:08:02.709 align:start position:0%
that's another way to start getting
reductions

02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where the focus ought
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
to be rather than thinking you can come
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
in with
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
these energy-intensive technologies
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with what are likely to be
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with waste it's
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
always looking for a place to go and
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's looking at what's the cheapest
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
place to go
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
and there's one implication of this
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation which suggests that
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
as soon as a truckload of material
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
drives through the gate that it is now
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
deemed to be a non-waste and no longer
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
prevents any sort of contamination issue
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important that des
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
continue to have complete regulatory
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
authority over these feedstocks so they
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
do not become used
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
as a place to make hard to manage
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
and contaminated materials uh disappear
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
even if it is disappearing into an
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
industrial process which will have some
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
pollution control but there are
 
02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
pollution control but there are
emissions

02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh you also have a solid waste
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
coming out the back end not slag
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily sometimes referred to as
 
02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:05.350 align:start position:0%
necessarily sometimes referred to as
char

02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
char
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
but a lot of plastics have stabilizers
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
and colorants in them
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to be finding pfas in these
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
these streams whatever you want to call
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
it whether you want to call it waste or
 
02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:15.430 align:start position:0%
it whether you want to call it waste or
not

02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
heavy metals are in plastic for
 
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.149 align:start position:0%
heavy metals are in plastic for
stabilizers

02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
metals also for colorants which is what
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
makes detergent bottles jump off the
 
02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
makes detergent bottles jump off the
shelf

02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
shelf
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know this stuff is not innocuous and
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
we need to be regulating it
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
intelligently and carefully
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
i really i strongly urge you to say this
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
this is too complex this is far too
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
broad it's going to require at least
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
another year if the state truly wants to
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
open its door to this emerging industry
 
02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
open its door to this emerging industry
there

02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
have already been efforts in new
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire to crack the door open i think
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
the senator who proposed legislation in
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
2016 said well we want to start small
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
and they did and we now have some
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
regulations in rsa 125c air regulations
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
which would be over inside tech but
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
they did pass legislation um supporting
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis which is one of the
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
technologies discussed in this bill
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
des went ahead and adopted rules
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the feedstock which is exactly what
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
needs to happen here des does have to be
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
involved up front making sure that these
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
feedstocks are not contaminated or not
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
increasing risk to public health in the
 
02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.669 align:start position:0%
increasing risk to public health in the
environment

02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the rules des did adopt
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
for pyrolysis and the vendor that was
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
interested in this never did show up in
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
the state it was a canadian company and
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it was clearly a bill designed to
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
encourage that investment it hasn't
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
happened but the the standards that were
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
set in the rules were
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
were just extraordinary in that the
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
levels of lead for example or been
 
02:10:49.599 --> 02:10:50.950 align:start position:0%
levels of lead for example or been
permitted

02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
this wasn't plastics in this case this
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
was construction and demolition debris
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
they were going to allow 10 by weight of
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
what are called fines which is the
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
particles that fall out of a processing
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
facility for construction and demolition
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
debris in this case they're looking to
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
make fuel
 
02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:07.270 align:start position:0%
make fuel
um

02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
you need to be
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
getting up as close to the source of
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
the production
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
of hazardous materials as you can and
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
start regulating it there and not simply
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
create a doorway through which you can
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
pass material and then say well it's no
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
longer of concern
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
from an environmental or a public health
 
02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
from an environmental or a public health
perspective

02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
i really
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
urge you as
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who testified earlier did that
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
you do take the time to look at that
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
senate hearing from february 8th just
 
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:43.830 align:start position:0%
senate hearing from february 8th just
astonishing

02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
astonishing
 
02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:44.870 align:start position:0%
astonishing
um

02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
the lack of
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
sort of thought and
 
02:11:50.550 --> 02:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
even interest or the lack of questions
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
that were asked um
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
i really felt the lobbyists
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
who had come in for the organization
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
promoting this this bill
 
02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:02.550 align:start position:0%
promoting this this bill
um

02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
i mean he just
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
he must not have been able to believe
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
his eyes
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
the reception he was getting and yet the
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
um the sponsors or at least those that
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
were on the committee that was hearing
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
the bill did not seem to have a firm
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
grasp of what was in the bill
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
um and even the representative
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the the organization today i think
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
really did not
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh provide this committee with enough
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
information to even go forward
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
um i'll leave it at that there's a lot
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
to say on this but i really urge you
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
um to be very careful before you open
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
this door as i say in sullivan county we
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
did see
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature invite an industry into
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
back in the 80s and i keep coming before
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
this committee and others because we in
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
sullivan county paid a very very high
 
02:12:53.119 --> 02:12:54.390 align:start position:0%
sullivan county paid a very very high
price

02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
for decisions that were made here to
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
promote private investment in
 
02:12:58.159 --> 02:12:59.669 align:start position:0%
promote private investment in
technologies

02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
where in fact
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
the real effort i believe in managing
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
waste is has got to be around
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
education behavior
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
and frankly beginning to limit
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
some of the materials that are routinely
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
used in consumer products thank you
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr tuthill any questions
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none we appreciate you coming in
 
02:13:21.599 --> 02:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
seeing none we appreciate you coming in
today

02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
next we will call up uh heidi tremero
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
from clf sorry if i didn't get the last
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
name right heidi tremarco
 
02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:32.629 align:start position:0%
name right heidi tremarco
okay

02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
hello so i um i'm sending around the
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
written remarks but i believe they were
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
also emailed to the committee
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
on april 1st from my colleague peter
 
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:58.149 align:start position:0%
on april 1st from my colleague peter
blair

02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
blair
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
clf is here to oppose this bill which is
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
really you know the name advanced
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
recycling should really be seen for what
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is which is a greenwashing
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
description of this bill you've heard
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
today it described as a high heat
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
thermal process it is a burning of
 
02:14:14.239 --> 02:14:15.430 align:start position:0%
thermal process it is a burning of
plastics

02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
plastics
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
and it is not recycling in fact you've
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
been told it's not recycling they want
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
it to be called manufacturing
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
so this is not an advanced recycling
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill despite the name
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
clf supports recycling and you've heard
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
today there's many things we need to do
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of plastics that
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
are going into our landfills and there
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
are solutions out there we'd love for
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
those the committee to consider those
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know there's uh composting extended
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
um source reduction there's a bottle
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
bill there's a lot of things that can be
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
done that we know work
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
this is not one of them this is there's
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of unknown um with this bill as
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
you as you've heard today and
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why this technology
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
should be deregulated by the state
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to hear any reason
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
really articulated why
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
this process can't go forward under the
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
current regulations and why the american
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
chemistry council is pushing for
 
02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.390 align:start position:0%
chemistry council is pushing for
deregulation

02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
deregulation
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
of this plastics
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
and we should be really wary of that
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is a dangerous process with a lot
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
of environmental externalities and we
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
have these documented in our comments
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
but you know just to call out part of
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
them like traditional waste incineration
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
this process creates a significant
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
environmental harm they emit just as
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
much carbon dioxide as waste
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
incinerators and they admit air
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
emissions that contain heavy metals like
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
lead and mercury as well as other toxics
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
they can include pcbs
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
hydrogen cyanide carbon monoxide
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
nitrogen sulfur dioxides this is not a
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
there it is not a clean process there's
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of environmental externalities
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
as you've heard today northern new
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
england states are doing this and
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
specifically similar bills to deregulate
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
this burning of plastic under the guise
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
of advanced recycling has been brought
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
forward and rejected in connecticut
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
rhode island and massachusetts so the
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
other new england states are saying we
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't want this dirty process in our
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
state and what will happen if new
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire does this deregulation is you
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
can you will see
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
these wastes being sent to new hampshire
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
we already import 50 percent of our
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
waste that goes into our landfills from
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
out of state new hampshire does not want
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
to keep attracting the other the waste
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.599 --> 02:16:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.230 align:start position:0%
and
finally

02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
as we look at this new or emerging
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
technology and we look at all these
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
questions that came up today that we
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
keep saying you know are really
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
technical questions that need to be
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
considered further new hampshire has a
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group that is
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
these issues and can specifically
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
address this bill came up at the last
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
meeting of new hampshire solid waste
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
working group and we know that the state
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services is
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
updating the state solid waste plan
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
currently we're operating under a plan
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the state produced in 2003 and des
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
was supposed to update that plan every
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
six years and they haven't done so now
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
they tell us that they are
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
we are on the cusp of a new plan that a
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
new plan is coming out in october um
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
director wimsat testified to that in uh
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
previous hearings in the past couple
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
weeks so des says that we're going to
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
have a new state solid waste plan in
 
02:17:27.599 --> 02:17:28.469 align:start position:0%
have a new state solid waste plan in
october

02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
october
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so i respectfully say that while we
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
await that new plan it is inexpedient to
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
move forward on this bill and to
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
deregulate this burning of plastics and
 
02:17:38.479 --> 02:17:39.349 align:start position:0%
deregulate this burning of plastics and
so

02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
we suggest that the committee move the
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill is inexpedient to legislate
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
i can take any questions
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah so you re you
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
reference extended producer
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility as one alternative for
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with plastics so if
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
if if an industry
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
takes back their single use plastics
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
after they're being used what do they do
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
well there's a myriad of things the
 
02:18:15.519 --> 02:18:16.629 align:start position:0%
well there's a myriad of things the
industry

02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
could do with them i'm not sure i
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
understand okay so i guess
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
they're going the if the if the industry
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
takes back their single-use plastics
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to have some
 
02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:27.190 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to have some
mechanism

02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
for breaking those down into something
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
that is once again usable
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if
 
02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:34.870 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if
this

02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:35.990 align:start position:0%
this
if

02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis which does in fact not use
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
oxygen and therefore does not create
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
if pyrolysis is not is taken off the
 
02:18:46.319 --> 02:18:47.349 align:start position:0%
if pyrolysis is not is taken off the
table

02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
then how are they going to convert those
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
single-use plastics which are generally
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
in the category of difficult to deal
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
with plastics how are they going to
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
manage to
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
turn those into something useful well
 
02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:01.030 align:start position:0%
turn those into something useful well
certainly

02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing if this bill fails to go
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
forward that doesn't need pyrolysis is
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
taken off the table for all what this
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
does is it deregulates these plastic
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
feed stock as solid waste so it doesn't
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
those that technology can't be explored
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
further and i think it should be
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
explored further by the working group
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
and by des and the experts should weigh
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
in on the viability of that process
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
follow it so
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
if this process is
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
largely an industrial manufacturing
 
02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:35.190 align:start position:0%
largely an industrial manufacturing
process

02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
would it make more sense to have it
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
regulated under
 
02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.230 align:start position:0%
regulated under
the

02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
regulations that cover manufacturers
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:51.830 align:start position:0%
i don't think
um

02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the question is would it make more
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
sense to regulate as manufacturing yeah
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
i mean currently this the this is waste
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
that goes into the feedstock
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't think i'm following
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
the the material that that is going into
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
these plants
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh could either be classified as solid
 
02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:13.190 align:start position:0%
uh could either be classified as solid
waste

02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
waste
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
and would have one set of regulations
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
applied to it such as keeping rats out
 
02:20:18.399 --> 02:20:19.670 align:start position:0%
applied to it such as keeping rats out
or

02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
it would could be treated as a
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
raw material raw material for a
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process and that
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process would have
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that deal with things like
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
clean air both at the federal and state
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
level uh clean water st
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
state and federal level uh and the
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
disposal of
 
02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:42.389 align:start position:0%
disposal of
uh

02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
of what would be the char or slag or
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
whatever that is that that
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
20 that was referenced as not being
 
02:20:50.319 --> 02:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
20 that was referenced as not being
reusable

02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
reusable
 
02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:52.790 align:start position:0%
reusable
so

02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
would it make more sense to regulate
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
this uh under manufacturing rules rather
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
than solid waste rules
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm hesitant to say to regulate this
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
because i don't think the bill is clear
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
what falls into which category and when
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
as you asked earlier when it when the
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
waste transitions from being waste to
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
this feedstock and so
 
02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
this feedstock and so
uh

02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think this is just another unknown you
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
know we have current regulations in
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
place and there's no reason to to wave
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
them and deregulate but i can um try to
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
i can take that question back as well
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
and just provide more information you
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
know i can try to see if i can get a
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
more detailed answer but right now i
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
think it's too undefined okay follow-up
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
sure one more so um in the pro point uh
 
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think that one thing that i'd like to
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
have answered in that follow-up is what
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
do not yet exist for the manufacturing
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
processes involved in pyrolysis
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
and advanced recycling
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
that would need to be in place in order
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
what sorts of regulations do not yet
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
exist in regards to pyrolysis
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
that need to be in place in order to
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
make it safe okay i will take that
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
question back thank you good response to
 
02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.630 align:start position:0%
question back thank you good response to
you

02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:22:14.319 --> 02:22:15.910 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
kennedy

02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
kennedy
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question des has
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
stated that they are comfortable with
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
this language
 
02:22:21.439 --> 02:22:24.550 align:start position:0%
this language
why

02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
i want to say why do you disagree with
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are comfortable with
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
the language if they have worked with
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
the senate on it
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
and this is now what we have in front of
 
02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:38.550 align:start position:0%
and this is now what we have in front of
us

02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't test i can't explain why
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
des says they're comfortable uh
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
deregulating this waste but it raises a
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
red flag to me that des is willing to
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
waive that authority and to and to
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
weaken as you said as you heard before
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
the language has been weakened as it
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
went through the senate and i think that
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
is really concerning um and
 
02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
is really concerning um and
des

02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:08.469 align:start position:0%
 
they

02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't they weren't able to provide
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
any reason why the waste should be
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
deregulated and why this process should
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
be deregulated and so i don't it's hard
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
to explain why they're taking that
 
02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:21.830 align:start position:0%
to explain why they're taking that
position

02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
so so i'm not going to speak for des
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
specifically but as you are aware i am
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
the representative for the house and the
 
02:23:29.429 --> 02:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group and this bill
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
did come up and
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
what uh director wim said
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
certainly conveyed to the working group
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
was that they were comfortable that
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
the wording within the bill gave them
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
the power to
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
or the authority excuse me to go in and
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
inspect these facilities and one of
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
their major concerns was in the event
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
that a facility failed and there were
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
still some of this solid waste that had
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
not been processed on site would they
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go in and manage and
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
regulate the
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate dispersal of things that
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
were still might be considered solid
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
waste within that facility so that that
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
was one of the things that director wims
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
had touched on directly
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead if you want to and i just
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think des needs to do the planning
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
work first and they're engaged in that
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
planning and we're told it's coming
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
right now so
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's this is putting the cart before
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
the horse you know this is like issuing
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
landfill permits relying on an outdated
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan we need to do the
 
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
planning first and decide what direction
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
the state wants to go
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
before we start deregulating certain
 
02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:33.190 align:start position:0%
before we start deregulating certain
procedures

02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you we
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%

hopefully i got it right i didn't have
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
listening to me today i'm nancy morrison
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
from mont vernon new hampshire
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief because mostly the
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
things i would like to say have been
 
02:25:08.479 --> 02:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
things i would like to say have been
said

02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not as eloquent as speaker as
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
some of the ones you've heard today
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
but i am here to
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
give an opinion as a citizen
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire and the world needs
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
less plastic
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
not creating more from old plastic
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
that is highly energy intensive to
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
create actually 87 times
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
higher than the energy it would give if
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
it was made into fuel
 
02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:39.670 align:start position:0%
it was made into fuel
and

02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
creates often inferior products
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
and adds pollution to our world in the
 
02:25:49.030 --> 02:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
form of dioxins pfas and metals
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
i would encourage all of you to take
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
this very very slowly as has been
 
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:56.550 align:start position:0%
this very very slowly as has been
mentioned

02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:58.150 align:start position:0%
mentioned
this

02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
industry is relatively new
 
02:26:00.479 --> 02:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
industry is relatively new
and

02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
states have adopted it but they've
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
struggled with it and from what i have
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
read and researched there has been
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
moderate success at best
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
i encourage all of you to
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
google a report by
 
02:26:15.359 --> 02:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
google a report by
reuters

02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
reuters
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
in november of last year 2021
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i think it will help you to balance
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
some of the things you heard from the
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
acc in order to get
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
two sides to the coin it's an excellent
 
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
two sides to the coin it's an excellent
article

02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
but basically i believe we are swapping
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
pollution from the ground to the air and
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
the trading one evil for another is
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
where this would be at right now i feel
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
like it's just too early to take this on
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
and more research needs to be done and a
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
study group is a great idea for you
 
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.150 align:start position:0%
study group is a great idea for you
folks

02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
but plastic reduction is the answer
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
and with respect to rev representative
 
02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
and with respect to rev representative
avard

02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
avard
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling is a plan but it's
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's a bad plan right now for new
 
02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
it's a bad plan right now for new
hampshire

02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
with that i thank you for listening to
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
me will you take questions oh
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
and are there any questions from the
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none i guess
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%

02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%

02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in welcome to the
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair members of the
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is kirsten koch and
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of public policy for
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
the business and industry association
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
also known as bia i'm here today to
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
express bia support for senate bill 367.
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill furthers environmental
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
sustainability and brings economic
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
benefits to new hampshire
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
we believe that this bill furthers the
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
state's solid waste management goals by
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
preventing many traditionally hard to
 
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
recycle plastics from going into new
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire landfills instead these
 
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling facilities can
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
manufacture these products
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
into a variety of reusable materials we
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
believe it's time to welcome these
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers with this technology into
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in order to divert solid
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
waste from landfills and begin
 
02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
developing a more robust recycling
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
market in new england
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 367 also encourages advanced
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities to come to new
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire for business ultimately
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
bringing more jobs to the local economy
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
on a variety of levels
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
this bill provides regulatory certainty
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
for advanced recycling facilities the
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
main function of these facilities is to
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
manufacture new materials not to manage
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
the disposal of waste new hampshire
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
should welcome sustainable business and
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
we believe that these facilities should
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
be regulated as what they are which is
 
02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.950 align:start position:0%
be regulated as what they are which is
manufacturers

02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request this committee
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
to pass senate bill 367 because
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
it would further environmental
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
sustainability and
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
increase economic opportunities for the
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%

a dream it sounds like the absolute
solution

people you are on either side of the
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
aisle here we learned that from you in
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
terms of other things and the work we've
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
done with you
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%

if this can be done
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
improve it and let's go for it we'll all
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
benefit but for heaven's sakes don't
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
make a mistake that's going to put more
 
02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
stuff in the air that's going to have to
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
be dealt with one way or another and we
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
will not benefit from it so as i said i
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
