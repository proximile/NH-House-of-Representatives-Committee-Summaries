00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
we have four bills
 
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 align:start position:0%

my intention is if at all possible to
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
execute those bills today so we don't
 
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 align:start position:0%

to do that
 
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 align:start position:0%

just a heads up
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
but that also means that if you make the
 
00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
motion you have to write the committee
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where we are as a

and 36 million to
 
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
municipal bridge aid which would be

non-lapsing money and that's all coming
 
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
out of um
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the other one is
 
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
and the other one is
um

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
1221 is being amended by the senate and
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is the so-called
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
gas tax holiday
 
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
it will probably
 
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
for concurrence or
 
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
or request a committee a conference
 
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
i bring that up because both of those
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
deal with the highway fund of which we
 
00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
deal with the highway fund of which we
are

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh the guardians in large part so

uh
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
not in that position for all that long
 
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.150 align:start position:0%
not in that position for all that long
but

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
he was very well regarded and well
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
regarded in his community which was the
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
community of romney where he lived
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.150 align:start position:0%
and so
appropriately

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
with senator gaiada we have asked that a
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
bridge and this is a bridge on main
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
street in rumney uh on a state road
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
which crosses the baker river be named
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
sign be placed there
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill and we would ask
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
you to consider that i can't speak to
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
the second half of the bill i don't know
 
00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
the second half of the bill i don't know
about

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%

questions i do

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%

is this the buffalo road bridge
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
this is the main street no this is the
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
main street bridge as i understand it
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
and the main street is you go from route
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
25 and you go into
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
rumney right on the roadway that
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
eventually goes up to stinson lake but
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
you cross over the baker river there's a
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
bridge there that crosses over the river
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.509 align:start position:0%
representative
abbott

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i just
 
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.029 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i just
wondered

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
wondered
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
if the town of romney
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
has approved
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
i do not know whether the town of romney
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
has approved
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
the naming uh i
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
can't tell you whether
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
senator guy to ask i don't know for sure
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
the reason being that when we do any of
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
these naming bills is there a question
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
here or a statement would you believe
 
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.750 align:start position:0%
here or a statement would you believe
that

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
we usually get the the municipality to
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
prove that
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
i i think that makes good sense but um i
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
can tell you that i don't believe that
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
the town of romney certainly would have
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions from members of
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%

he's here to answer any questions
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
anybody might have about
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
naming these
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
two bridges anybody have questions of
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
yep if if you would come forward
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for listening to
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
the testimony i don't have much
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
testimony i can tell you that
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
i worked with the previous legislative
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
aide for representative guida griffin
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
roberts when he was putting this bill
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
together initially they wanted to name
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
route 25
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
that highway is already named the moosa
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
lock highway
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
so they worked
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
with the community so they did reach out
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the town of romney
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
to see if they'd have any issues with
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
the i wasn't part of that discussion but
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that when they
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
realized that route 25 was already named
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
they looked at the main street bridge as
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
a secondary location in the town of
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
romney and they did work with the town
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
to get their endorsement i don't think
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's in writing but they did reach out
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%

sponsors are here i can't answer that
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
question and it did not come up looking
 
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.590 align:start position:0%
question and it did not come up looking
through

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
what was
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
the committee report from
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
that question was never asked there
 
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
that question was never asked there
either

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner i just want to
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
say i think the lack of
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
letters from the town is something that
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
would certainly concern us more if this
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
were originating
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
in this committee i want to
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
i think we can offer
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
some credibility to our senate
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues for having reviewed this
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
before and i'm willing to
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
to accept
that

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
i i tend to agree with that coming from
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
a second committee the town is towns
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
have had an opportunity to weigh in
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
through their representatives if nothing
 
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.150 align:start position:0%
through their representatives if nothing
else

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
else

port director of the new hampshire port
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
authority in the 2019 budget package a
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
sum of money was assigned to a port
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
authority project in rye harbor
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
those funds were refunded by the
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
contractor and sb 278 will allow those
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
funds to be made available to the

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
the piscataqua river turning basin has
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
been an issue for years with the size of
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
the turning basin no longer being
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient for modern vessels
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
widening the turning basin with these
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
additional funds will be a massive boon
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the seacoast economically
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
making the area more efficient and much
 
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
making the area more efficient and much
safer

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
safer
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
in the 2021 budget package 1.5 million
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
dollars was appropriated to the turning
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
basin project
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
sb 278 is taking the remaining
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand fifty one dollars
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%

one hundred and forty three dollars from
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
the 2019 rye harbor project and adding
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
to the total for the turning basin

00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
although the language of the bill is not
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
clear in this respect at first glance
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is not drawing new funds
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
instead it's reallocating funds from the
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
2019 budget cycle that were reabsorbed
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
by the general fund because no
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing language was used at the
 
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.310 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing language was used at the
time

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
the senate finance committee amended to
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
sb 278 to be more correct in its form
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
and make it more in line with other
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
appropriations bills
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%

this has been a long time project the
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
widening of the turning basin was a
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
project that was identified in a
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
navigation safety improvement study that
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
was published by the army corps of

2002
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that's how long i've been working on
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
the project
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
this this was one of five projects in
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%

the harbor
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
but in the big picture this is the last
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
choke point in the northeast shipping
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
corridor you'll remember a number of
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
years ago they replaced the south
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
portland bridge
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
most recently they replaced the chelsea
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
creek bridge going into logan airport
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's been some some dredging projects
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
one of the other ones that they
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
identified in the study was
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
the sarah mildred long bridge and the
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
navigation hazards that that caused
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
the bridge has been replaced and this is
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
the last of the choke points
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the corridor
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
why this is so important is when the
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
turning basin was constructed
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
in 1977
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
it was an 800-foot turning basin because
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
that was the size of the ships that were
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
frequenting the harbor they were you
 
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.829 align:start position:0%
frequenting the harbor they were you
know

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
550-foot ships today our pilots are
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
turning 765 foot ships in a 800 foot
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
turning basin
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
this project expands the turning basin
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
to 1200 feet and actually elongates it a
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
little bit so as the ship comes off the
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
dock and gets a little set
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
it gives them a little more room to
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
swing the bow around without grounding
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
we've got exceptional pilots
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
but because of the limitations of the
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
turning basin
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
there are limitations on the movement of
 
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.990 align:start position:0%
there are limitations on the movement of
cargo

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
cargo
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
daylight only
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
high tide only if there are wind
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
conditions or visibility conditions
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
they don't move the ship and every day
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
that the ship either waits outside to
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
come in or sits at the dock to leave
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
you know demerge rates on a ship that
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
are sitting idle can be
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
85 to 90 thousand dollars a day
 
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.589 align:start position:0%
85 to 90 thousand dollars a day
and

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
those fees are passed under the
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
consumers because a lot of the product
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's brought in
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
is home heating oil kerosene diesel fuel
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
and propane
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
so as we speak
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh monday morning
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
the project the project
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
got underway this season
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
the dredge season is uh
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
november uh to the first of april the
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
project permit did get an extra 15 days
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
but at the monday morning briefing the
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
corps of engineers and the contractors
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
indicated that there was about 42 000
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
cubic yards remaining
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
the project called for the removal of
 
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
the project called for the removal of
762

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
762
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
000 cubic yards of dredge material
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
um of that 42 000 20 of that is
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh over dredge
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
so that really is only about 22 000 guys
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
that need to be removed and so the
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
scours that remove the the dredge
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
material to go offshore
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
they're 5 000 yard scouts so
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
they're indicating that
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably by friday they'll be finished
 
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
probably by friday they'll be finished
digging

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
digging
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
the corps will go in monday and do their
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
final survey of it if there's any
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
cleanup that needs to be done of any
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
high spots they've got a week to do that
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
i won't be back here again
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
turning basins
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
um so if i may mr chairman so what what
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
happened with this was is when when they
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
went out to bid
 
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.069 align:start position:0%
went out to bid
um

00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
obviously construction costs have gone
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
up so the bid came in
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
higher than what was anticipated
 
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
higher than what was anticipated
and

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
so we had gotten this refund from the
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
when we completed rye and we paid the
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
army corps of engineers up front all of
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
the money that they asked for
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
we thought the project had been closed
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
out so when it came around to ask for
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions we didn't think we
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
needed one
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
well what happened when they finally did
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
the final
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
accounting for the rye harbor project
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
there was less material removed by the
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
contractor than was anticipated and the
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
contract is based on a per cubic yard
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
cost so that's why we got this money
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
back from the core
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
but we needed it because of the cost
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh questions of mr marconi
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman through you to uh
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
mr marconi
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
where is the turning basin located i i
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
actually don't know where it is okay
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
i apologize i probably should have
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
brought a graphic with me uh the
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
piscataqua the the deepwater channel
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
starts at the entrance of the portsmouth
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
harbor and piscataqua river down
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
off of newcastle
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the deep water channel ends
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
just before you make that turn to go
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
dover point bridge
 
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
dover point bridge
so

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
when you look over there the last
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
terminal which is sprague you see these
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
two concrete
 
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.150 align:start position:0%
two concrete
silos

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
silos
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the end of the deep
 
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.589 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the end of the deep
water

00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
and so it's on opposite side of the
 
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.190 align:start position:0%
and so it's on opposite side of the
channel

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
channel
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
once the dredging is done where does all
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
the dredge material go to
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's a great question one of the
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
advantages of having this project take
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
so long to really get off the feet is
 
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.710 align:start position:0%
so long to really get off the feet is
that

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the core has has over the last five or
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
six years came up with a program for the
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial use of dredge spoils
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
the word spoils kind of makes everybody
 
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
the word spoils kind of makes everybody
go

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
the geotechnical borings and surveys
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
that were done on this material is that
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
it was about 80 percent hard packed
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
glacial sand
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
base plan was to go to a epa approved
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
dump site outside the isles of shoals
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
however in the last few years with the
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial use program
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
about 150 or 60 000 cubic yards went
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
down to salisbury beach and a similar
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
amount of the dredge material went down
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
to plum island and we all know the last
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
few years the
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
winter storms have decimated those
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
beaches so it's a beneficial use so it
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
went down the air it was it was dumped
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know a few hundred yards off the
 
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
you know a few hundred yards off the
beach

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
beach
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the engineers and the scientists say
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
that the wave action will push it back
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
up and hopefully
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
restore some of the beach fronts
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
i have a couple um
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the budget and lapses
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and everything
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
under this scenario we're talking about
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
the capital budget from 2019 for rye
 
00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
the capital budget from 2019 for rye
harbor

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
harbor
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
that came in under and you got a refund
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
did we borrow all of that money i think
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
it was 600 and
 
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.190 align:start position:0%
it was 600 and
um

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
37 000
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
or or something like that did we
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually go out and bond that entire
 
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.750 align:start position:0%
actually go out and bond that entire
amount

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
at that time before the
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i don't ask i don't know
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question i'd have to
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
ask um i asked to have steve mclaughlin
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
over at admin services he's our business
 
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.829 align:start position:0%
over at admin services he's our business
agent

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
agent
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.470 align:start position:0%
okay but
the

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars that was
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
refunded from that
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
is enough to make up the difference
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
on the turning basin
 
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.670 align:start position:0%
on the turning basin
you

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
you just said you weren't going to be
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.589 align:start position:0%
coming back
correct

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:47.670 align:start position:0%
correct
correct

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the there's some
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
more money that that's due
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
some of it is coming out of the hybrid
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
dredge p maintenance fund
 
00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:58.470 align:start position:0%
dredge p maintenance fund
um

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
where did the other money come from
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
there was just this money have a drudge
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
p maintenance fund
 
00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:14.790 align:start position:0%
p maintenance fund
and

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to make sure that you
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
have enough to complete this since we
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
only have a week and a half or so to get
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
it done
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman this is suzy
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
anzaloni she's our finance director over
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
at pease and she's our new finance
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
director so i'm putting her into the
 
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
director so i'm putting her into the
hutsey

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
hutsey
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
she came up today
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
understand how we do things um
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
i believe this is all covered yes
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
and if it's not what what do we do after
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be some time before the
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
corps of engineers closes out the
 
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.230 align:start position:0%
corps of engineers closes out the
project

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.349 align:start position:0%
project
so

00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
there is still funds that are part of
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
the appropriation the original
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation back in 2014 and 2016
 
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
appropriation back in 2014 and 2016
that

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
one was for construction and one was for
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
the post
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance contribution
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
that the corps requires
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
so there is still some other monies but
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
we don't want to touch the o m money
 
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.349 align:start position:0%
we don't want to touch the o m money
because

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to do a calculation on
 
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.430 align:start position:0%
they're going to do a calculation on
that

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
any

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative tom
 
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
representative tom
um

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
is there any chance that you're going to
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh um

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the amount of cubic yards on this
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
project like you did on
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
on rye harbor when they do the audit
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's possible because the discussions we
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
had on monday morning were as i said
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
there there was 42 000 cubic yards that
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
included um 20 000 that were over
 
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.470 align:start position:0%
included um 20 000 that were over
dredged

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
dredged
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
the project calls to go to 37 feet the
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
over dredge goes to 39 they're only
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
required under the contract to go to the
 
00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:15.349 align:start position:0%
required under the contract to go to the
37

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
37
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
but the contract if they dig more than
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
37 feet they get paid for it
 
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
37 feet they get paid for it
so

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
if they dig
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
37.2 feet that's what they get paid for
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and the rest of the money for the
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
overdredge won't get paid to him and
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
that was in that was in the payment that
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
we made to the corps of engineers so
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the adage will come up short and
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
we'll get a refund
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
and i'll be returning it back to the
 
00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:44.790 align:start position:0%
and i'll be returning it back to the
state

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you any
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
the the information that you gave
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative peterson on the dredging
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
material and where it goes i'm just
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
wondering is that donated or sold or
 
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.109 align:start position:0%
wondering is that donated or sold or
what

00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
what
if

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
the base plan is to go from the
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
construction site to the offshore
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
disposal site
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
if the transportation to an alternate
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
beneficially used site is greater or
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
costs more than it would be to go to the
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
base plan than the recipient
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
being the state of massachusetts would
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to pay the difference it's not it
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost us any more
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's paid by the recipient if it if it's
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
i i would just
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this and the house
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
agrees with us
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%

uh good morning for the record i'm
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
senator rebecca perkins quoca
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
representing district 21 city of
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and the towns of madbury lee
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
durham newington new market and
 
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.309 align:start position:0%
durham newington new market and
newfields

01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
newfields
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'm the prime sponsor of sb 378
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
and act relative to the disposal of
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
highway or turnbike-funded real estate
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
this request arose because
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
there's a parcel in newington that
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
some citizens would like to preserve
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
through the newington historical society
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
um it brought
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
up the fact that
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire d.o.t only has the
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
authority and power to dispose of funds
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
of property to municipalities and in
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
this particular case
 
01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:19.829 align:start position:0%
this particular case
there's

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
no interest on the part of the town of
 
01:03:21.359 --> 01:03:22.470 align:start position:0%
no interest on the part of the town of
newington

01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
newington
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
to take ownership of that parcel however
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know it remains in the public
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
interest to have it preserved and so
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
we worked with senator waters and i
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
worked with the department of
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
transportation to come up with language
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
which would allow
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire d.o.t to transfer certain
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
properties at less than market value to
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
a third party
 
01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.789 align:start position:0%
a third party
um

01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
in order to help provide latitude to new
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire d.o.t to facilitate this kind
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
of transfer um and other
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
sites for preservation and stewardship
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially others where there's
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
environmental benefit
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
the transfer of property in this case is
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
carefully worded
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
for a reason we wanted to
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
an organization that were to take over
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
property for less than fair market value
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
from the state would be obligated to
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
maintain its historical or preservation
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
character going forward
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
so language requiring covenants to be in
 
01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:22.549 align:start position:0%
so language requiring covenants to be in
the

01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%

i know that
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire dot is also here to
 
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.109 align:start position:0%

testify
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
and talk about how we came up with the
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
language but it was in fact from the
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
agency um the language that's in the
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
01:04:40.559 --> 01:04:41.349 align:start position:0%
bill so
uh

01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%

01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
i will leave it at that i i hope it's a
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward matter but i'm
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer any questions
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh questions
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh good morning
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
senator thank you for
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill um
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:04.950 align:start position:0%
there's a
in

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
section two roman numeral two it says if
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
the town city or county decides to
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
resell the property
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
do i assume that means that these
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
properties can only be sold at a lesser
 
01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.829 align:start position:0%
properties can only be sold at a lesser
value

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
to a town city or the county and not to
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
a private
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
preservation group that's right as the
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
statute stands now it can only be
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
transferred to a political subdivision
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the purpose of the
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
statute is to
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
allow the agency more latitude to
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
transfer to a private third party okay
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr
 
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.710 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr
chairman

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative boyd
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
senator cuoco thank you very much i
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate it what's
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
should this should all this come to
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
fruition and the governor signing into
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
law what's the what's the vision for the
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
property that the the community has in
 
01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.670 align:start position:0%
property that the the community has in
mind

01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
in this particular
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
parcel in newington um is a historical
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
railroad depot so it's
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's a building that needs to be
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
restored it's the newington historical
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
society that
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
wants to take stewardship over it and
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
has been doing fundraising which is
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
challenging without the ability to
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
obtain the property directly so
 
01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:25.750 align:start position:0%
obtain the property directly so
um

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
they you know
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
essentially an attraction for the town
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
that they have it's it's near the water
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
and um the hope is that this group can
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
provide it with an endowment basically
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
to keep it going forward
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
senator um would you believe that i i
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
would i lived in newington for many
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
years and i was on the budget committee
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
there and the
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
the town of newington is
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
really skilled at preserving their
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
buildings and so forth
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
they have a a beautiful old church that
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
they restored and they've done a variety
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
of things so um i i would have high
 
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.069 align:start position:0%
of things so um i i would have high
confidence

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
in them being able to pull this off as
 
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.029 align:start position:0%
in them being able to pull this off as
well

01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one piece of
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
property but this would
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
lots of different pieces and and we'll
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
listen to the department later but
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
can you give me any kind of definition
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
on what overall public interest based on
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
social environmental or economic
 
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:46.410 align:start position:0%
benefits actually means
 
01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
benefits actually means
[Laughter]

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
again this language was
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
designed to give the agency
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
discretion i understand that it's a
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
broad definition um with the reminder
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
that all land disposal that happens at
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the state level obviously has a very
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
extensive process which i'm sure the
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
chairman is intimately familiar with um
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
so i think the purpose here is to make
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
sure that if we're going to transfer um
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
to a third party at less than fair
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
market value that we're doing it for
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
some sort of public benefit and so that
 
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.669 align:start position:0%
some sort of public benefit and so that
was

01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
the intent of this language i would be
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
open to discussing
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
different words if that would be
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
something the chairman was interested in
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
while the department does not take a
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:46.950 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
um

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
mr labonte from new hampshire d.o.t
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
um is here to
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit and to answer any
 
01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:58.070 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit and to answer any
questions

01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as you just
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned i'm steve labonte i'm the
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
administrator of the bureau of right of
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
way at the new hampshire department of
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
transportation uh we played a little bit
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
of a role in in
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
developing this language
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
and as you mentioned uh earlier
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is just more than newington as far
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
as we see so we end up with a lot of
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
mitigation sites as part of projects
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
that if we're you know if we're altering
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
a road or building a road that would
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
impact wetlands we'll be required to um
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
acquire other areas
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
as mitigation land
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that once we acquire
 
01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that once we acquire
it

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's held in you know
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
held in perpetuity
 
01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.829 align:start position:0%
held in perpetuity
but

01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
we're not exactly the best stewards of
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
it because we just don't have the
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
resources so for instance we there was
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
one up in conway that over last summer i
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
went up to visit i pulled into the
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
parking lot there's a
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
pile of tires there and it's not
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
uncommon to find old tvs and
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so the idea here
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
is if we can find a third party that we
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
convey the property to
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that property is burdened
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
with conservation easements or
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
historical restrictions so to to the
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
extent there's any value
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's minute
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and the idea is these these
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh third-party entities would be the
 
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.189 align:start position:0%
uh third-party entities would be the
stewards

01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
stewards
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the department
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative cloudy okay thank you mr
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
chairman mr labonte i assume this bill
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
in a way it's written if this we passed
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
this bill it would have to go through
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
the regular long-range capital planning
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
utilization committee process
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
your department
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
would have to submit it to us the the
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
long-range committee would have to
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
review it approve it and then it would
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to go to governor and council
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
any further representative faulkner
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if you're familiar the
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
west lebanon train station but it seems
 
01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.110 align:start position:0%
west lebanon train station but it seems
like

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
the story sounds familiar
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i wonder how this
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
kind of preservation might have happened
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
it might be happening now without this
 
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
it might be happening now without this
particular

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
legislation is it possible to
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
to sell these properties at all under
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
the current current law
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
um it it well
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's possible but again we're
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
our view of it
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
when we were assisting with the
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
languages we really had in mind these
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation properties which we were
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
required to obtain as part of a project
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
for a specific reason
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be a property that's
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
really what we would consider surplus
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
because we have to use it either to
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
mitigate historical
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
impacts or
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative jack uh thank you mr
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you mr labonte so
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
following up on the chairman's concern
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
about line five you would be in the
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
purview of the long-range committee to
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether they thought that the
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
societal environmental whatever benefit
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and they could disapprove the
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
transfer if they didn't feel it was
 
01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
transfer if they didn't feel it was
warranted

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
warranted
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
by that
 
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
by that
correct

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
not sure i want that
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and good morning mr
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
labonte um
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
so in the situation that you just
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
described this mitigation issue what
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
what category would you see that falling
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
just so i understand the question you're
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
so social environmental or economic
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay so for instance if under a social
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would i would
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
covenant might fall under a social
 
01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
covenant might fall under a social
benefit

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
just because it's preserving a
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
community's history
 
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.910 align:start position:0%
community's history
under

01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a wetlands mitigation
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
site i i would think
 
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
site i i would think
environmental

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
economic benefits that would be
 
01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.510 align:start position:0%
economic benefits that would be
where

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
we are conveying a piece of property
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
that may not be
 
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.189 align:start position:0%
that may not be
mitigation

01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
property but might be a piece of
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
property we're conveying to new
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing authority
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
for for housing
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
um it and i i don't know that that's
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
what we had in mind when we did this but
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
just talking here now i could see where
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay so what in your mitigation
 
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.350 align:start position:0%
okay so what in your mitigation
um

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.870 align:start position:0%
um
example

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would find an exception
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
um it would be in the overall public
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
interest for environmental reasons to
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
relay say a wetland and what's a
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
non-proprietary governmental use
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
a non-proprietary governmental use
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
that comes out of 23 cfr
 
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
that comes out of 23 cfr
7

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
7
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
you take no ownership of that yeah
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and and i'm guessing a a
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
non-proprietary governmental use would
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
be something um
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're not leasing it to a
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
private entity for
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions i do have
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative thompson followed by
 
01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:06.390 align:start position:0%
uh representative thompson followed by
representative

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh mr bona you stated that um
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
you pulled into this place and there
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
were tires and and i know exactly what
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
you mean
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
and there are many of them in the state
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
would there be some sort of an agreement
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
in this transfer of property
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
that they do maintain these properties
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
and keep them in
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
good order
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes not only is there a uh an agreement
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
there's there's strict covenants that
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
the property is is conveyed with there's
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
also a roberta clause that if those
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
covenants are ever brought
 
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.149 align:start position:0%
covenants are ever brought
ever

01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
breached or the property is used for
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
something other than its intended
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
purpose which would be mitigation
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
um that it automatically reverts back to
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
the state okay thank you very much thank
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for taking my uh
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
for letting me take and thank you for
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.350 align:start position:0%
taking my question
44-39-c

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
states upon determination that the
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
property is no longer needed by the
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
state the governor and council shall
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
first offer it to the government of the
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
town city or county
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
in which the property is located if the
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
town city or county refuses the offer
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
the governor and city council may sell
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
convey transfer or lease the real
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
property so what's stopping
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
the historical society or somebody from
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
buying the property now
 
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.470 align:start position:0%
buying the property now
without

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
amending it this stuff
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
4.39 c
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
if there's land that the
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
state wants to get rid of and the city
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't want it
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
can it just then go to sale
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
for to a historical society or somebody
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes quite often that that's what
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
happens is we'll get approached
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
um or like for instance we're going
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
through this this exercise up in conway
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
now that the conway bypass has been
 
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.830 align:start position:0%
now that the conway bypass has been
dissolved

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're going through and we're selling up
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
we've once we once we determined that
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
there is a um
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
once we determine that we have identify
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
a property that is surplus
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
and it goes to long range
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
we then go to the we we then approach
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
the municipality telling this is the
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
property we've identified
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
this is the the value we've we've
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
appraised it at
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
if you have any interest please notify
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
us within 30 days we also do that with
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire housing authority um
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
and the same so
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
based on my reading of the statute
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
the municipality has what in essence is
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
a right of first refusal
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
then under a different statute 204 d i
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
believe it is um it then goes to the new
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing authority to see if
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
they can use it and after that we'll go
 
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.709 align:start position:0%
they can use it and after that we'll go
to

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
will either market it or in many cases
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's we've been approached by in a
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
butter because it's a it's a oddly
 
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
butter because it's a it's a oddly
shaped

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
shaped
 
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.550 align:start position:0%
shaped
uh

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
inaccessible piece of property that's
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
only good to the abutter so that we
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't bother marketing it on putting
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
it on the market we just go directly to
 
01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
it on the market we just go directly to
them

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
but we still have to offer it under this
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
statute we still have to offer that
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
piece to the municipality
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
eventually down the line what if it is
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetically a piece of property that
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
nobody seems to want and somebody comes
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
in and makes an offer that is currently
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
way below
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
what is considered
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
the assessed value does the state can
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
the state then sell it to them or do
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
they have to hang on to it i don't think
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
chairman graham would let me get away
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
with that when i went to long range
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
if he if he would then i can tell you
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro won't so
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's those checks and balances
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we have long range first views it
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately the the ultimate
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
one more well i might have two more
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
about you know i'm just i'm i'm curious
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to wrap my arms around this
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy so does this does the
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
state have a bunch of land that it's
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
can't do anything with because they
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
can't get current market value for it
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
not so much that we can't get current
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
market value but i will would say
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the state from the various
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
projects there these odd slivers of land
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
that even in the butter doesn't want
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
because it's so small and oddly shaped
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to pay us any
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
money for it
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
did you have another
 
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
did you have another
um

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah is the gist of this
 
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.510 align:start position:0%
yeah is the gist of this
statue

01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
statue
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
so they're able to quickly
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
sell it for
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
fair market value is that what this is
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
all about in a nutshell
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell this is the
 
01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell this is the
shaped

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
shaped
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
first of all the department really
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have an interest in
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
selling properties at less than fair
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
market value because once we sell a
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
property it goes back to the fed
 
01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.229 align:start position:0%
property it goes back to the fed
but

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
it goes into
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
our pool of money that we can use for
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
future projects so it's really not in
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the department's interest it's really
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
these properties that
 
01:20:33.199 --> 01:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
these properties that
are

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
are
purchased

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
purchased
for

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
for mitigation sites
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we were required by a project
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
because of the impacts either due to
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
historical assets or to wetlands
 
01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
historical assets or to wetlands
to

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
purchase land and hold it in perpetuity
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.679 --> 01:21:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's answering your
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this property in
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
question in
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
new market do you know what the value is
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
of that property and what the offer is
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't have that information in in
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
front of me i don't know that we've
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
completed an appraisal at this time but
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
asked another question
 
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.950 align:start position:0%
asked another question
follow-up

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
this talk of the public benefit could
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
the public benefit be considered to be
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
getting the highest price for that
 
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
getting the highest price for that
property

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
and returning it back to the people that
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
paid for it put the money up originally
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
i could see where that argument could be
 
01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.790 align:start position:0%
i could see where that argument could be
made

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
um let's not get too hung up on one or
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
two examples of
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
what properties may or may not fall
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
under this this would be a generalized
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
policy from the state of new hampshire
 
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
policy from the state of new hampshire
that

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
groups could use
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
to come forward
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
with a proposal
 
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
with a proposal
to

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
acquire property from the state at less
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
than what we paid for it or less than
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
what it is worth
 
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
what it is worth
for

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.470 align:start position:0%
for
social

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
social
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
environmental economic benefits
 
01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.310 align:start position:0%
environmental economic benefits
or

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:30.990 align:start position:0%
or
for

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
non-proprietary governmental use
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we will be
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
debating in our executive session
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
not whether or not the
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
newington should be able to preserve a
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
building or if somebody
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
wants to preserve the general sullivan
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
bridge for example um
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
so um i i just cautioned the committee
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
on that that we can talk about those
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
issues in the executive session but
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
let's try to nail down
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
policy will be in this bill if it was to
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
and become law
 
01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.910 align:start position:0%
and become law
and

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
i do have one question
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
you briefly mentioned
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
that somewhere if we were to go forward
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
with this type of process
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
that within the transfer covenants
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
something that says if you don't live up
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
to this like you allow tires to be
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
dumped on the property we would get it
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
back for free or get it just
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
no so how a roberta clause works is it
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably not something like
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
tires it's more like okay we've granted
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
you this property it's burdened with
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
this conservation easement and all of a
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
sudden you've put condos up
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
it reverts back to the state
 
01:23:58.239 --> 01:24:00.310 align:start position:0%
it reverts back to the state
automatically

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
so we don't buy it it comes back to us
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
now something like we saw tires that
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
would probably be a letter to the
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know to the organization who's
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
accepted it notifying them that
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's a breach of the covenants
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
but the same bottom line is if that
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
organization has gone out of business um
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and nonprofits go away all the time um
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
what happens at that point
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
so if the organization goes out of
 
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.110 align:start position:0%
so if the organization goes out of
business

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
the property would
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
i guess the state could
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
at that point take some type of action
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
like a quiet title action to gain the
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
property back or find another
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
that is all of the pink cards i have on
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill 378
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who has not testified
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
on the bill that wishes to testify at
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
this time is there anybody who's
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
testified once who wishes to speak a
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
second time see none
 
01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
second time see none
the

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing on senate bill 378
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
is closed
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i will open
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
general discussion on the bill at this
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
point before we take a motion let's just
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to talk to me you
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think the terms seem too general
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know i'd like to see this committee
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
have better control over property that's
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
sold in any shape and manner okay
 
01:25:59.120 --> 01:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
sold in any shape and manner okay
there

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
there is a committee that um
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative clutier mentioned earlier
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
long-range planning and utilization
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
which does have to pass on
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
any property being sold not just from
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation but
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
from any
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
agency that whole state land but it is
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
small group made up of members of public
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
works finance from both
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
house and senate
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think the key here is the
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
makes this more specific is that each
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
individual sale is going to be covered
 
01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:39.189 align:start position:0%
individual sale is going to be covered
by

01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
the you know covenants in the deed and
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
that i've got faith in the state to be
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
write those covenants in a manner that
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
protects the state's interests so
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
i i'd be in favor of providing this
 
01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.270 align:start position:0%
i i'd be in favor of providing this
flexibility

01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
one of the uh
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
what seems like it could be problematic
 
01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.350 align:start position:0%
what seems like it could be problematic
was

01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
the question that you brought up
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
about what if a
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
non-profit or an organization granted
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
this land
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
goes out of business it seems as though
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
in your reversion clause
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
that might be added into that
 
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.950 align:start position:0%
that might be added into that
clause

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
going forward so that it would prevent
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
us from getting into
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
legal issues with trying to take the
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
land back or whatever
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't see why that
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
could be very easily added wouldn't need
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be in the bill but
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative ebal
 
01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:47.350 align:start position:0%
representative ebal
um

01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
i actually
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
i like the intent of this bill um
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why the state should
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
only be able to sell property that it
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
wants to sell to
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities i think that
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
really limits its opportunities and
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
i think if the state
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
is interested in selling land of the
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
type that mr labonte was describing they
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
fair market value can be a little bit of
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
a fuzzy
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
concept because it assumes that there's
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
always a buyer that wants to buy at fair
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
market value but there may be times that
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's really really is in the public
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
interest for
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
land to be sold and um like in the
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
situations they described and i think we
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
should build in that that latitude
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
for them so i'm supportive i'm not sure
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
about every single word in what's here
 
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.950 align:start position:0%
about every single word in what's here
the

01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
most of the the property that is
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
conveyed out of any agency does not go
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
to a municipality or county or even the
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority it does go to
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
a third party
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
only because most towns and cities don't
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to buy more property um they want
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
somebody to buy it so they can charge
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
them taxes
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
by and large um
 
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
by and large um
and

01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
usually they they have the first writer
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
refusal as mr lebronte said and that's
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
about it most of them don't don't do it
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
um but there is that
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm trying to remember if uh
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
the normal long-range action has a
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
reversionary clause the ones that uh
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
come before them now so this is sort of
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
a new thing that's
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
coming up where if the nonprofit doesn't
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
perform properly the state will get it
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
back is that
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the way i see it and
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a nebulous in my own mind a
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
whole nebulous comment that we probably
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
ought to drill down a bit more before we
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
put it into statute
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative clooney
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%

01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
this time i'd like to make a motion of
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
interim study and i would like to speak
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
to my motion
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative clutier moves that um
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 378 be found
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
um be placed in interim study is there a
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
second second
 
01:30:28.639 --> 01:30:29.510 align:start position:0%
second second
who

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
from representative jack
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
their further discussion on the motion
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
of interim study on this bill
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i'd like to speak um
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
i i think i like the intent i mean i
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
think the sponsors have good intent but
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think as i'm listening to the
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
questions and the debate we're having i
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
think there's still two a number of
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that i think we
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
need to look at this bill and there may
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
be some changes we need to make in the
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
language before we pass it and become
 
01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.270 align:start position:0%
language before we pass it and become
law

01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm very sensitive as a long-time
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
member and former chair of the long
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
range committee
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
of how we do things
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
we've got to be very careful in doing
 
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.149 align:start position:0%
we've got to be very careful in doing
this

01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm just concerned that you know we
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
could convey it to a non-profit
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
organization in the future who knows
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
what happens with that
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization but i i do like
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
the intent but i think it needs a little
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
bit more work and i think it could be
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
ready for consideration next term thank
 
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.830 align:start position:0%
ready for consideration next term thank
you

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
for those members of the committee
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
what interim study means is we will be
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
back here in the fall
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
to to work on and vote on this bill at
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
that point there are two options that
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
the committee can recommend
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation or
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
it is not just a polite way to kill a
 
01:31:54.159 --> 01:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
it is not just a polite way to kill a
bill

01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
so we would um be back i would try to do
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
it around the same time as veto day
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
rather than coming down a different day
 
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
rather than coming down a different day
but

01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
it does mean that we would be coming
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
back but it also means that we would
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity
 
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.350 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity
to

01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
actually drill down and
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what the bill should
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
say to be filed for the next
 
01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.910 align:start position:0%
say to be filed for the next
term

01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
what interim study means it has no
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
bearing on how you're going to vote this
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%

walking on the jetty

and when i was uh
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
walking my dogs with my wife a couple of
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
springs ago on at hampton beach
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
we were walking along and i'm just
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
looking at the jetty and i'm thinking
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
how many people got hurt on the jetty
 
03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
how many people walk out there that are
 
03:02:30.150 --> 03:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
very fit and they fall through the
 
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
cracks and they get hurt and i thought
 
03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:32.389 align:start position:0%
cracks and they get hurt and i thought
wow

03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
wow
 
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know why don't we build a pier over
 
03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
you know why don't we build a pier over
that

03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
i saw an old lady
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the at the end of the
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
beach near the pier so i ran over to her
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i embarrassed the heck out of my
 
03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
and i embarrassed the heck out of my
wife

03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
wife
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i said uh excuse me ma'am my name is
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
kevin avart i'm a senator
 
03:02:51.750 --> 03:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering i just want your
 
03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
opinion what do you think about appear
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
over this and she said oh my gosh i've
 
03:02:59.590 --> 03:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
never been on the jetty
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
she travels from new york
 
03:03:03.990 --> 03:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
every year with her sister to hampton
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
beach since she was seven years old
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i said wouldn't it be nice if if
 
03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that were disabled could
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually go out there where you know
 
03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
instead of just the fit people the the
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
people that are disabled or or veterans
 
03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
can get go out there and just maybe cast
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
the line out there and enjoy like what
 
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
like other people are doing
 
03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
and she said you know i would love that
 
03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
and i said oh well that's great thank
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
you very much for your opinion she says
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
oh by the way
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
my sister's at the the you know where
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
the restrooms are if you've ever been to
 
03:03:37.510 --> 03:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
hampton beach there's that that pavilion
 
03:03:39.750 --> 03:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
there where there's the restrooms are so
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
you can go to the restroom and go back
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
out onto the beach she's sitting in a
 
03:03:44.550 --> 03:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
wheelchair right now she's just sitting
 
03:03:46.469 --> 03:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
there just looking out at the ocean i
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
just went down here for a walk i thought
 
03:03:48.319 --> 03:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
just went down here for a walk i thought
wow

03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
wow
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
great idea
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i introduced a bill and uh we had a
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion and uh turned into a
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
study bill
 
03:04:00.870 --> 03:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the study bill basically we brought
 
03:04:03.750 --> 03:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
in uh you know people to testify to with
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
regards to you know let's let's build it
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
over the uh
 
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
the jetty
 
03:04:09.910 --> 03:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot there was a lot of
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
discussion a lot of people that were
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
local there they came in to to look at
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
that and uh they said well you know we
 
03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
got we got a headache with that
 
03:04:18.309 --> 03:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
and the headache is is that the army
 
03:04:20.550 --> 03:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
corps of engineers basically uh you know
 
03:04:22.469 --> 03:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
they would have issues with us building
 
03:04:24.389 --> 03:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
a pier over that and of course the you
 
03:04:27.750 --> 03:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
know it's there for a specific reason
 
03:04:29.910 --> 03:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
so some people offered up
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
a compromise that's something we do in
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
the senate we compromise and so
 
03:04:37.429 --> 03:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh somebody suggested well how about if
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
we just moved it instead of over the
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
the jetty
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
how about if we just put it up by boar's
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
head and there's a 10-year highway plan
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
out there that that it would coincide
 
03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
with that and we
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
we could uh you know look look at the
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of of having it there
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
and that way
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
people could drive up
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
park get in their wheelchair
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
and scroll out onto the jetty
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
not the jetty the pier and and and maybe
 
03:05:06.389 --> 03:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
cast an angle or those that are are
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
disabled that can get out there and
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
enjoy the ocean like the rest of us can
 
03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
that that are able-bodied
 
03:05:15.990 --> 03:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
so uh we came up with an amendment
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so and in the amendment the
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
basically is what this should be before
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
you uh the amendment by replacing all
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
after acting the clause with the
 
03:05:24.960 --> 03:05:26.389 align:start position:0%
after acting the clause with the
following

03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%

related

03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
related
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh to building a pier in the town of
 
03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:16.630 align:start position:0%
uh to building a pier in the town of
hampton

03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
hampton
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
the governor is authorized to draw a
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
warrant for said some amount
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
in the treasury not otherwise
 
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and the effective date is 60
 
03:06:29.429 --> 03:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
days after its passage the whole concept
 
03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
here is that you know we have the
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
penguin plunge
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
the disability community that that could
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
benefit from this and by the way you
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
know there would also be a tourist draw
 
03:06:45.990 --> 03:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
if we can at least pass this stage of of
 
03:06:48.150 --> 03:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and you know at least look at
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of you know is this is
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
this appropriate
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
can we do it
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
what about the weather and i keep
 
03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
reminding people
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's piers in florida there's peers
 
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
at myrtle beach if you've been to myrtle
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
beach there's piers that
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
in new jersey
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
so piers are possible and they can be
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
made in such a way that
 
03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're weather resistant or they can
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
tolerate the weather but the whole
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
reason for this is so that the
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
disability community
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
can enjoy what we enjoy
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so i
 
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at all your smiling faces
 
03:07:26.150 --> 03:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that you would join me and
 
03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
03:07:27.279 --> 03:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
pass this
so

03:07:28.150 --> 03:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll take any
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any ah thank you
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
senator questions of the senator
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
what would cost 150 000 to study like
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
what would that money be used for uh
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
again it would be an engineering
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
feasibility study and uh it it was the
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
number was derived on the potential cost
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the actual pier so it's about 10
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
percent uh
 
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
earmarked it's it's it's not a
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
scientific number but it's
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's what uh my understanding is is
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
when i look at the handout
 
03:08:13.510 --> 03:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
when i look at the bill line two it says
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh appear directly south of boer's head
 
03:08:20.070 --> 03:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
but on the next page in the methodology
 
03:08:22.469 --> 03:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
it says uh directly north of borah's
 
03:08:22.479 --> 03:08:23.269 align:start position:0%
it says uh directly north of borah's
head

03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
head
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
i would think that the people of hampton
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
that really matters is north or south of
 
03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
boris head
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
which would you prefer
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
i let the study tell us
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh i believe it is the south
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
part it's it's it's the northern part of
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
the beach but south of boer's head if i
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
understand correctly but i have some
 
03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
professionals from me that can actually
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
answer uh
 
03:08:44.319 --> 03:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
answer uh
uh

03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
in more detail but i think that's that
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it'll get worked out in the
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
details yeah thank you thank you for the
 
03:08:52.319 --> 03:08:58.389 align:start position:0%
details yeah thank you thank you for the
question

03:08:58.389 --> 03:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:58.399 --> 03:09:02.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:09:02.309 --> 03:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator could you
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
give us your vision of this pier
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh the size of it is it going to have
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
businesses on it is it going to have a
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
bait store on it or is it just going to
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
be a small walkway pier
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
do you envision it being 200 feet long
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
and can you just give us an idea of what
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
your vision of the pier is well my
 
03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
personal vision was uh probably the
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
length of
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
say the
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
the jetty that was my personal vision
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
but i know that the local community will
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
have more of a say on on the length of
 
03:09:35.600 --> 03:09:36.309 align:start position:0%
have more of a say on on the length of
it

03:09:36.309 --> 03:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
and the use of it but uh keeping in mind
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
that my primary function here is for
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
people to go out on the pier
 
03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:45.830 align:start position:0%
people to go out on the pier
uh

03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
not just an ad not not just a
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward but something where
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
people can actually go out on a pier and
 
03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
people can actually go out on a pier and
fish

03:09:52.950 --> 03:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
fish
 
03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:53.750 align:start position:0%
fish
or

03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
go out and enjoy the breeze in
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do on the pier
 
03:10:03.670 --> 03:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
in in nashua we have um mine falls we're
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
all familiar with mine falls and of
 
03:10:05.439 --> 03:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
all familiar with mine falls and of
course

03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:10:09.990 --> 03:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's a walkway down mine falls
 
03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
there's a walkway down mine falls
and

03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
you got these little cutouts in the
 
03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:14.229 align:start position:0%
you got these little cutouts in the
walkway

03:10:14.229 --> 03:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
walkway
 
03:10:15.990 --> 03:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
and there's this drop-off
 
03:10:18.389 --> 03:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
and then there's a bunch of weeds
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay so you can go up there and you can
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
pretend you're going to fish but the
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
rail's so high
 
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
that you know people can't uh they
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
really can't you can go out there and
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
you can be stuck in a little cove so i
 
03:10:32.229 --> 03:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
want it to be handicapped if you will
 
03:10:32.239 --> 03:10:33.429 align:start position:0%
want it to be handicapped if you will
friendly

03:10:33.429 --> 03:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
but uh i would like the locals to
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
actually talk about the the the scope
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
and size of it but it's specifically so
 
03:10:42.229 --> 03:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
that people of all walks of life can get
 
03:10:45.269 --> 03:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
out there enjoy the ocean fish off it i
 
03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a pavilion at the
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
end of it but i do also know that there
 
03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
was a discussion
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
for rescue search and rescue i don't
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
know if you know that in at the jetty a
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
lot of people get hurt every year
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a local cost for
 
03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
people getting hurt
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you've ever watched how they had
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
to to pull up a boat and get the people
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
out there to rescue these people that
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
have fallen in the in the jetty at the
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
end of the pier maybe maybe have a a
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
certain area where you can have the the
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
sea doo's if you will to so you don't
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh traverse the the breakers a place for
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
search and rescue to be able to be
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
parked there as well so it gives them an
 
03:11:24.550 --> 03:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
advantage over the tidal waves or
 
03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
advantage over the tidal waves or
whatever

03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that the the local uh
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
people there should have more of a say
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
as to because they have to live with it
 
03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh so but i i just that's my
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
vision is for people to be able to go
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
out there and enjoy a quality uh
 
03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
out there and enjoy a quality uh
um

03:11:45.590 --> 03:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's such a word but
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's good fishing and there's bad
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
fishing and
 
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
i want them to be able to enjoy it in in
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
such a way that they can take advantage
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
of it whereas we can
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that answers your
 
03:12:00.309 --> 03:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
question but uh
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
hi um senator abard so
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
usually what happens is that you would
 
03:12:12.550 --> 03:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
have a study committee or a commission
 
03:12:14.790 --> 03:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
that would investigate a certain idea
 
03:12:17.429 --> 03:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
and depending on the recommendations
 
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
then you might proceed with a
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
feasibility study in the appropriation
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
of money
 
03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
rather than wrapping the whole thing at
 
03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
once so i just wanted i wondered if you
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
could explain the
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
the process a little bit because it's
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
conceivable the commission might come
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
back after a preliminary study and and
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
decide that it's not a good idea and
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
then the money would already have been
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated i really appreciate the
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
question but this is a result of a study
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee that we had oh okay yeah and
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we we kind of uh went through all
 
03:12:51.670 --> 03:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
that and this is the result of that
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:12:55.349 --> 03:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh so we you know now we're at the the
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
feasibility part and of course i i
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
really think that the local people from
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
hampton would and the commission there
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
would have a uh a better grasp as as far
 
03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
as the design uh rather than uh the
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
state you know coming in saying hey we
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
want up here and so there'll be a
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
relationship between the state and the
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
local community uh with regards to it
 
03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
because it'll be a state park
 
03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
but i believe that there'll be a
 
03:13:20.550 --> 03:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
relationship with the local community as
 
03:13:22.710 --> 03:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
far as it's upkeep and whatnot but i can
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
let the senator stiles which i believe
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
is here former senator styles
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about that if
 
03:13:32.790 --> 03:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's okay and uh and end
 
03:13:35.429 --> 03:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:38.550 align:start position:0%
thank you further
questions

03:13:38.550 --> 03:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
cnn thanks very much
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so if i may i'm going to go
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
back over there and fight for your bills
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's what senator french would usually
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
say so i'm going to go over there and
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
try to fight for your bills thank you
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you mr chair
 
03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:52.630 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you mr chair
uh

03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:55.429 --> 03:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
next is another sponsor
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record my
 
03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
name is senator tom sherman district 24
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
which is hampton and hampton beach
 
03:14:14.469 --> 03:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm don't have a whole lot more to
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
add to what senator avart
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
said i just
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
this has been a really great process
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
through the committee
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
which i served on with senator evart as
 
03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:27.030 align:start position:0%
which i served on with senator evart as
chair

03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
lots of input lots of imagination and
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
really changing the idea of of this
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
walkway over a jetty to something that
 
03:14:35.279 --> 03:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
walkway over a jetty to something that
is

03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
really if you go up and down the east
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
coast or up and down the west coast some
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the highlights of those visits are
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
these piers jutting out into the water
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
and allowing disabled access
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the areas
 
03:14:53.190 --> 03:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
that would be really important to that
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
that beach is
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
allowing safety access out beyond the
 
03:14:58.160 --> 03:14:59.349 align:start position:0%
allowing safety access out beyond the
breakers

03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
breakers
 
03:15:02.070 --> 03:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
my son's a huge surfer and
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of being able to get beyond the
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
breakers to rescue somebody who's either
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
had been a victim of undertow or
 
03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise without having to go through
 
03:15:09.920 --> 03:15:11.349 align:start position:0%
otherwise without having to go through
them

03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
is is a big benefit to this but
 
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's really an exciting project it's uh
 
03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
it could be a huge draw
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
and just to answer representative
 
03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:22.630 align:start position:0%
and just to answer representative
evil's

03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
evil's
 
03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:24.469 align:start position:0%
evil's
concerns

03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:15:27.190 --> 03:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have started engaging
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
many different
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
just so you know there's
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
right now department of transportation
 
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
is looking at ocean boulevard and so the
 
03:15:40.469 --> 03:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner is aware of this and
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
is thinking how could this be
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated into some of the new work
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's going to be done in the new
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
design of ocean boulevard as it goes
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
through that area so
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
hugely exciting
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
something the community is rallying
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
around and
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
and i think it's also strikes
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
a real
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
balance between what's doable
 
03:16:01.359 --> 03:16:02.630 align:start position:0%
balance between what's doable
sustainable

03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
and also what's great for our disabled
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
population as well as for safety issues
 
03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
regarding that area of the seacoast so
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:16.880 align:start position:0%

03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%

hampton area chamber of commerce
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
i represent five communities
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
around the seacoast
 
03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
where we have
 
03:16:53.349 --> 03:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
over 500
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
members of the chamber of commerce
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
many of which are
 
03:16:59.670 --> 03:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
located along the seacoast
 
03:17:03.269 --> 03:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
from rye all the way down to seabrook
 
03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start and i'll keep my
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
comments brief
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
because i know you have a lot of work to
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
do but i'd like to start with showing
 
03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
pictures i believe pictures sometimes
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
says a lot more than words and i believe
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative newton you had asked
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
about the vision
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i have three pictures here that i'd
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
like just to share with the community if
 
03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's all right with you mr chairman
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
the first one is the jetty itself
 
03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and what it looks like and what it could
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
look like after
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
a storm
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
the second is a picture of exactly where
 
03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
we are proposing uh the pier to be
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
considered and then the third and most
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
importantly is what the pair would look
 
03:17:46.150 --> 03:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
like as our vision so if i may i'll pass
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
this around while i'm talking
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
and for the members of the committee as
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
long as they end up with the clerk we're
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
03:18:00.399 --> 03:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
good okay
okay

03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
back in october um when this was in fact
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
i attended the
 
03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:12.150 align:start position:0%
i attended the
senator's

03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
senator's
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
meeting up here in concord and
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
we had talked because i had spoken to a
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
number of business
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
owners along the beach and to talk about
 
03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
what they thought uh regarding the
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
present jetty and whether or not it
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to put a pier
 
03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
and the consensus was no it was too
 
03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:31.670 align:start position:0%
and the consensus was no it was too
dangerous

03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
with the the water coming in
 
03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:35.110 align:start position:0%
with the the water coming in
storms

03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
storms
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
it would just not be a a good place to
 
03:18:39.190 --> 03:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
put a
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
built up pier because it would be
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
probably in need of repair within the
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
first couple of years
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
so we had as a local community made a
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion for them to consider putting
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
a pier on hampton beach but not at the
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
jetty but right south
 
03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
of boy's head not north but south of
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
boy's head
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the picture as you will see as you
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
will get it you will see exactly where
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
i reference
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
so i was happy uh when the
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee decided that they would take
 
03:19:16.229 --> 03:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
our recommendation
 
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and move the the site of the pier
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
from a business perspective um i have
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
been associated with a number of
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
projects uh i was formerly prior to
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
senator stiles i was the chairman of the
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampton beach area commission for 10
 
03:19:31.760 --> 03:19:33.190 align:start position:0%
hampton beach area commission for 10
years

03:19:33.190 --> 03:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
was very much involved with the senator
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
and others with regard to the
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
redevelopment of hampton beach state
 
03:19:40.239 --> 03:19:41.269 align:start position:0%
redevelopment of hampton beach state
park

03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
park
 
03:19:43.830 --> 03:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we
 
03:19:43.840 --> 03:19:45.030 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we
proposed

03:19:45.030 --> 03:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
here in concord when we got that capital
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
funding was a return on investment
 
03:19:52.550 --> 03:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so from that point on we've always
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
looked at how do we create
 
03:19:57.190 --> 03:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
public-private partnerships the business
 
03:19:59.429 --> 03:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
community along with state parks how can
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
we continue to improve
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
the beach area
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
but do it in a way where we're also
 
03:20:08.070 --> 03:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
improving the revenue coming into the
 
03:20:08.080 --> 03:20:09.190 align:start position:0%
improving the revenue coming into the
state

03:20:09.190 --> 03:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
for those of you that might have
 
03:20:10.560 --> 03:20:11.910 align:start position:0%
for those of you that might have
followed

03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
followed
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the redevelopment
 
03:20:16.630 --> 03:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
the state gave us 14.5 million dollars
 
03:20:19.030 --> 03:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
to redevelop hampton beach state park
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 2011.
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
that money
 
03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
i believe has created not only more
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
money into the state revenue part but in
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
terms of across the street over 180
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
has been invested in either new
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
development or redevelopment on hampton
 
03:20:41.190 --> 03:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
beach today that's a lot of money
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
so when we look at this pier we look at
 
03:20:45.030 --> 03:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
it as an added
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
reason why you should come to hampton
 
03:20:47.439 --> 03:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
reason why you should come to hampton
beach

03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
beach
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
to enjoy
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
the beach
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
we have now hosted for our second year
 
03:20:55.750 --> 03:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
in a row a senior day
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
at the beach we take seniors from
 
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
nursing homes assisted livings senior
 
03:21:03.429 --> 03:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
clubs and we treat them to a day at the
 
03:21:03.439 --> 03:21:04.469 align:start position:0%
clubs and we treat them to a day at the
beach

03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
beach
 
03:21:06.150 --> 03:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i was just thinking the other day
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be so nice
 
03:21:10.550 --> 03:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
to have as part of that program for the
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
seniors to be able to come and walk to
 
03:21:14.790 --> 03:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
the pier and actually walk out into the
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
ocean wouldn't that be a nice experience
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
for all of them
 
03:21:18.239 --> 03:21:19.110 align:start position:0%
for all of them
so

03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying um gentlemen and ladies
 
03:21:22.720 --> 03:21:23.830 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying um gentlemen and ladies
that

03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:25.830 --> 03:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that we
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
move forward with this study
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions that still
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
cannot be answered because of it being
 
03:21:36.229 --> 03:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
still in a feasibility comp status and i
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
think part of the reason why
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
we want to to move forward is to see
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
there is feasibility in doing this i
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
know the business community is in full
 
03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
support of this concept
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
we work very well with state parks on a
 
03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
number of uh initiatives and so we would
 
03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
be working with state parks and any
 
03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
other organizations so i would ask uh
 
03:22:02.309 --> 03:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
this committee to uh vote in favor of
 
03:22:04.150 --> 03:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
moving this forward and i'd be more than
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%

03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a study
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
even if we were to pass it and give you
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%

03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
record i am nancy stiles
 
03:24:53.349 --> 03:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
and currently chair of the hampton beach
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
area commission which is an advisory
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
committee to both the state and the town
 
03:25:01.590 --> 03:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
to improve the economic development at
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
hampton beach that's what
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
one of our tasks is
 
03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:09.349 align:start position:0%
one of our tasks is
volunteered

03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
this um this whole project um
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
will be a huge addition to the beach as
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
far as those with walking disabled many
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
of you some of you may know that when i
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
was served in the house i was adamant
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
that we look at our walking disabled
 
03:25:28.229 --> 03:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
community that they deserved as many
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
rights as we have
 
03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
and when senator avad mentioned to me
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to put up a pier that
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
would be accessible for walking disabled
 
03:25:43.990 --> 03:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
and i want to refer to the time schedule
 
03:25:46.640 --> 03:25:47.670 align:start position:0%
and i want to refer to the time schedule
that

03:25:47.670 --> 03:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
chairman just spoke to of november 1st
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's when the report would be due
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
i know that it'll go through this
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm hoping it can move as
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible with deliberation as
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
you go through and then it'll probably
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
have to go to finance is that correct
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
finance and then i'll go to the floor
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
and then i'll have to get signed and uh
 
03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
governor will have to okay it
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
so you're right it'll probably be june
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
at best
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
before it would get all the way through
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
i think that is one of the reasons why
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
they put that amount of money in in the
 
03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
senate knowing that it is going to take
 
03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
a heavy hammer
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
to get that job done
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
and any of you that have worked with me
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the past know that i am about
 
03:26:32.640 --> 03:26:34.550 align:start position:0%
in the past know that i am about
deadlines

03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the deadline is november 1st
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
and as if i am put in charge
 
03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions you'd like to
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
ask me i mean the the commission that i
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
sit on in case some of you may not know
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
is made up of two members of uh the town
 
03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
two members of the village district at
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
the beach
 
03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
park state parks
 
03:27:05.349 --> 03:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
and d.o.t
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
the chamber of commerce
 
03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:09.030 align:start position:0%
the chamber of commerce
the

03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
members of the business community
 
03:27:11.359 --> 03:27:12.830 align:start position:0%
members of the business community
rockingham

03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
planning and an ad hoc person
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
so there's nine of us on the commission
 
03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
so there's nine of us on the commission
and

03:27:19.750 --> 03:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
they are dedicated to working together
 
03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
so if you have questions for me about
 
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
the pier um one of the things in the
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
feasibility study one of the things that
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think that they will find out is is
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
south of
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
buzz head the best place to put it
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things i think they
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
will discover in the feasibility so if
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
you have a question about whether it's
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
north or south i think you'll get that
 
03:27:48.239 --> 03:27:50.309 align:start position:0%
north or south i think you'll get that
answer

03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.190 --> 03:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
has anybody considered the feasibility
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
of the parking because you this pier is
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
being pushed as handicapped accessible
 
03:28:12.070 --> 03:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
and how much more handicapped accessible
 
03:28:12.080 --> 03:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
and how much more handicapped accessible
parking

03:28:13.110 --> 03:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
parking
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
will you need and is it feasible
 
03:28:19.030 --> 03:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
to have as much
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
handicap parking as you will need for
 
03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
the draw that it's going to be with all
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
these handicapped people
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to use the pier because right now
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
i go to hampton quite a bit and it's
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful it's great which you guys have
 
03:28:33.279 --> 03:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
wonderful it's great which you guys have
done

03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
to date but the parking is always a
 
03:28:36.399 --> 03:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
to date but the parking is always a
problem

03:28:37.590 --> 03:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:28:40.630 --> 03:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
a big problem so i'd like to hear if you
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
discuss that or you'll be talking about
 
03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
that with your feasibility study well we
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
finished the
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
updating of the master plan for tr
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
transportation we're in the process now
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
of doing it for the environmental
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
component and that parking area was part
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
of the study for the
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
part of our study for the uh
 
03:29:03.990 --> 03:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
transportation component of our master
 
03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
plan and yes there would be room for to
 
03:29:09.269 --> 03:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
do that because many of you may know
 
03:29:11.590 --> 03:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
that at hampton beach if you are walking
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
disabled you can park anywhere
 
03:29:15.990 --> 03:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
for nothing
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that's scheduled for
 
03:29:19.990 --> 03:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
anybody in particular but there would
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
have to be a special area pulled off and
 
03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
so we would be in a communication with
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
the engineering group that is is doing
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
route 1a
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's an engineering group that is
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
studying the layout of route 1a so we if
 
03:29:36.070 --> 03:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
this goes through
 
03:29:38.550 --> 03:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
we would be in communication with that
 
03:29:41.190 --> 03:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
engineering group to make sure that that
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
is accounted for so that the walking
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
disabled would have a place to park
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:51.349 --> 03:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative edgar
 
03:29:55.590 --> 03:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
it seems that uh some of the urgency
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
that you've been expressing uh has to do
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
with the fact that ocean boulevard is in
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the design
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
process right now is that correct that's
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
correct okay so it does
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
lend some urgency to it
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes please
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
besides besides comments excuse me sir
 
03:30:17.680 --> 03:30:19.349 align:start position:0%
besides besides comments excuse me sir
um

03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:30:22.710 --> 03:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
the other one is is it um you had
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned your commitment uh
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and you still feel strongly that uh if
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
you if this is passed then you get the
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
money in your hands by around the
 
03:30:35.190 --> 03:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
earliest time i believe by this would be
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
june 31st that you'll be able to
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
complete this work
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
by november 1st i can work as quickly as
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
you do so yes
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
well maybe a little quicker

thank you for saying them thank you i
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
would remind committee members if there

is no eating or drinking within the
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%

03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:17.670 align:start position:0%
pelletier
in

03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
which is not what the letter i got from
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
your boss this morning said
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's why that's actually why i'm here
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think we really
 
03:31:31.750 --> 03:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
have a part in this bill but what
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
by design that i had sent over to you
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
was so it provided some sort of a
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
history of where we were
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
as you can see on 347 we did the fiscal
 
03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
note and pretty much said that we didn't
 
03:31:45.910 --> 03:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the in-house expertise
 
03:31:45.920 --> 03:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
have the in-house expertise
so

03:31:46.950 --> 03:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
my feeling was when we sent that letter
 
03:31:51.750 --> 03:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
that it would more serve as a little
 
03:31:51.760 --> 03:31:52.950 align:start position:0%
that it would more serve as a little
history

03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
we were fortunate enough to be asked to
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the study committee
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
as you can see in the letter if you had
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
a chance to read that we had some
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions talking with senator stiles
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
and other members of the committee
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
it was really refreshing to see the
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
approach that senator avad took for an
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
03:32:15.750 --> 03:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
as you know we permit all structures
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
that are built on the seacoast
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
and we feel that historically the port
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
authority does a lot of this work they
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
do a lot of feasibility studies to in
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
in in fact determine the safety the
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
location the depth the tide all that
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
stuff so the approach i think is uh the
 
03:32:34.239 --> 03:32:35.269 align:start position:0%
stuff so the approach i think is uh the
norm

03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
norm
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:32:38.229 --> 03:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to see that the bill was
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
amended and
 
03:32:40.870 --> 03:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
03:32:44.710 --> 03:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr pelletier actually i
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%

so
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
um we we do appreciate the support of
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
the senate and the changes they made to
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
to enable the hampton beach area
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
commission which we sit on to lead the
 
03:34:32.640 --> 03:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
commission which we sit on to lead the
study

03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
that commission assists the town and the
 
03:34:36.640 --> 03:34:37.830 align:start position:0%
that commission assists the town and the
state

03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the planning around hampton beach
 
03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:42.150 align:start position:0%
in the planning around hampton beach
uh

03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
we do know that there's a lot of
 
03:34:46.630 --> 03:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
interest in that type of experience
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
because of the people that uh you
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
utilize the pier
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
i mean the um not the peer the jetty
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
and um while we have our lifeguards on
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
in the summer and end up having to do
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
rescues out there
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh in the winter time we don't and that
 
03:35:06.389 --> 03:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
falls on the town um or uh or other
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
resources to help people out there
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
so we know that there's demand for this
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
this would provide an alternative for
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
folks to get out over the water
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
we assume that a consult would be hired
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
to conduct the studies
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
and as a point of reference and as
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
design costs are generally 10 of the
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
construction costs with that with that
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
in mind of course the senate amended uh
 
03:35:29.190 --> 03:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
the division very much supports
 
03:35:36.870 --> 03:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
improvements across the
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
park system improve accessibility to the
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
outdoors one of our latest projects is
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
the fishing platform and trail up in
 
03:35:45.750 --> 03:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
franconia notch state park at the old
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
man memorial if you haven't had a chance
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
to go up there of course it's a gorgeous
 
03:35:49.439 --> 03:35:50.389 align:start position:0%
to go up there of course it's a gorgeous
spot

03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
spot
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh um
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
memorial itself is is is pretty uh neat
 
03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
memorial itself is is is pretty uh neat
spot

03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
spot
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
in addition uh the pier would provide an
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
additional attraction that could
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
increase off season uh visitation that
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
has been one of our efforts
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
we we actually now operate our restrooms
 
03:36:10.229 --> 03:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
year round we plow the sidewalks we plow
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
parking lots that that
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
that used to not happen
 
03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
and um if you're out there particularly
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the even in the late fall or
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
particularly in the early spring there's
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are out
 
03:36:22.319 --> 03:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are out
using

03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
using
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
using the beach
 
03:36:27.910 --> 03:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
and the facilities that we provide there
 
03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
and the facilities that we provide there
and

03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
however as mentioned
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
earlier an essential part of the
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
feasibility impact study would be to
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
understanding the impact on and degree
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
of support from the community local law
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement emergency services and of
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
course the abutters to the pier
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
whoever would be responsible for
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
managing the pier would likely also want
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
to to understand any operating costs
 
03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:51.990 align:start position:0%
to to understand any operating costs
including

03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
including
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the lifespan of the pier
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
to consider future replacement and
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
revenue support in revenue to
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
support those costs this is particularly
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
important given of course the impact
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
that winter storms uh have on structures
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
along the seacoast however there are
 
03:37:08.399 --> 03:37:09.590 align:start position:0%
along the seacoast however there are
peers

03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
peers
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
as you all know up and down the entire
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
eastern seaboard so there's plenty of
 
03:37:15.910 --> 03:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
examples thank you very much for the
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony i'm
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions
 
03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:21.349 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions
questions

03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
now i'll ask my question
 
03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
um mr price what is the
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
geographic boundaries for hampton beach
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
state park
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the best response would be for me to
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
look to get a map of that for you uh the
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
beach itself is the
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
um would be the sand um
 
03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:48.630 align:start position:0%
um would be the sand um
uh

03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:51.750 --> 03:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
as you as you go towards the south side
 
03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:52.469 align:start position:0%
as you as you go towards the south side
of

03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
um boar's head
 
03:37:54.560 --> 03:37:56.070 align:start position:0%
um boar's head
um

03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
at that end and down at the uh
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
south end of course it would be along
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
the edge of the rv park there out to the
 
03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
the edge of the rv park there out to the
pier

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
pier
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
so um and then you have north beach it's
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
right basically at the end of the sea
 
03:38:08.960 --> 03:38:09.830 align:start position:0%
right basically at the end of the sea
wall

03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
wall
 
03:38:11.190 --> 03:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then runs all the way up and
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
intersects with the town uh with the
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
town park but i could provide a map if
 
03:38:18.790 --> 03:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
we um if you if if you would like like
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
to see one please and one more follow-up
 
03:38:24.389 --> 03:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you
 
03:38:26.309 --> 03:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
mr bryson your testimony you talked
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
about the management of the peer did i i
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't mean to be put words in your mouth
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
but i inferred from it that that would
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
be something that would not be managed
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
by the state but would be contracted out
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
is that of is that a fair assumption
 
03:38:38.479 --> 03:38:39.429 align:start position:0%
is that of is that a fair assumption
well

03:38:39.429 --> 03:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:38:39.439 --> 03:38:40.710 align:start position:0%
well
i

03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:38:42.790 --> 03:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to speculate or assume
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be parks that
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
manage it if it's for fishing it could
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
be fish and game it could be the um you
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
know the uh um
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
another authority that that does
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
that you know does that work
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
um so we just we just left that
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to make the assumption
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be parks that was
 
03:39:03.670 --> 03:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
actually managing the pier
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
well we might be managing while we would
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
continue to obviously manage the
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
associated resources such as the parking
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
lots and the restrooms that would
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
support that
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'll defer mr chamberfield
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.910 --> 03:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have do we have
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
handicapped accessible
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
access to the beaches currently
 
03:39:35.439 --> 03:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
access to the beaches currently
and

03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
i know we have handicapped accessible
 
03:39:39.359 --> 03:39:40.710 align:start position:0%
i know we have handicapped accessible
wheelchairs

03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there's a cost for
 
03:39:43.990 --> 03:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
those and
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you could explain how
 
03:39:48.630 --> 03:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
people would get onto the beach
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah for people that that can't handle
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
the walking across the sand
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
we have two things one is we we
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've actually changed to use a new
 
03:40:03.030 --> 03:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
technology around some mats um
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
and gotten rid of the wooden
 
03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
um the wooden platforms that go out onto
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
the beach to let people get out onto the
 
03:40:09.760 --> 03:40:10.790 align:start position:0%
the beach to let people get out onto the
sand

03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
sand
 
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that is one thing because it the sand
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
can be a little difficult if you have uh
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
any and it's it's difficult to move a um
 
03:40:18.080 --> 03:40:18.950 align:start position:0%
any and it's it's difficult to move a um
uh

03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
can be difficult to move across the sand
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
so this makes it easier for people to
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
walk with a you know if they're they're
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
have assistance the primary way though
 
03:40:28.950 --> 03:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
that people uh get out on the beach is
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
with the the beach wheelchairs with the
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
big wheels
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh and that's how they and that's how
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
they access the um you know get out
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
further into the sand our lifeguards
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
operate that program i'm not sure how
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
many chairs we have but we continue to
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
try to continue to
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
to get more um and make it more variable
 
03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:48.389 align:start position:0%
to get more um and make it more variable
uh

03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
available i can tell you
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's it they get a lot of use and i
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
can i can give you those numbers but i
 
03:40:57.030 --> 03:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't have them off the top of my head
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
just to follow this to speak um if we
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
could keep the questions
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
to the feasibility study on whether or
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
not we are going to do it and not other
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of the
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
i think i'm in a bit of a gray zone so
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and ask the
 
03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:23.110 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and ask the
question

03:41:23.110 --> 03:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
i mean it
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
the the the state is being asked to fund
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
the feasibility study and then i did
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
also notice the information here that
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
you weren't clear on who would be
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
managing the peer
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
is it ultimately
 
03:41:43.750 --> 03:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
the concept that the cost of the peer if
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
it proved feasible would be a
 
03:41:48.150 --> 03:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
state park
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget sort of an item or is
 
03:41:50.720 --> 03:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
capital budget sort of an item or is
that

03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
of course there's multiple sources of
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
funding that are around right now um
 
03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:02.710 align:start position:0%
funding that are around right now um
and

03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:05.590 --> 03:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
um the if i could just jump back it is
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
my assumption it would be a state agency
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
that would run it because the state's
 
03:42:11.429 --> 03:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
providing the it's just not sure which
 
03:42:13.750 --> 03:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
entity would be the one to do that
 
03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh the source of funding i that's and
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
up to
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
um you know the legislature and the
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
i mean we're just following
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative peterson go ahead it's
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
all right no i was just going to i'm
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair no no i already called on
 
03:42:39.030 --> 03:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge does the state of
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
maine have any peers
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
similar to the design being proposed
 
03:42:49.120 --> 03:42:51.110 align:start position:0%
similar to the design being proposed
here

03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
someone else here might know that the
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
answer to that question we have not
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
explored this at all ourselves any
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
further um really
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh obviously at that point at which um a
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
decision is made we would move forward i
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
i would think that maine would have have
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
some peers i know there's peers to the
 
03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:09.189 align:start position:0%
some peers i know there's peers to the
south

03:43:09.189 --> 03:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
south
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts that i think is
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
operated by their fishing game
 
03:43:14.950 --> 03:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
department for uh for fishing maine we
 
03:43:18.309 --> 03:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
did not um we haven't asked about
 
03:43:20.309 --> 03:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up does it deal with the
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
feasibility study
 
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.640 --> 03:43:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:33.750 --> 03:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative evil back
 
03:43:37.120 --> 03:43:40.710 align:start position:0%
representative evil back
okay

03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
03:43:46.150 --> 03:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes and i'm going to direct this um to
 
03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
the feasibility study thank you
 
03:43:48.960 --> 03:43:50.070 align:start position:0%
the feasibility study thank you
um

03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
not knowing it
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay if if you don't know that there are
 
03:43:54.239 --> 03:43:55.110 align:start position:0%
okay if if you don't know that there are
any

03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
similar peers in maine
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
but there are some in massachusetts
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to confirm that the
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
feasibility study in all likelihood
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
would include
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
winter weather conditions and peer
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
upkeep maintenance and
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
accessibility issues
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very good question and i i
 
03:44:21.510 --> 03:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
addressed that and completely supported
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
that in my testimony which um the folks
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner
 
03:44:31.990 --> 03:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm pretty sure this is related to
 
03:44:33.990 --> 03:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
the visibility study
 
03:44:37.030 --> 03:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
will you be able to look at
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
other ways of funding ongoing
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance and i'm particularly
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about whether
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's feasible to charge concessionaires
 
03:44:47.349 --> 03:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
bait sales but whatever
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
for use of the property whether the some
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions that might limit the
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
03:44:54.790 --> 03:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
for additional sources of ongoing
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
maintenance income
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
yes a good question again i i'm hoping
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
that in the feasibility study that the
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance costs are identified
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
and and then there's alternative sources
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
of funding it could be that the
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
community comes forward and supports
 
03:45:12.150 --> 03:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
those maintenance costs i've heard that
 
03:45:14.309 --> 03:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
idea thrown out as opposed to requiring
 
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
the park system or the state to support
 
03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:18.790 align:start position:0%
the park system or the state to support
it

03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
03:45:20.880 --> 03:45:22.469 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
um

03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
you're the second person who referred to
 
03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:25.349 align:start position:0%
you're the second person who referred to
the

03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:45:28.150 --> 03:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
150 000 as
 
03:45:30.870 --> 03:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
10 of the cost
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
is am i assuming that the cost is
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
a million and a half dollars to build
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
this beer because
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
03:45:43.990 --> 03:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
not sure you can do it for that
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
um representative thompson always a good
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
question uh we knew that the amount they
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
put in the original mill which i think
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
was 25 000 was not nearly sufficient
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very good question uh you
 
03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
know it
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
it was to give a sense of of the scale
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
that at least it's going to cost a
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
million and a half so you need 150 000
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
to do this study but a very good
 
03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
question we don't know the cost you know
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
the the costs of everything have gone up
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
as you know substantially so we'll
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
we'd have to
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
again they'll have to identify that and
 
03:46:21.910 --> 03:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
the size and scale of the peer may be
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
dictated by the cost so
 
03:46:27.269 --> 03:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:46:31.359 --> 03:46:32.469 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
i have no further pink cards is anybody
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
who has not spoken wish to
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
testify about
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
senate bill 346 is anybody who's
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
testified once we should speak a second
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
time see none i will close the public
 
03:46:53.189 --> 03:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 346.
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill it has to be
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
so i would like to open the executive
 
03:47:05.429 --> 03:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
session on senate bill 346.
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
um if the committee is not willing to do
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll be back here probably next
 
03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:12.150 align:start position:0%
that we'll be back here probably next
tuesday

03:47:12.150 --> 03:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just being honest
 
03:47:14.160 --> 03:47:19.830 align:start position:0%
i'm just being honest
um

03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
let's do a little bit of general
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
discussion at before we take a motion
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative edgar um
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
because i know what your emotion will
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
anybody have any generalized comments
 
03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:37.910 align:start position:0%
anybody have any generalized comments
about

03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should accept this
 
03:47:40.399 --> 03:47:43.269 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should accept this
bill

03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative thompson i do
 
03:47:45.439 --> 03:47:46.950 align:start position:0%
representative thompson i do
um

03:47:46.950 --> 03:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
i probably have
 
03:47:52.150 --> 03:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
as much experience with hampton beach as
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
to try and put a appear at boar's head
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
south of boar's head
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure that
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
the director as well as senator styles
 
03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:12.469 align:start position:0%
the director as well as senator styles
can

03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
can comment on when there's a high tide
 
03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
or an exceptional high tide
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
where does the water come over the sea
 
03:48:22.710 --> 03:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
wall at hampton beach
 
03:48:26.309 --> 03:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
right where you propose to put the pier
 
03:48:26.319 --> 03:48:27.429 align:start position:0%
right where you propose to put the pier
and

03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
that area i believe
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
we senator styles you'd call the rocky
 
03:48:34.150 --> 03:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
part of the beach if you could not
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
address people in the audience we are
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
having a discussion among members of the
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee i would appreciate it because
 
03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
they cannot respond at this point
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the public hearing is closed
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
so if you have comments address them to
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee please okay
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that uh
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that area is not
 
03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
that area is not
um

03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
what i would call a constructable area
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the sea coast
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
particularly on hampton beach just
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
because of the way the tides run run
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
as we all know
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
you call it climate change you can call
 
03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
it whatever you want
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's having effect on our beaches and
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
our seacoast i construct sea walls on
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
the seacoast
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
as a matter of
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
course and
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
i've worked for recently has asked to
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
raised it's just
 
03:49:42.309 --> 03:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
i i guess i would have to see
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
how high this pier is supposed to be
 
03:49:47.910 --> 03:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
um is it going to be above clear tide
 
03:49:49.110 --> 03:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
an exceptional high tide if it isn't
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for people to be
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
swept off
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
the pier
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
at low tide
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
the area they're talking about is
 
03:50:02.640 --> 03:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
the area they're talking about is
exceptionally

03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
exceptionally
 
03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:05.189 align:start position:0%
exceptionally
shallow

03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
shallow
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if someone were to jump off it
 
03:50:10.229 --> 03:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
thinking they had 20 feet of water
 
03:50:12.150 --> 03:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
underneath them i think they'd have a
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
rude awakening when their feet hit the
 
03:50:14.720 --> 03:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
rude awakening when their feet hit the
bottom

03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
um i just i
 
03:50:19.990 --> 03:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
am not in favor of this at all
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative klasik
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:22.720 --> 03:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
well i don't think that we're arguing
 
03:50:28.150 --> 03:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
about whether we're going to build
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
a peer or not that's not what the bill
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
is the bill is whether there should be a
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
feasibility study where they will
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you took
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
something representative boyd you've had
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
your hand up for a while sorry
 
03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's okay mr chairman thank you i
 
03:50:45.199 --> 03:50:46.469 align:start position:0%
that's okay mr chairman thank you i

03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative lasik's comments that
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
we're gonna talk about the feasibility
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
not about the location what i
 
03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
what i can say is that
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
respecting representative thompson's
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the area and my knowledge
 
03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:00.309 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the area and my knowledge
of

03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:51:00.319 --> 03:51:01.349 align:start position:0%
of
having

03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
i'm an active runner and i love running
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
up and down to the north beach and back
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
that that's i personally feel that's a
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
tough location but that's going to be
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
the community's decision to decide so
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's one particular point number two
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
to go to representative peterson's point
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
the only three peers that i know of a
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
castle island rockport and in the old
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
port of portland on the on the on the
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
north side by where the uh where the
 
03:51:26.229 --> 03:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
railroad used to be located those are
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
the only three that come to mind off the
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
top of my head so i think
 
03:51:32.150 --> 03:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
looking and exploring that as a
 
03:51:32.160 --> 03:51:33.189 align:start position:0%
looking and exploring that as a
potential

03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
potential
 
03:51:36.150 --> 03:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
destination for our state i think
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
is particularly noteworthy because it's
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's to me those things are really kind
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
of kind of unique and then the the last
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
point that i would make is that
 
03:51:47.910 --> 03:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
within the context of this feasibility
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
study i would hope because i i really
 
03:51:51.910 --> 03:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
feel it's a stallion point what are the
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
true boundaries of the hampton beach
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
state park because we certainly don't
 
03:51:56.710 --> 03:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
want to be looking at a site and not
 
03:51:58.150 --> 03:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
have it be a part of the state park
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
because then technically it's going to
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
be somebody else's responsibility to
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
consent so
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
those are the points i wanted to make my
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues aware of mr chairman thank
 
03:52:06.399 --> 03:52:07.269 align:start position:0%
colleagues aware of mr chairman thank
you

03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative abbott
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to the feasibility study
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
i just don't think
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
the first of november
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
a good day to
 
03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
have this done and i question how
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
thorough a study could be
 
03:52:27.840 --> 03:52:28.630 align:start position:0%
thorough a study could be
done

03:52:28.630 --> 03:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:52:32.309 --> 03:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
if if this doesn't pass until june
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i have to
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
concur with representative abbott
 
03:52:48.560 --> 03:52:49.990 align:start position:0%
concur with representative abbott
i

03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
either what comes to my mind with the
 
03:52:54.630 --> 03:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
deadline is haste makes waste and i
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
think there's a whole lot of stuff to
 
03:52:56.319 --> 03:52:57.670 align:start position:0%
think there's a whole lot of stuff to
consider

03:52:57.670 --> 03:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
with the weather
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
with the area and i just don't see
 
03:53:04.630 --> 03:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
how it could be done in such short order
 
03:53:06.150 --> 03:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
and be
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
thorough and complete
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
to move forward i do think that a study
 
03:53:13.830 --> 03:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
should be done and and i would suggest
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
maybe if somebody could get the local
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
businesses to pony up 50 or 75 grand and
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
they could get started on it on their
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
own they would have a good jump start on
 
03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:23.590 align:start position:0%
own they would have a good jump start on
it

03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:25.510 --> 03:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
and just make sure
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
the eyes are dotted and the t's are
 
03:53:27.359 --> 03:53:28.469 align:start position:0%
the eyes are dotted and the t's are
crossed

03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
crossed
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the legislature for
 
03:53:30.399 --> 03:53:31.830 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the legislature for
money

03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:53:34.150 --> 03:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
but i do think that needs to be a study
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
done i just don't see how it can be done
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
by november 1st
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um and to propose an amendment
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows and everybody in
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
this room should know it
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
our term ends the first tuesday
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
after the first what first wednesday
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
after the first tuesday
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
in december so any reports that were due
 
03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be done before then um
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
because this term will be finished
 
03:54:04.880 --> 03:54:05.670 align:start position:0%
because this term will be finished
um

03:54:05.670 --> 03:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
so even
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
trying to amend this to a later date in
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
the spring or something would would not
 
03:54:11.840 --> 03:54:12.550 align:start position:0%
the spring or something would would not
be

03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
useful i served on one committee at one
 
03:54:15.359 --> 03:54:16.389 align:start position:0%
useful i served on one committee at one
point

03:54:16.389 --> 03:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it had a report date in the
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
following like january february and the
 
03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:24.229 align:start position:0%
following like january february and the
speaker

03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
03:54:26.229 --> 03:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
newly elected speaker at the time just
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
went nope you're done it's all finished
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
we've never even made a report
 
03:54:31.359 --> 03:54:32.550 align:start position:0%
we've never even made a report
it it

03:54:32.550 --> 03:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
it it
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
is tough to do
 
03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:35.670 align:start position:0%
is tough to do
um

03:54:35.670 --> 03:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
each one of us will have to make up our
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
mind whether or not
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
um doing this kind of a study
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
um quickly um
 
03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
is worth it for the long term of the
 
03:54:48.399 --> 03:54:49.670 align:start position:0%
is worth it for the long term of the
state

03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
um that being said
 
03:54:52.319 --> 03:54:53.830 align:start position:0%
um that being said
um

03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
03:54:57.269 --> 03:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman a question to you

03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
this time
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to go over to legislative
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
services and get a
 
03:55:08.309 --> 03:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
we will all wait for you
 
03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.150 --> 03:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's the only way it can be done
 
03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's the only way it can be done
or

03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
if the committee so chooses
 
03:55:22.150 --> 03:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
i can schedule a meeting next tuesday i
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to come next tuesday if the
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee is willing to indulge me for a
 
03:55:30.150 --> 03:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.710 --> 03:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
two hours oh boy i don't keep okay at
 
03:55:35.349 --> 03:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
least an hour at least an hour okay
 
03:55:35.359 --> 03:55:37.990 align:start position:0%
least an hour at least an hour okay
um

03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
however i will remind everybody that
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to finance from here
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
and the amount
 
03:55:48.070 --> 03:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
can be amended at that point
 
03:55:48.080 --> 03:55:49.110 align:start position:0%
can be amended at that point
um

03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
whoever writes the committee report can
 
03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
can make a recommendation that they need
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount or or a minority
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
report if it comes down to that um
 
03:56:05.120 --> 03:56:06.070 align:start position:0%
report if it comes down to that um
but

03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows we
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
this goes into the calendar that is
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
published a week from thursday
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
one way or the other it goes into that
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
calendar we will vote on it on the 21st
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
of april
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
it then goes to finance assuming that it
 
03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
passes the floor
 
03:56:30.150 --> 03:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
or if it doesn't then it's dead um
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
and then they have to work it in and
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
they have until the first week or so in
 
03:56:37.110 --> 03:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
may to to finish it but
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
they can do anything they want with the
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
dollar amount um
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i i would suggest that
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
whatever we do
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
that if
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
there is concern about the absolute
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that we take those
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
concerns to finance
 
03:56:58.389 --> 03:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
when the bill is heard
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
i will get be notified
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
obviously when the bill is going to be
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
heard because it came through this
 
03:57:04.080 --> 03:57:05.189 align:start position:0%
heard because it came through this
committee

03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
and can make sure everybody knows
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
but you can also reach out to members to
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
finance and raise a question about the
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
and then it would be up to them to
 
03:57:17.439 --> 03:57:18.630 align:start position:0%
and then it would be up to them to
question

03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
whoever comes to testify in support of
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
the bill or whether that dollar amount
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
is could be lowered because i'm sure
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's recommending that we raise it
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:31.760 --> 03:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.150 --> 03:57:36.160 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chair
 
03:58:38.309 --> 03:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
i first like to say that uh
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
it does seem and it's i questioned it
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
myself the
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
short time period by the time that
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will be approved and get
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
through the process and when it has to
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
be handed in
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i also feel quite confident that
 
03:58:54.150 --> 03:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that nothing's going
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be done in the meantime or lined up
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i have all confidence
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
that there will be preliminary type
 
03:59:04.870 --> 03:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
arrangements made in that the report
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
in on time on november 1st
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
really good uh ad addition to the
 
03:59:12.720 --> 03:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
really good uh ad addition to the
seacoast

03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
